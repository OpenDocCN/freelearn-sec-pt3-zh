    forensic imaging and indexing of increasingly larger datasets is becoming unviable.
    It introduces new forensic processes and tools to assist in more sound recovery
    of evidence and better use of resources. The chapter introduces the advent of
    **disruptive technology** that is challenging the established digital forensic
    response and overreliance on forensic specialists, who are themselves becoming
    swamped with heavier caseloads and limited ability to process larger and disparate
    datasets.

    in the government and private sectors to meet the growing demand for qualified
    practitioners. Many of these entrants to the discipline gain employment with forensic
    laboratories now undertaking digital forensic examinations. More recently, budgetary
    constraints are affecting many digital forensics laboratories, which have seriously
    restricted staffing numbers and specialist training. At the same time, the dramatic
    increase of laboratories' caseloads can have a detrimental effect on the soundness
    of the work output. Simply put, forensic laboratories are expensive in terms of

    personnel who are not always readily available. It is more common for organizations
    to integrate digital forensics as a part of security-incident response programs.
    Digital forensic examinations can be costly in terms of time and manpower, as
    are the laboratories that provide these services. Law enforcement agencies, defense

    the evidence and traditionally required a high level of expertise. Often, no more
    than a small percentage of the image is of evidentiary value. Moreover, the practitioner

    cases where forensic imaging was undertaken, it was an overindulgent and unjustified

    for example, is also time-consuming, often taking days and weeks, and the large
    number of search hits for review are often overwhelming to process. Evidence examinations
    are hampered by the limited processing capabilities of human analysts, which are
    further aggravated by the increase in the size of datasets and post-processing
    reviews. The opportunities for practitioners to complete meticulous reviews of
    all captured evidence and search large datasets for evidence has long since passed
    and clearly signals a need for better digital evidence capture and processing.

    organizations, so the concept of "evidence" is slightly different. However, civil
    investigations sometimes result in evidence recovered being used in criminal trials,
    disciplinary hearings, and other tribunal proceedings, such as unfair dismissal
    cases. Usually, cases that center on e-discovery require the litigants to identify
    information relevant to the legal action, by completing searches across their
    networks and storage systems. Any documents that are identified as relevant to
    the action are extracted, processed to remove irrelevant documents, and provided
    to the requesting litigant. Note that no forensic imaging has taken place.

    tools to prioritize and select documents for review, typically considered cost
    savers but an inferior alternative to tedious, manual reviews requiring the assessment
    of each document in response to a production request and to determine privilege.
    *Grossman and Cormack* (2011) quote the *Sedona Conference Best Practices Commentary
    on the Use of Search and Information Retrieval Methods in E-Discovery*, which
    cautions that "[t]here appears to be a myth that manual review by humans of large
    amounts of information is as accurate and complete as possible – perhaps even
    perfect – and constitutes the gold standard by which all searches should be measured.
    Even assuming that the profession had the time and resources to continue to conduct
    manual review of massive sets of electronic data sets (which it does not), the
    relative efficacy of that approach versus utilizing newly developed automated
    methods of review remains very much open to debate."

    of a suspect or prevent harm to others or severe damage to property have an overriding

    of relevant data may take place when desired, although, unlike a forensic imaging,
    it will be a logical copy of the data and not a bit-for-bit exact physical image
    that would facilitate locating hidden and deleted files. For a 1-terabyte network

    holdings relating to every employee or manager, and may from the outset focus
    on one or more employees. On the other hand, it may be unclear as to what the
    identity of possible culprits is, but an event or subject matter may provide links

    for evidence, but what if the network is dispersed and it is impractical to consider
    imaging the large dataset? Copying and restoring an image of a network is time-consuming
    and can take between a day and several days to complete. So much data is saved,
    yet little of it is required. If the appointed investigator is tasked to look
    for only certain parts of the network thought relevant to the incident, there
    is no guarantee that they will contain all the available evidence. Staff terminals
    also take time to image and then search for evidence, and this is not without
    its challenges, as will be demonstrated in [Chapter 6](ch06.html "Chapter 6. Selecting
    and Analyzing Digital Evidence"), *Selecting and Analyzing Digital Evidence*.

    use and commend the use of the ISeek automaton to locate and recover data of potential

    the time benefit of being able to interrogate a server and desk terminals using

    the investigation is seeking the e-mails of only one or perhaps two internal users,
    for a specified time frame, engaging in certain activities. The automaton can
    be configured to look for e-mails and attachments in the context of the inquiry.
    It can filter by file size, type, and periods of time to avoid processing unnecessary
    data and speed up the process of locating evidence and leads for further inquiry.

    sets to be filtered and cataloged efficiently so as to reduce the time spent on
    and tedium experienced by the examining team personnel. The same stratagem used
    by law enforcement agents to search for and contain selected data applies here.
    Moreover, while the administrator may be able to isolate a user and e-mail accounts,
    the possibility remains that information of value may be overlooked in other locations
    on the server not evident to the examining team. The team may lack sufficient
    technical knowledge and experience regarding the less likely locations of evidence.
    The automaton does not have to rely on extracting large datasets and can work
    quickly and efficiently on those drives where evidence may sit.

    can be involved in configuring the search terms, which can be launched on the
    server or terminal without the installation of any software application and without
    the physical presence of a forensic practitioner. This broadens the scope of investigations
    that may otherwise be delayed or abandoned because of the cost of hiring an expensive
    practitioner and associated travel and accommodation costs. It can all be accomplished

    size of datasets that makes it difficult to seek digital evidence without considerable
    expenditure of time, money, and human resources. The questionability of conventional
    forensic image protection has also been highlighted. The continuing use of forensic
    imaging is predicted to become less prevalent because of the concomitant increase
    in the size of secure data stores to preserve the evidence and related resource
    costs. The use of better tools to process large datasets, identify important evidence,
    and preserve it in more modest storage sizes is urgently needed.

    not just in the e-discovery field, but also in law enforcement and the intelligence
    community—communities facing escalating costs, reduced manpower, and limited time
    to process information in a timely manner. Information managers and the legal
