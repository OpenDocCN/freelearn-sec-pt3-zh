<p class="mce-root">Being able to accurately view and analyze results is an important part of any investigation. Even before the final results stage, however, it can be useful to be able to look at and manipulate different factors within a case, so as to work out where it might be necessary to drill down further, and to uncover correlations that otherwise may be overlooked.</p>
<p class="mce-root">While the primary goal of digital forensics tools is not to look pretty but to uncover, analyze, and report back on data, the visualization process is nonetheless an important part of any software.</p>
<p class="mce-root">A well put together data visualization tool can demonstrate links between contacts, build a timeline and identify potential points of interest along it, bring to light geographical areas that may be relevant to an investigation, and give basic statistical outputs that can lead an investigator to understand which steps should be taken next, among other things.</p>
<p class="mce-root">In this chapter, we will be looking at data visualization techniques and options in three forensic suites. First, we will look at <strong>AccessData's</strong> FTK and how it reports visually on important areas for investigation. <span>We will then go through open-source freeware Autopsy and discuss how to create a timeline. Finally, we will take a look at Nuix's suite of forensic tools, including their new Web Review &amp; Analytics add-on which sits on top of Nuix Investigator Lab.</span></p>

<p>This tool allows you to create and filter timelines, split data into categories, view emails and related metadata, analyze traffic and social connections, and observe geolocation data in a user-friendly environment. It also allows the user to specify a particular theme or color scheme, giving it a customizable feel.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">How to do it...</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p class="mce-root">There are various possible uses for the visualization tool, so we will go through them one at a time:</p>
<ol>
<li>Firstly, you can change the theme of FTK should you wish to do so. You can do this by going to <span class="packt_screen">CaseManager<span><span>|</span></span></span><span class="packt_screen">Tools<span><span>|</span></span></span><span class="packt_screen">Preferences</span> in FTK, which will then open up a box which lists several options. These correspond closely to the options that used to be available in older versions of Windows, so it should be familiar to many.</li>
<li>One of the most useful items in the visualization toolset is the timeline feature, which allows a user to view actions on a device over a specific time period.
<ol>
<li>First you must tell FTK which dates you want to focus on. You can do this by selecting a range of dates in the timeline section.</li>
<li>Once your date range has been loaded in the Timeline, you will see three horizontal sections on the page:
<ul>
<li>The first section is the timeline itself, which shows different items of interest within the range of dates you have specified.</li>
<li>The middle section is the Dashboard, which adds extra details about the data in the timeline. Here you can see your data broken down by category - for example, the percentage of emails compared with images, files, and other items of interest.</li>
<li class="mce-root">Similarly, the bottom section is the Data List, which is structured similar to the rest of FTK and so should be easy to navigate. Like the name suggests, it provides a list of items that can then be selected individually should you wish to drill down further.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li>Once you have a date range in front of you, it is then possible to zoom in on a more specific time frame. For example, if you can see that a lot of activity has happened on a specific date, you can use the sliders to look only at that date in more detail. Likewise, you can focus on a specific hour, minute, or even second.</li>
<li>Taking a look at the Dashboard section in more detail, if you select the <span class="packt_screen">Categories Distribution Chart</span> on the <span class="packt_screen">Overview</span> tab, it will zoom in and show you your data broken down into categories. These will vary depending on your case, however popular options include folders, documents, emails, and graphics.</li>
<li class="mce-root">If you click on any particular category, it will then show up in the <span class="packt_screen">Data List</span> pane at the bottom of the screen. This will allow you to sort and analyze data within a specific category. Sorting the data is easy: simply click on the heading that you are interested in and drag it onto the blue bar above. Once you have sorted your data, you can then scan the list and mark any items that should be explored further. To mark an item, select it in the <span class="packt_screen">Data List</span> and then choose <span class="packt_screen">Mark Selected Items</span> <span>on the right-hand side of the screen. A box will then pop up which gives you various choices, including adding a label or creating a bookmark.</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Lets take the example of an email — say you have found a message of interest and want to learn more about who sent it and what their motivations might have been. The easiest way to do this is using the Social Analyzer tool. To access this, simply select the email you want to find out about and then click <span class="packt_screen">Social Analyzer</span> <span>above the list.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<ol start="6">
<li class="mce-root">This tool contains a wealth of information and is very easy to use. First of all, you will see a box containing several bubbles, within each of which will be a name. These are the domain names with which the user most frequently communicates. The larger the bubble, the more often emails are sent to and from people at these domains. This can especially be of interest in instances of intellectual property fraud, or when investigating disgruntled employees. Clicking on any one of these bubbles will make lines appear between them. These lines demonstrate how many messages have been sent and received between different domains. The thickness of the line indicates the amount of traffic between the domains.</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">You can then expand the domain names to see a list of individual users. Hovering over a specific user will show their email address. You will also see more bubbles popping up around the individual user - like with the earlier example of domains, these bubbles show which individuals this user has emailed. Once again, the size of the bubble indicates the level of connection. If you want to exit the Social Analyzer tool and continue working on the case based on data you have found there, you can click <span class="packt_screen">Post Results Back</span> <span>on the left-hand side of the screen and then check</span> <span class="packt_screen">Label</span> <span>in the pop-up box that appears. This will label all the emails you have been looking at, so that when you navigate back to your main case view you will be able to sort data based on this.</span></p>
<ol start="7">
<li>Internet history is another popular source of forensic information, and FTK's Visualization tool has several options here as well. It covers all the most popular browsers and once again lets you put data from this into a timeline and then drill down to more specific points of interest. However, you can only view data from one browser at a time. In the case you have loaded, go to <span class="packt_screen">Evidence|Additional Analysis|Evidence Processing</span> and select <span class="packt_screen">Process Internet Browser History for Visualization</span>. This will bring up a timeline. Once you are in the Timeline view, you can navigate around it in exactly the same way you would with email data, by clicking on individual dates and items to drill down into the details. Again, you can label items by selecting them from the list and then clicking <span class="packt_screen">Mark Selected Items</span> on the right-hand side of the screen. This will allow you to label them so that you can access them within the main case.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="8">
<li>Geolocation data can provide a wealth of useful information and opportunities for further investigation, and it has the added bonus of being easy to understand even for a non-technical client. Geolocation is automatically turned on in FTK cases, however you must be connected to the internet in order to access it. For this reason, it may be worth shutting down a live case you are working on and opening a duplicate one in order to prevent potential contamination of data. Once you have selected the <span class="packt_screen">Geolocation</span> tab, you will be able to see your data spread across the world. You can then drill down into a specific region by clicking on the bubble over the country or area you would like to examine. Clicking on a bubble will zoom in on the map and show you specific points of interest. You can then click on one of the points to see details about what happened in this location. After selecting your specific location, you can right-click on it, which will bring up several options. These will allow you to change the color of the pin or change it to an icon, view the precise location in longitude and latitude, and mark the location either by labeling it or creating a bookmark. Once again, any labels added can then be processed back in the main case.</li>
</ol>

<p class="mce-root">The visualization tool works by using a graphical interface to highlight important elements within a case. It structures these either by time or by location, depending on the preferences set by the user.</p>
<p class="mce-root">Drilling down within the visualization tool allows for extra analysis of the dataset, and also enables the user to mark specific items of interest which can then be reviewed within the main case.</p>

<p class="mce-root">Autopsy is a popular piece of open source freeware with many advocates in the digital forensics community. The tool performs all the basic functions required for investigative work, and also makes it easy for technical users to extend it by creating compatible plugins.</p>
<p class="mce-root">The timeline feature is generally loaded within a case that is already running, and ideally needs to have several options enabled in order to be used efficiently, these being:</p>
<ul>
<li class="mce-root">Hash lookup with NSRL</li>
<li class="mce-root">Recent activity</li>
<li class="mce-root">EXIF data</li>
</ul>

<p class="mce-root">First, load up your case in Autopsy and then click <span class="packt_screen">Timeline</span> at the top of the page. A new window will now open, which will give you access to the Timeline feature.</p>
<p class="mce-root">Although Autopsy's Timeline feature does not have as many bells and whistles as FTK's Visualization tool or Nuix's Web Review &amp; Analytics add-on, it is nonetheless a great starting point for drilling down into digital forensic data.</p>

<p>At first glance, you will see a bar graph which shows the number of things that have taken place each year. Clicking on a given year will break that period down into months; <span>clicking on a particular month will break the timeline down into days; then, finally, clicking on days will bring you an hour-by-hour timeline view. There are currently no more granular levels than this.</span> <span>The following image shows a timeline broken down by month:</span></p>

<p class="mce-root">The procedure to prepare a timeline in Autopsy:</p>
<ol>
<li>Once you have chosen your time period, you will be able to visualize any relevant data in the bottom left-hand corner of the screen. Here you will see a list of items of interest; precisely what is shown there will depend on the options you selected when you loaded your case. Clicking on any one of these listed items will generate a preview in the pane in the bottom right of the screen, as shown in the following figure:</li>
</ol>
<p class="mce-root"><img class="image-border" src="assets/11e2fe38-6df4-40f3-96d1-7b7ef64d295d.png"/></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Fig 11.2. The preview panel will show up in the bottom right of the screen</div>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Clicking on the line separating the preview and list panes from the timeline view above will allow you to resize the previews.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>To the left of the screen, in the main timeline view, you will see several options. These allow you to tell Autopsy what it is you are particularly interested in uncovering within your case. Selecting any number of these options will mean that Autopsy will automatically color code them and add them to the timeline view, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>

<div class="mce-root CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Fig 11.3. Applying filters to a timeline</div>
<ol start="3">
<li>Once you have found your items of interest, you can right click on them within the list pane and go to <span class="packt_screen">T</span><span class="packt_screen">ag Result,</span> which will then allow you to give them a tag of your choice, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<div class="mce-root CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="image-border" src="assets/95bf2ac0-2a50-4f00-92a7-2c1f6368f8c3.png"/></div>
<div class="mce-root CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Fig 11.4. Tagging results in a timeline</div>
<ol start="4">
<li>Looking along the top of the screen, you will see three options next to <span class="packt_screen">View Mode</span>: Counts, Details, and List. Clicking <span class="packt_screen">Details</span> will show a different view of the timeline, with horizontal rather than vertical bars, and with added details regarding each item, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<div class="mce-root CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="image-border" src="assets/37878442-345c-4a8e-b332-1550d7ab2313.png"/></div>
<div class="mce-root CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Fig 11.5. The <span class="packt_screen">Details</span> view in Timeline</div>
<ol start="5">
<li>Likewise, the <span class="packt_screen">List</span> pane will show the data in a vertical list, without any kind of graphical interface. This can be useful as it still arranges data by time frame, but it is more detailed and can be easier to sort, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<div class="mce-root CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="image-border" src="assets/3e75f8e4-d68e-414d-b726-4ecba8ffee17.png"/></div>
<div class="mce-root CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Fig 11.6. The List view is the most detailed</div>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Data can then be exported in HTML, as an Excel document, or as a <kbd>TSK</kbd> file. The timeline itself will not show up automatically in a report, so if you want this to be included you will have to screenshot it and add it in manually later on.</p>

<p class="mce-root">Autopsy's Timeline feature is essentially a stripped-back version of the timeline tools included in commercial forensic suites. It works by analyzing the data within the case you have entered, and then arranging that data within a given time period.</p>
<p class="mce-root">Because Autopsy is an open source tool, it is possible to create your own add-ons which may be helpful in bespoke investigative circumstances.</p>

<p class="mce-root">Sometimes a case is more complex than simply uncovering data from a single source and reporting back on it. Particularly in law enforcement investigations, there will often be many different people working on the same case, some of whom are non-technical investigators, and this makes it important for multiple individuals to be able to view, sort through, and report back on data regardless of their level of technical knowledge.</p>
<p class="mce-root">Nuix's solution to this is its Web Review &amp; Analytics tool, which sits on top of its eDiscovery and Director suites and allows multiple users to collaborate.</p>

<li class="mce-root">One neat feature of Nuix's Web Review &amp; Analytics tool is its ability to create individual metadata profiles. If you are working as part of a team, for example, and one person deals with images while another is tasked with analyzing all data from a particular mobile device, you can easily create a metadata profile for each of these users, leading to fewer problems with cross-contamination of data and aiding in triage. To create an individual metadata profile, simply click <span class="packt_screen">Global Options</span> <span>at the top of the screen, select</span> <span class="packt_screen">Create a metadata profile</span><span>, and follow the instructions to set it up.</span></li>
<li class="mce-root">The reporting section within Web Review &amp; Analytics is particularly useful, due to its usability both in terms of being able to drill down into the details, and being accessible for non-technical users. The graphs and charts are easy to read, and each one can be clicked for more information, which will then take a user back to the Grid view and allow them to deep dive into the results. In the following example, the user has told Nuix Web Review &amp; Analytics to show a list of languages, which is a built-in feature. The tool can detect which languages are being used throughout a dataset and then structure these into an easy-to-read graph such as the following one. This allows users to break data down into individual components which can then be looked at further.</li>

<p style="padding-left: 60px" class="mce-root">Reports can be downloaded as PDFs or a variety of other common file types. However, one of the most popular ways of reporting in Web Review &amp; Analytics is by simply creating a new user with no administrative privileges and only the ability to view, rather than to manipulate, the data within the case. That way, a client or customer can log into Web Review &amp; Analytics and view in detail the specific items that interest them the most.</p>

<p>Nuix's Web Review &amp; Analytics works by taking a web-based interface concept and applying this to large-scale digital forensic investigations. This makes it easier to triage large cases, to avoid accidental cross-contamination of data and preserve the chain of custody, and to keep track of who is working on which part of a case.</p>
