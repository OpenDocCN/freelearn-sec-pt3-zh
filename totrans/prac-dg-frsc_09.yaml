    matter, consider the location of an incriminating e-mail found in the **Sent Mail**

    examination (all too common), since there is a typically implied presumption of
    guilt because the computer owner is the one most likely responsible for its creation
    and dispatch. In an evidence-led examination, the evidence is examined objectively
    without bias and faulty intuition, and an attempt is made to determine its antecedents
    and links to possible transgressors. Knowing the full processes involved in this
    alternative type of examination, the courts would prefer such an objective process

- en: In this example, the simple statement that the e-mail file was in the outbox
    suggests that it was sent by some user of the computer—well, it was or it wasn't.
    But in reality, checking its antecedents raises a range of questions, including
    determining whether there was a "hack", whether it was sent from another computer
    and synchronized to the suspect's computer, whether the timestamps were anomalous,
    or whether the message has been manipulated. If the response to each of these
    questions is a yes or no or even uncertain, it is possible, with careful attention
    to detail, to make some sense of what happened, but that still requires a measure
    of likelihood because of the result. If the answers to some or all questions are
    uncertain, that increases doubt as to the reasonableness of the evidence; consequently,
    some testing, checking, and, if possible, corroboration of the evidence, is necessary

    as biased and faulty interpretation of digital evidence are not that uncommon.
    This is unhelpful, as it can aggravate cases where the evidence, if successfully

    application that harnesses the statistical database, the model produces an output
    statement stating the validity of the evidence artifact. The statistical database
    consists of a broad collection of information questions relating to the relevance
    of the evidence objects being examined. The questions require empirical proof
    to show that they and the range of associated answers were appropriate for inclusion
    in the statistical database. A wide range of digital evidence artifacts may be
    validated on the basis of whether they meet specific conditions of admissibility
    requiring a simple `Yes`, `No`, `Unsure`, `Discounted` or `Cannot Be Determined`

    The lawful admissibility of evidence requires that some legal process be followed
    to permit the seizure and examination of exhibits or that the lawful owner grant
    permission for its acquisition. Except in exceptional conditions, it must normally
    be confirmed that evidence was acquired lawfully for it to be tendered during
    a trial. The legitimacy of the circumstances of the seizure of an exhibit, such
    as a mobile phone under a search warrant, may seem straightforward, provided there
    are no special conditions that require closer compliance with the order.

    it is more likely than not that remote access did not occur. The results of the
    checking can also show that the evidence is less likely to implicate the computer
    owner as other user access is implied through remote access. The process may also
    show that the likelihood of other user access is uncertain or may not be possible

    and used during a period the transgression took place. The practitioner may or
    may not confirm the existence of the application on the computer, because it may
    have been uninstalled or deleted without a trace and the logging files may not
    be present. If that proves inconclusive, checking other system records, such as
    the Event Viewer and Registry, may reveal the previous use of the application.
    Some indication that remote access was enabled by the application at or close
    to the time of the transgression of course raises the possibility of unauthorized
    use of the computer. This example is used to demonstrate the model's ability to
    process reasoned input and provide a useful output prognosis.

    access applications were ever present on the computer. If this is confirmed, the
    implications this may have on the nature of transgression events should, as a
    matter of course, be considered. A diligent practitioner would check whether the
    application file metadata shows that the application was installed prior to the
    installation. If its previous installation were confirmed, then the focus would
    be on whether the application and system logs show that the application was used
    at the time of the transgression.

    of stealing the intellectual property of the employer. Suspicion arose when the
    CCTV footage of the office detected the employee's presence at his workstation
    during out-of-office hours for a 2-hour period—unusual activity for staff members.
    Scrutiny of the CCTV footage showed a partial view of what appeared to be the
    employee's laptop, on which could be observed the opening of files on the desktop.

    including images, spreadsheets, and some text documents, at the same time as the
    CCTV footage. The server logs also showed synchronization between the server and
    the e-mail account on the laptop. The employee's service was terminated 3 months
    later after the employer became aware that the employee was joining a rival company
    and of other innuendo as to his disloyalty.

    on the laptop, its property, to monitor browsing activities of interest. The legality
    of this action is questionable. After the departure of the employee, the IT administrative
    staff carried out an examination of the laptop to seek information that might
    incriminate the employee. They installed various applications in an attempt to
    recover deleted files, but with no success. At this late juncture, the services
    of a forensic practitioner were sought to look for evidence to decide whether
    there were sufficient grounds to lodge a complaint to police.

    was most likely removed during the process of decommissioning the device after

    features to confirm that it was the one shown in the CCTV footage, even though
    the suspected employee could be seen using its keyboard. There was no record on

    after the alleged transgression, and earlier browsing records linked to the software
    website. The application makes a clone of the laptop, which means if it was used,
    it would allow the user to keep a full record of the data for possible future
    use. Data saved by such a process allows the user to reinstall the data on another
    machine and make the data available. It was not possible to determine whether
    the application was used to clone the device; however, the possibility exists
    that this may have occurred. Who loaded and installed the application could not
    be determined, and it may not have been the employee, as the integrity of the
    laptop data had been compromised, to some extent, by the handling of it by personnel
    prior to the forensic examination.

    possession of the company''s property and using it to exploit business opportunities
    kept private from the company. Whether this information was sufficient to substantiate
    a case of theft or misuse of intellectual property is uncertain, but actually,
    it was not the concern of the practitioner. Why this unremarkable, but not uncommon,
    type of case is presented here is because it showed the company in a poor light
    and highlights some of the challenges confronting practitioners:'

    case looked weak, with the client expecting that the forensics would provide more
    collateral—sometimes it does; sometimes it has the opposite effect.

    the practitioner's report. This was refused on ethical and procedural grounds,
    with the client being sharply told that the practitioner was the servant of the
    court, not of the client, and was not an investigator subject to client manipulation.
    This denial by the practitioner was supported by the client's lawyer.

    and honest account, the legal team would have charged ahead, ready to prosecute
    or litigate with a reasonable chance of cowing the employee into admitting some
    responsibility and guilt.

- en: Had the practitioner succumbed and deleted the contamination information, it
    was suspected that the client would have filibustered the employee with what appeared
    to be a sound case, hoping to cower the employee into admitting the suspected
    transgression. But once the practitioner becomes aligned with the wishes of the
    client, it is a slippery slope into perdition. Often, the opposing legal team
    will discover that full and open disclosure of all the evidence was not made.
    This can result in the case being thrown out of court and the reputation of practitioner
    being damaged, perhaps permanently.

    the need to validate evidence to determine its relevance and authenticity in anticipation
    of it being tendered in legal proceedings. The process stressed the importance
    of testing and checking the evidence to ensure it is what it purports to be. This
    included the discussion of a more structured analysis of the evidence collected,
    including the development and testing of hypotheses and counterarguments in line
    with forensic standards.

    the need for a more pragmatic approach to manage digital information that may
    be relied on in legal hearings. It will describe ways of empowering digital forensic
    practitioners and other stakeholders through better processes. I will highlight
    trends in digital forensic practice and the need to adopt better strategies for
    managing increasingly large and complex datasets. Also introduced will be processes,
    tools, and forensic contingency strategies that increase stakeholder awareness
    of and competency in managing digital information held in their trust.'
