- en: This book is a complete discussion of state-of-the-art technology used in identification,
    acquisition, and forensic analysis of mobile devices with the iOS operating system,
    and it has been extended and updated to iOS 8 and 9. It is a practical guide that
    will help investigators understand how to manage scenarios efficiently during
    their daily work on this type of mobile device. The need for a practical guide
    in this area arises from the growing popularity of iOS devices and the different
    scenarios that an investigator may face, according to the type of device, the
    version of the operating system, and the presence or absence of security systems
    (code lock, backup password, and so on). The book is divided (conceptually) into
    four parts. The first part deals with the basic concepts related to methods and
    guidelines to be followed in the treatment of digital evidence and information
    specific to an iOS device. The second part covers the basic techniques and tools
    for acquisition of an iOS device, also through a backup and iCloud. The third
    part goes deep into the methodology and techniques for analyzing the data. Finally,
    the fourth part provides an overview of issues related to the analysis of iOS
    applications and malware. For those who are new to this field, we recommend a
    sequential reading of the book, since the arguments are processed in the order
    of the main phases of a forensic investigation (identification, acquisition, and
    analysis). For the more experienced readers, and for those who routinely deal
    with this type of device, the book can be considered as a useful tool to evaluate
    different techniques, depending on the type of case that you have to handle.

- en: This book is designed to allow you to use different operating platforms (Windows,
    Mac, and Linux) through freeware, open source software, and commercial software.
    Many of the examples shown can be replicated using either the software tested
    by the authors or equivalent solutions that have been mentioned in [Appendix B](apb.html
    "Appendix B. Tools for iOS Forensics"), *Tools for iOS Forensics*. Some specific
    cases require the use of commercial platforms, and among those, we preferred the
    platforms that we use in our daily work as forensic analysts (such as Cellebrite
    UFED, Oxygen Forensics, Elcomsoft iOS Forensic Toolkit, and Elcomsoft Phone Breaker).
    In any case, we were inspired by the principles of ease of use, completeness of
    information extracted, and the correctness of the presentation of the results
    by the software. This book is not meant to be a form of advertisement for the
    aforementioned software in any way, and we encourage you to repeat the tests that
    are carried out on one operating platform even on other platforms and software
    applications.

- en: This book is intended mainly for a technical audience, and more specifically
    for forensic analysts (or digital investigators) who need to acquire and analyze
    information from mobile devices running iOS. This book is also useful for computer
    security experts and penetration testers because it addresses some issues that
    must be definitely taken into consideration before the deployment of this type
    of mobile devices in business environments or situations where data security is
    a necessary condition. Finally, this book can be also of interest for developers
    of mobile applications, and they can learn what data is stored in these devices
    where the application is used. Thus, they will be able to improve security.
