    The blog mostly talks about using free forensic tools and acquisition techniques,
    which in our opinion can limit the available acquisition options and require more
    time and effort than an examiner may have at their disposal. However, the information

    2011, most Android smartphones use eMMC flash chips for non-volatile storage.
    Unlike the *plain* flash chips, eMMC storage integrates flash memory and controller
    onto a single chip planted into the phone's main board. The built-in controller
    is responsible for flash-specific operations to maintain data integrity while
    ensuring the optimum performance and lifespan of the NAND cells. The controller
    performs, among other things, operations such as trimming unused data blocks,
    remapping logical addresses to physical chips. The controller is also responsible
    for performing secure data erasure when requested.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Internally, the built-in controller is responsible for establishing a link between
    addressable (logical) storage space and physical blocks in the flash chip. In
    other words, each logical block is mapped to a corresponding physical block by
    the eMMC controller. The reverse, however, is not true—we cannot say that each
    physical block has a corresponding addressable logical block assigned.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: eMMC chips have more actual storage capacity than they advertise to the outside
    world. The extra physical data blocks are therefore non-addressable until called
    into service by the integral eMMC controller. This feature is called overprovisioning.
    Overprovisioned data blocks have no logical addresses. Any *bad sectors* (unstable
    or unreadable data blocks) will be permanently placed into the overprovisioned
    area. They'll never be assigned a logical address or be visible to the operating
    system, or anything at all, except the built-in eMMC controller.

    These data blocks are only accessible to the internal controller, there is no
    interface available to intentionally access their contents from the outside the
    eMMC chip. As a result, even performing chip-off extraction will not give you
    access to physical blocks from the overprovisioned area, as chip-off extraction
    of eMMC chips is still based on sending commands to the eMMC controller.'

- en: Flash memory has several qualities unique to this type of storage. NAND flash
    chips have a limited lifespan by only supporting a finite number of write-erase
    cycles. After reaching the end of its effective lifespan, the flash chip may continue
    functioning, yet the data retention period may be severely affected (the data
    will get corrupted or disappear completely after the flash storage is powered
    off for a certain amount of time). As a result, the embedded eMMC controller will
    attempt to evenly distribute write cycles among available data blocks. This is
    called wear leveling.

- en: Another quality unique to flash storage is how they write information. Blocks
    must be erased before they can be written to. Erasing a *dirty* flash cell takes
    significantly more time than writing into an already empty block. In order to
    work around this issue, the eMMC controller will perform background garbage collection
    by trimming (erasing) released blocks when the controller is idle. In order to
    make a certain logical address immediately writeable after its content was deleted
    (and the block was advertised as available, but not yet erased), the controller
    may perform address remapping by pointing this logical block to an already empty
    physical cell. Unlike erasing, remapping happens instantly, making the block that
    used to contain deleted data writeable without the wait associated with erasing
    its content.

    versions and among the different OEMs. Full-trim support only came to Android
    in version 4.3 Jelly Bean. Moreover, full-trim support is only guaranteed in devices
    that originally shipped with Android 4.3 or newer, which excludes devices upgrading
    from earlier versions of Android. While some manufacturers implemented trim support
    during the course of updating devices to newer versions of Android, some other
    OEMs never bothered. As a result, a large number of devices that originally shipped
    with Android 4.2 and were updated to Android Kit Kat or even Lollipop never received
    proper trim support.

    of shutting them down. On a side note, simply removing the battery would not trigger

    system? The Android OS (depending on the version) will pass a `trim` command to
    the eMMC controller, telling it that a certain logical block is no longer used.
    The controller assigns a special status of *do not care* to the physical block
    corresponding to this logical address, adding the physical block to the *to be
    erased* list and remapping the logical address to a clean physical block (either
    from an existing address space or from the overprovisioned area).

    being invasive, JTAG is not considered a destructive method by many experts. If
    JTAG is performed carefully, the device, if it was in working order prior to the
    JTAG procedure, will continue to work post JTAG—which is exactly what the test
    port is designed for. From time to time, JTAG can still result in the device being
    rendered inoperable. For this reason, JTAG forensics is normally used when commercial
    forensic tools fail to image the device, or when the device is soft-bricked or
    unbootable. This includes devices locked with an unknown passcode and the **USB

- en: JTAG extraction is a low-level acquisition method that returns raw content of
    the device storage. If full-disk encryption is enabled, JTAG will extract a raw
    encrypted image. Breaking the encryption may or may not be an option, depending
    on the manufacturer (Samsung is renowned for *making things different*), phone
    model, and Android version.

- en: In order to extract a decrypted image, a higher level API must be used. This,
    however, may require unlocking the device with the correct passcode (or an alternative
    method, such as pattern or knock code). Full-disk encryption is active out-of-the-box
    on some Samsung devices, Google-manufactured devices running Android 5 (such as
    Nexus 6 and Nexus 9), as well as some other flagship phones sold by leading manufacturers.

    manufacturers disable TAP on their devices after they leave the factory, so JTAG
    acquisition may not be available even if a TAP port is visibly present.

    JTAG will not bypass the controller and can only obtain access to the device memory
    area allowed by the controller of the device being acquired, unless the examiner
    is using an advanced form of JTAG called **Boundary Scan**. In other words, without
    using the Boundary Scan technique, the overprovisioned area is inaccessible with
    standard JTAG method. Yet, even using the Boundary Scan technique, examiners can
    only access as much information as can be obtained from the embedded storage.
    If the device uses eMMC memory, all extraction requests are still routed through
    the embedded controller integrated into the eMMC chip, which in turn will not
    allow accessing the content of flash chip(s) directly. As a result, the Boundary
    Scan technique is only effective if the device is equipped with plain flash chips,
    which is not the case for up-to-date devices (for example, majority of Android
    smartphones has been using eMMC chips since Android 2.3). Notably, some entry-level
    no-name Chinese smartphones are still equipped with plain flash chips instead
    of eMMC.

- en: Chip-off acquisition is a highly advanced, destructive extraction technique
    that requires attaching wire leads to the PCB contacts or physically removing
    (desoldering) the phone's flash memory chip. Chip-off is considered more difficult
    compared to JTAG; however, the amount of information acquired via chip-off acquisition
    is similar to the amount of data acquired by JTAGging the device. Since most smartphones
    use standard eMMC flash modules, the process is standardized and typically presents
    no surprises to the examiner.

    best. While reading the chips directly produces a complete raw dump of the memory
    chips, the investigator may be faced with an encrypted partition with no decryption
    keys stored anywhere around. In the case of Apple devices, many Samsung phones,
    and some other devices (for example, the Android 5 Nexus line), encryption is
    enforced out-of-the-box and may not be bypassed during or after the chip-off acquisition
    even if the correct passcode is known. Сhip-off acquisition delivers the best
    result when used on unencrypted devices.

    using special eMMC adapters to make a raw dump of the memory chip. If full-disk
    encryption was enabled on the device, on many Android versions prior to Android
    5.0 Lollipop (with the default encryption scheme), it is then possible to attempt
    carving the raw data dump in order to locate and extract the encryption metadata.
    If the encryption metadata is successfully extracted, the analyst can then attempt
    to brute-force the passcode and decrypt the image.
