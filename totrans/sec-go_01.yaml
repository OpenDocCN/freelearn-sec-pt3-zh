- en: Security and privacy, as practical matters, have continued to gain interest,
    especially in the technology industry. The cybersecurity market is booming and
    continuing to grow. The industry moves fast with innovations and research coming
    out constantly. Not only has the interest and speed of security picked up, but
    the scale of applications along with the risk have also grown by orders of magnitude.
    The industry needs a programming language that is simple to learn, cross-platform,
    and efficient on a large scale. Go is the perfect fit, having an extremely powerful
    standard library, short learning curve, and blazing speed.

- en: Go is an open source programming language that was created by Google and distributed
    under a BSD-style license. A BSD license allows anyone to use Go free of charge,
    as long as the copyright notice is retained and the Google name is not used for
    endorsement or promotion. Go is heavily influenced by C, but has simpler syntax,
    and better memory safety and garbage collection. Sometimes, Go is described as
    a modern-day C++. I think that is too much of a simplification, but Go is definitely
    a simple but modern language.

- en: The original goal of Go was to create a new language that is simple, reliable,
    and efficient. As mentioned, Go is heavily influenced by C programming language.
    The language itself is very simple, with only 25 keywords. It was built to integrate
    well with IDEs, but not to be dependent on them. In my experience, anyone who
    has tried Go has found it very user-friendly with a short learning curve.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the main goals of Go was to deal with some of the negative aspects of
    C++ and Java code, while retaining the performance. The language needed to be
    simple and consistent to manage very large development teams.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Variables are statically typed, and applications are compiled quickly to statically
    linked binaries. Having a single statically linked binary makes it very easy to
    create lightweight containers. The final applications run fast as well, running
    close to C++ and Java performance and much faster than interpreted languages such
    as Python. There are pointers, but there is no pointer arithmetic allowed. Go
    does not tout itself as an object-oriented programming language, and it does not
    formally have *classes* in the traditional sense; however, it does contain a number
    of mechanisms that closely resemble an object-oriented programming language. This
    is discussed in more depth in the following chapter. Interfaces are used heavily,
    and composition is the equivalent of inheritance.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Go has many interesting features. One feature that stands out is the built-in
    concurrency. Just put the word "go" before any function call, and it will spawn
    a lightweight thread to execute the function. Another feature that is quite important
    is the dependency management, which is very efficient. The dependency management
    is part of the reason Go compiles incredibly fast. It does not re-include the
    same header files multiple times, the way C++ does. Go also has built-in memory
    safety, and a garbage collector handles clean-up of unused memory. The standard
    library in Go is pretty impressive too. It is modern and contains networking,
    HTTP, TLS, XML, JSON, database, image manipulation, and cryptography packages.
    Go also supports Unicode, allowing all kinds of characters to be used in source
    code.

- en: The Go toolchain is central to the ecosystem. It provides tools to download
    and install remote dependencies, run unit tests and benchmarks, generate code,
    and format code according to the Go formatting standards. It also includes the
    compiler, linker, and assembler, which compile very quickly and also allow for
    easy cross-compiling by simply changing the `GOOS` and `GOARCH` environment variables.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Some features were excluded from the Go language. Generics, inheritance, assertions,
    exceptions, pointer arithmetic, and implicit type conversions were all left out
    of Go. Many features were omitted intentionally, namely generics, assertions,
    and pointer arithmetic. The authors left out some features because they wanted
    to maintain performance, keep the language specification as simple as possible,
    or they could not agree on the best way to implement, or because a feature was
    too controversial. Inheritance was also left out intentionally in favor of using
    interfaces and composition instead. Some other features, such as generics, were
    left out because there was too much debate concerning their proper implementation,
    but they may show up in Go 2.0\. The authors recognized that it is much easier
    to add a feature to a language than to take one away.

- en: Go is a relatively young language, with its inception in 2007 and open sourcing
    in 2009\. It started at Google as a *20% project* with Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike,
    and Ken Thompson. A 20% project means that the project's developers spent 20%
    of their time working on it as an experimental side project. Go 1.0 was officially
    released in March 2012\. It was planned from the beginning to be an open source
    language. Until Go 1.5, the compiler, linker, and assembler were written in C.
    After version 1.5, everything was written in Go.

    a talk at GopherCon 2016 in Denver titled *Porting Go to the IBM z Architecture*Â ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0f4Wgi94eo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0f4Wgi94eo)).

    chose those languages too. They each fill certain roles and have their own strengths
    and weaknesses. Go was an attempt to create a new language that fits the needs
    of Google. They needed software that could perform extremely well under heavy
    loads, support concurrency, and that was easy to read and write, and compile quickly.

    C++ code base that took hours to build because of the way C++ handles dependencies
    and re-includes headers ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bj9T2c2Xk_s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bj9T2c2Xk_s)
    (37:15)). This is why one of Go's main goals was to compile quickly. Go helped
    turn hours of compile time to seconds because it handles dependencies much more
    efficiently than C++.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are a few criticisms that show up repeatedly in the community. Probably
    the most notorious and most-discussed criticism is the lack of generics. This
    leads to repeated code to handle different data types. Interfaces can be used
    to some extent to alleviate this problem. We might see generics in a future release,
    as the authors have shown openness to generics, but they did not rush through
    an important design decision.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The next criticism often heard is the lack of exceptions. The developer must
    explicitly handle or ignore each error. Personally, I found this to be a refreshing
    change. It's not really that much more work, and you have full control over the
    code flow. Sometimes with exceptions you are not positive where it will get caught
    as it bubbles up. With Go, you can easily follow the error-handling code.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Go has a garbage collector that handles memory cleanup. The garbage collector
    has been upgraded over time and continues to improve. The garbage collector does
    have a minor performance impact, but saves the developer a lot of thinking and
    worrying. Go was originally described as a systems programming language, and the
    lack of control over the memory was restrictive for very low-level applications.
    Since then, they have pivoted away from calling Go a systems programming language.
    If you need low-level control over memory, then you will have to write portions
    of code in C.

    to write and has a gentle learning curve. The learning curve and the ease of programming
    is not a major differentiating factor between Go and Python in my opinion. This
    biggest distinction, and where Python falls short, is performance. Python cannot
    compete with Go in terms of performance. Part of it is the interpreted nature
    of Python, but a larger factor is the **global interpreter lock** or **GIL**.
    The GIL prevents the interpreter from using more than one CPU worth of processing
    power, even with multiple threads executing. There are some ways to get around
    this, such as using multiprocessing, but this has its own drawbacks and limitations,
    as it actually forks a new process. Other options are using Jython (Python on

    of short-lived programs can be a significant performance hit. In terms of memory,
    if you need to run several instances of the same application, then the memory
    required to run each JVM can add up. The JVM can also be restricting since it
    creates a sandbox and limits your access to the host machine. Go compiles down
    to native machine code and thus has no need for a virtual machine layer.

    generate an executable named after the directory name. If you write a program,
    it is possible to write a package that contains no main file and is used only

    build`, you run `go install`. You can run it inside a directory, pass it an absolute
    directory path, and pass it a directory path relative to the `$GOPATH`Â environment
    variable or on a file directly. Once a program has been installed, it goes into
    your `$GOBIN`, which you should have already set. You should have already added
    `$GOBIN` to your `$PATH` as well so that you can run the installed programs directly
    from your command line no matter what directory you are currently in. Installing
    is totally optional, but it is convenient for certain programs, especially for
    the ones you want to save or use frequently.
