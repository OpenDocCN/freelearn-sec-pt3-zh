- en: This book covers the Go programming language and explains how to apply it in
    the cybersecurity industry. The topics covered are useful for red and blue teams,
    as well as for developers who want to write secure code, and for networking and
    operations engineers who want to secure their networks, hosts, and intellectual
    property. The source code examples are all fully functional programs. The examples
    are intended to be practical applications that you will likely want to incorporate
    into your own toolkit. Moreover, this book serves as a practical cookbook for
    building your own custom applications. I have also shared other security best
    practices and tricks that I learned.

    of computer security situations. As you work through the book, you will build
    a cookbook of practical applications and building blocks to use in your own security
    tools for use in your organization and engagements. It will also cover some tips
    and trivia regarding the Go programming language and provide many useful reference
    programs to boost your own Go cookbook.

- en: This book will cover several blue team and red team use cases and various other
    security-related topics. Blue team topics, namely steganography, forensics, packet
    capturing, honeypots, and cryptography, and red team topics, namely brute forcing,
    port scanning, bind and reverse shells, SSH clients, and web scraping, will be
    covered. Each chapter relates to a different security topic and walks through
    code examples pertaining to that topic. If you follow this book, you will have
    a cookbook full of useful security tools and building blocks to create your own
    custom tools all in Go.

- en: This book is not an in-depth tutorial on using the Go language. One chapter
    is dedicated to explaining Go; however, it only scratches the surface as compared
    to Alan Donovan and Brian Kernighan's almost 400-page *The Go Programming Language***.**
    Fortunately, Go is a very easy language to pick up and has a quick learning curve.
    Some resources on learning Go are provided, but the reader may need to do some
    supplemental reading if not familiar with Go.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book will not explore cutting-edge security techniques or vulnerabilities
    that are not already well documented. There are no zero-days or grand techniques
    unveiled. Each chapter is dedicated to a different security topic. Each one of
    these topics could have a book written about them. There are experts who specialize
    in each of these fields, so the book does not go in depth on any particular topic.
    The reader will have a solid foundation to explore any topic deeper when complete.

  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is for programmers who are already familiar with the Go programming
    language. Some knowledge of Go is needed, but the reader does not need to be a
    Go expert. The content is aimed at newcomers to Go, but it will not teach you
    everything about using Go. Those new to Go will get to explore and experiment
    with various aspects of Go, while applying it toward security practices. We will
    start with smaller and simpler examples before moving on to examples that make
    use of more advanced Go language features.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The reader is not expected to be an advanced security expert, but at least should
    have a basic understanding of core security concepts. The goal is to work through
    security topics as an experienced developer or security expert who is looking
    to improve their toolset and grow a library of Go reference code. Readers who
    like to build cookbooks full of useful tools will enjoy working through these
    chapters. People who want to build custom tools in Go related to security, networking,
    and other fields will benefit from the examples. Developers, penetration testers,
    SOC analysts, DevOps engineers, social engineers, and network engineers can all
    make use of the contents in this book.
