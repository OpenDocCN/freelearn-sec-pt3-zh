    potential vulnerabilities and attacks. It involves implementing techniques and
    strategies that minimize security risks, making your application more resilient
    to threats. In the context of Python, secure coding ensures that your applications
    are fortified against common threats such as injection attacks, buffer overflows,
    and unauthorized data access. This foundation is essential to protect sensitive
    information, maintain user trust, and ensure the integrity of your systems.
