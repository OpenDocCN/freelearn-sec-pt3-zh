    investigation. Even before the final results stage, however, it can be useful
    to be able to look at and manipulate different factors within a case, so as to
    work out where it might be necessary to drill down further, and to uncover correlations
    that otherwise may be overlooked.

    to uncover, analyze, and report back on data, the visualization process is nonetheless

    build a timeline and identify potential points of interest along it, bring to
    light geographical areas that may be relevant to an investigation, and give basic
    statistical outputs that can lead an investigator to understand which steps should
    be taken next, among other things.

    in three forensic suites. First, we will look at **AccessData's** FTK and how
    it reports visually on important areas for investigation. We will then go through
    open-source freeware Autopsy and discuss how to create a timeline. Finally, we
    will take a look at Nuix's suite of forensic tools, including their new Web Review
    & Analytics add-on which sits on top of Nuix Investigator Lab.

    this by going to CaseManager|Tools|Preferences in FTK, which will then open up
    a box which lists several options. These correspond closely to the options that
    used to be available in older versions of Windows, so it should be familiar to

    date in more detail. Likewise, you can focus on a specific hour, minute, or even
    second.

    sorted your data, you can then scan the list and mark any items that should be
    explored further. To mark an item, select it in the Data List and then choose
    Mark Selected Items on the right-hand side of the screen. A box will then pop

    and want to learn more about who sent it and what their motivations might have
    been. The easiest way to do this is using the Social Analyzer tool. To access
    this, simply select the email you want to find out about and then click Social
    Analyzer above the list.

    all, you will see a box containing several bubbles, within each of which will
    be a name. These are the domain names with which the user most frequently communicates.
    The larger the bubble, the more often emails are sent to and from people at these
    domains. This can especially be of interest in instances of intellectual property
    fraud, or when investigating disgruntled employees. Clicking on any one of these
    bubbles will make lines appear between them. These lines demonstrate how many
    messages have been sent and received between different domains. The thickness
    of the line indicates the amount of traffic between the domains.
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can then expand the domain names to see a list of individual users. Hovering
    over a specific user will show their email address. You will also see more bubbles
    popping up around the individual user - like with the earlier example of domains,
    these bubbles show which individuals this user has emailed. Once again, the size
    of the bubble indicates the level of connection. If you want to exit the Social
    Analyzer tool and continue working on the case based on data you have found there,
    you can click Post Results Back on the left-hand side of the screen and then check
    Label in the pop-up box that appears. This will label all the emails you have
    been looking at, so that when you navigate back to your main case view you will
    be able to sort data based on this.

    Visualization tool has several options here as well. It covers all the most popular
    browsers and once again lets you put data from this into a timeline and then drill
    down to more specific points of interest. However, you can only view data from
    one browser at a time. In the case you have loaded, go to Evidence|Additional
    Analysis|Evidence Processing and select Process Internet Browser History for Visualization.
    This will bring up a timeline. Once you are in the Timeline view, you can navigate
    around it in exactly the same way you would with email data, by clicking on individual
    dates and items to drill down into the details. Again, you can label items by
    selecting them from the list and then clicking Mark Selected Items on the right-hand
    side of the screen. This will allow you to label them so that you can access them
    within the main case.

    for further investigation, and it has the added bonus of being easy to understand
    even for a non-technical client. Geolocation is automatically turned on in FTK
    cases, however you must be connected to the internet in order to access it. For
    this reason, it may be worth shutting down a live case you are working on and
    opening a duplicate one in order to prevent potential contamination of data. Once
    you have selected the Geolocation tab, you will be able to see your data spread
    across the world. You can then drill down into a specific region by clicking on
    the bubble over the country or area you would like to examine. Clicking on a bubble
    will zoom in on the map and show you specific points of interest. You can then
    click on one of the points to see details about what happened in this location.
    After selecting your specific location, you can right-click on it, which will
    bring up several options. These will allow you to change the color of the pin
    or change it to an icon, view the precise location in longitude and latitude,
    and mark the location either by labeling it or creating a bookmark. Once again,
    any labels added can then be processed back in the main case.
