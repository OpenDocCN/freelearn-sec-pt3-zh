                    <h1 class="header-title">How to Get Hired in Cybersecurity, Regardless of Your Background</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>In this chapter, we are going to cover the tips and tricks on getting into cybersecurity as well as helping you to find the right job, with common interview questions based on job skills.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, regardless of how many certifications you have, or how good your honors degree in university was, you will start your new job most probably from the bottom and you need to work your way up. There is no shortcut. The first step toward choosing any career must be identifying your core strength. If you are not a developer and you don't like coding, for example, don't force yourself to become one. This chapter will give you a holistic overview of how to secure a cybersecurity job from scratch. You will be equipped with knowledge of how you should proceed with your job search.</p>
<p>This chapter will take you through the various skill sets needed to kick start your cybersecurity career. And to that end, the following topics will be covered:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cybersecurity talent gap</li>
<li>Cybersecurity jobs that you can fulfill</li>
<li>Getting into cybersecurity from a technical background</li>
<li>Getting started in cybersecurity with a non-technical background</li>
<li>Transitioning from your current technical role</li>
<li>Your journey from first contact to day one at work</li>
</ul>
<p>The following chart from ISACA shows statistics and facts about the skills gap in cybersecurity:</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Getting into cybersecurity from a technical background</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Having prior IT knowledge and skills will be always a plus when trying to get in to cybersecurity. If you can write a code, reverse engineer a piece of software, or at least understand the basics of networking, OSI layers, and so on, that will surely be an added advantage.</p>
<p>Having a technical background does not mean you should have an official degree or certification, but could instead mean that you have a few basic skills that you gained from your hobbies.</p>
<p>If you don't have those skills now, you should atleast know how to gain those skills since you've read every single chapter of this book.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Cybersecurity jobs to target</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Technical cybersecurity jobs require a detailed level of computer knowledge; however, here's the good part: much of the work you do will be learned on the job. Therefore, don't let a desired skill (outlined in the job description) deter you from applying to certain jobs. As you'll read later, there's a difference between required skills and desired skills.</p>
<p>Just as for non-technical cybersecurity jobs, there are a variety of different technical cybersecurity jobs. Some job titles include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Chief Information Security Officer</strong> (<strong>CISO</strong>): CISOs have a whole range of responsibilities, ranging from hiring IT experts to support their work, to providing leadership and training to those less skilled than them. They will also manage individuals, ensuring they are focusing on the right areas of strategy at the right time.</li>
<li><strong>Security engineer:</strong> In this role, you would test the network for vulnerabilities, monitor for security breaches, and develop security plans and policies. You would also mount an incident response in the event of any security breaches.</li>
<li><strong>Incident responder:</strong> An incident responder's job will require them to immediately respond to any new security threats, intrusions, or exploits, as they occur. Part of the job may also involve control of change management, ensuring orderly transitions during software, or hardware fixes, upgrades, and patches.</li>
<li><strong>Cryptographer:</strong> As a cryptographer, you would analyze, decipher, and perhaps even develop encryption algorithms. The goal of these encryption algorithms is to secure data. The idea is that even if a hacker steals data, they wouldn't be able to read it due to the encryption lock.</li>
<li><strong>Computer forensic analyst:</strong> People in this role combine their computer science background with their forensic skills to recover information from computers and storage devices. Analysts are responsible for assisting law enforcement officers with cyber crimes and retrieving evidence.</li>
<li><strong>Malware analyst:</strong> Here, you would stay up to date on the latest viruses found in the wild. Your job would also be to help develop software that would fight or defend against these new viruses.</li>
<li><strong>Penetration tester</strong>: This is the ultimate security job if you associate cybersecurity with hacking. As a penetration tester, you become a hacker; however, you will be an ethical one who must follow strict rules governed by the agreements your company has with a client company. Every action you execute will be documented. Companies hire penetration testers because they want to make sure malicious hackers cannot exploit their networks.</li>
<li><strong>Security consultant</strong>: Security consultant's are responsible for identifying, developing, and implementing security solutions to meet their client's needs.</li>
<li><strong>Security architect</strong>: A security architect is responsible for securing enterprise information by determining security requirements; planning, implementing, and testing security systems; preparing security standards, policies, and procedures; and mentoring team members.</li>
<li><strong>Information security officer:</strong> This person is responsible for establishing and maintaining a corporate-wide information security management program to ensure that information assets are adequately protected. Their responsibilities include developing, implementing, and monitoring the strategic and comprehensive enterprise information security and IT risk management program.</li>
<li><strong>Computer security specialist:</strong> The responsibilities of such professionals include designing and implementing safety measures and controls, monitoring network activity to identify vulnerable points, and acting on privacy breaches and malware threats.</li>
<li><strong>Risk manager</strong>: A risk manager designs and implements an overall risk management process for the organization, which includes an analysis of the financial impact on the company when risks occur.</li>
</ul>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Hard versus soft skills</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Regardless of which industry you work in, you will need some basic soft and hard skills.</p>
<p>Hard skills are what are in your CV; if you have a technical background, and if you are a programmer, then you might know how to use C++ as a penetration tester and Kali Linux. If you're a web developer, you may already know how to defend against SQL injection attacks, which is essential as a cybersecurity developer.</p>
<p>On the other hand, soft skills are typically intangible and difficult to quantify. As we covered in <a href="c70739a3-6fd8-4aa0-a27a-f3c7e16b531c.xhtml">Chapter 7</a>, <em>Networking, Mentoring, and Shadowing</em>, the ability to connect with people or communicate technical topics to a non-technical person can be classified as a soft skill.</p>
<p>As a job seeker, I am sure you are already keeping an eye on LinkedIn or other global job search websites. Once you find a job that you think you will be happy to do, go ahead and apply, or if you think there are some skills missing in you, with this book, now you know how to gain them. In any case, try meeting the hiring manager or recruiter. Even if they don't hire you in your first interview, they might guide you in the right direction. Taking the effort and reaching out to them is already proof to them that you are keen to learn new skills; as we will cover later in interview tips, you might be able to find a common connection point and get hired.</p>
<p>You can read more about Forbes' recommendations for starting a cybersecurity career here: <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurencebradford/2017/02/27/how-to-start-a-lucrative-career-in-cybersecurity/#5896cca71066">https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurencebradford/2017/02/27/how-to-start-a-lucrative-career-in-cybersecurity/#5896cca71066</a>.<br/></p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Getting started in cybersecurity with a non-technical background</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Don't worry if you have a non-technical background. You don't even need to find a technical position if you want to work in the industry. Having a non-technical background means you probably won't have coding and development skills; however, it's possible that certain coding or development skills aren't even necessary to be hired.</p>
<p>Cyber risk analyst and technical writer are just two examples of non-technical cybersecurity jobs. These are positions you could obtain with skills you might already have. For example, a college degree may be the only thing required for an entry-level policy analyst position. If you're an avid writer and have a grasp of grammar, starting as a technical writer isn't a bad idea to get your foot in the door.</p>
<p>As discussed before in <a href="6db093ec-4c27-4f86-8025-b6a5df56780a.xhtml">Chapter 9</a>, <em>Knowledge Check and Certifications</em>, gaining certifications such as a Logical Operations CFR or EC Councils CEH can put you on the fast track with getting a technical cybersecurity position. These certifications can be obtained much faster than a university degree.</p>
<p>Once you get your foot in the door, you will start to gain experience at work, and if you take time to improve yourself through self-training, you can reach to your desired position faster. You should be keen to learn, read, and research. The industry has a huge talent crunch, and the more you learn, the more you will be welcomed.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Transitioning from your current technical role</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>If you are currently working, say as a Microsoft Exchange administrator, focusing on email security could be a good start for your cybersecurity career. Or if you are a system administrator and you have good know-how of operating systems, digital forensics could be your next job, after gaining the required skills, though.</p>
<p>Based on LinkedIn, 89% of surveyed professionals would be interested in hearing from a recruiter, and with this in mind, transition from your current role should not be too tricky. Again, based on LinkedIn, there are roughly half a million cybersecurity job openings in the United States, with a projected need of 1.8 million additional cybersecurity professionals to fill the workface gap by 2022.</p>
<p>When we look at the Asia-Pacific region, there is a shortage of 2.14 million, and Europe, the Middle East, and Africa have a shortage of 140,000 skilled workers, which is projected to be in the millions by 2022.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Demonstrate your worth – before you apply</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Don't forget, most probably, you will be not the only one who will apply for a job. While there are many openings for qualified candidates, job seekers still need to demonstrate that they are not only qualified, but also the best person for the role. Demonstrating value starts years before filling out a job application. Know your stuff, plan your next move, and set yourself apart from others. Don't forget that being skilled is not essential but being dedicated is. You are worth hiring if the following apply:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have thirst for knowledge</li>
<li>You are willing to ask questions and learn</li>
<li>You learn from your mistakes</li>
<li>You enjoy your work</li>
<li>You can communicate empathetically</li>
<li>You know how to say <em>no</em></li>
<li>You have the desire to help people</li>
</ul>
<p>After now having learned how to secure a cybersecurity job, let's explore further and see how you can expand your knowledge base. As you can see in the following diagram, it's really important to learn what is required to make you a cybersecurity professional, and apply your knowledge, and develop an action plan to help you move on:</p>

<p>In the next section, we will discuss how to nurture your cybersecurity knowledge and skill set.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Read, listen, watch, and talk</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Read as much as you can. Packt Publishing has great books on cybersecurity and offers various subscription options. Keep an eye on security websites and blogs. Follow the industry leaders on Twitter/LinkedIn and surround yourself with cybersecurity experts as discussed in <a href="c70739a3-6fd8-4aa0-a27a-f3c7e16b531c.xhtml">Chapter 7</a>, <em>Networking, Mentoring, and Shadowing</em>. Community meetups also are immensely helpful in ramping up your cybersecurity knowledge base.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">What should be in your CV?</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The first step in a job hunt is preparing your CV, and when you're exploring the avenues of cybersecurity, you need to have a CV that packs a punch. In this section, we will walk through the various aspects of CV making and will find out what its must-have elements are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Education history</strong>: Although it's not 100% necessary, having a solid education history can be good proof that you are a good learner. Schools/colleges teach you important skills in communication, writing, business, and project management. A university qualification will ease your way to management positions. Some employers now demand proof of a bachelor's degree before they consider candidates.</li>

<p style="color: black">Candidates think about their next career destination or alternatives for a career. To that end, discussions with family, suggestions from friends, and acquaintances are very important. Candidates search for information about career opportunities and potential employers on the web, at career fairs, at company presentations, or other information days. This is just the beginning of the entire job-hunt journey. There are many milestones that a candidate can cross while looking for jobs and the entire process demands a lot of work and perseverance. The following diagram is a good illustration from Kinesis on how a candidate's journey looks:</p>

<p style="color: black">Now let's shift our focus to the types of job interviews in the cybersecurity domain.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Job interview types</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p style="color: black">A job interview is a formal meeting in which an applicant is asked questions to determine their suitability for a particular job. Job interviews can be conducted face to face, or via phone or video, and could be one-on-one, in a panel, or as a group interview. But no matter what the format, every job interview can be structured in three different ways.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Structured interviews</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p style="color: black">In structured interviews, the questions are planned and created in advance, which means that all candidates are asked the same questions in the same order. This will make it easy for a recruiter to compare candidates answers and hire the right talent.</p>
<p style="color: black">This is what a structured interview comprises:</p>
<ul>
<li style="color: black">Set of questions</li>
<li style="color: black">A scale</li>
<li style="color: black">Grading and comparing the talent to the other candidates</li>
</ul>

<p>A sample Excel worksheet of a structured interview</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Unstructured interviews</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p style="color: black">This is a type of interview where the interviewer will ask questions that are not prepared in advance. This type of interview is also known as an informal or casual interview:</p>
<ul>
<li style="color: black">Unstructured interviews are more personalized</li>
<li style="color: black">Unstructured interviews are a free conversation, which can help to showcase your hidden skills</li>
</ul>
<p style="color: black">This is what will be in an unstructured interview:</p>
<ul>
<li style="color: black">The recruiters will look into your day-to-day interactions; this can be a perfect opportunity to showcase your soft skills</li>
<li style="color: black">The recruiters will look to see whether you can stay focused, and whether you are flexible enough to talk about anything</li>
<li style="color: black">Your body language will also be taken into consideration</li>
</ul>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Semi-structured interviews</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p style="color: black"><strong>Semi-structured interviews</strong> are a type of interview where the interviewer asks only a few predetermined questions while the rest of the questions are not planned in advance. This is a hybrid interview style.</p>
<p style="color: black">This is what will be in a semi-structured interview:</p>
<ul>
<li style="color: black">The recruiters will structure their questions based on your responses</li>
<li style="color: black">The recruiters will see whether you can follow the natural flow of conversation</li>

<p style="color: black">The interview process is tough, not only for the candidates but also for the interviewers. The process is tough because well-looked-after talent will not move from their companies. Keep in mind that people will go where they are invited, but they stay only where they are welcomed. Besides, hiring skilled professionals comes with a cost.</p>

<p>The following are some tips to keep in mind while appearing for an interview:</p>
<ul>

<li>Keep your answers simple (unless needed). If asked, provide details.</li>

<li>Be aware of security news.</li>
<li>Learn about the company, and check whether they have had any incidents.</li>

<p>The following points need to be kept in mind if you have a job offer in hand and are considering whether or not you should accept it:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Benefits and perks:</strong> Make sure to question the details.</li>
<li><strong>Work/life balance</strong>: This should be one of your considerations if you are a person who likes to maintain a balance between work and your personal life.</li>
<li><strong>Opportunity to learn and grow</strong>: This will show whether the company is ready to invest in you.</li>
<li><strong>A manager invested in your growth</strong>: While choosing a new job, you should also evaluate whether the manager/leader you are going to work for is someone who will help you grow in your career. A bad manager can make you really unhappy; regardless of your success in the company, they can force you to leave.</li>
<li><strong>Salary transparency</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p style="color: black">So far, I have covered how you can improve your chances of getting a job. To make this chapter more valuable, I wanted also to add the recruiter's views on talent. You can also check out <a href="f67d2a76-9c2a-4d9e-b104-1f08df5ac4df.xhtml">Chapter 11</a>, <em>Expert Opinions on Getting Started with Cybersecurity</em>, where we asked some questions that can help you to learn from some known industry experts. Being a recruiter might look easy to you, but they have many tasks to do, such as finding talent like <em>you</em> in a short time frame, while there is a huge skills shortage in the market:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign" style="color: black"><img src="img/2c44fbaa-91d4-4b0b-9969-ef20c54c2fe8.png"/></p>
<p style="color: black">As you can see, they have a pre-defined score card, so make sure to read the job description carefully and try to find common ground with it to prove that you are the right candidate.</p>
<p style="color: black">Based on the <em>McKinsey Global Survey</em>, 82% of Fortune 500 executives don't believe that their companies recruit the most talented people. If you follow the right tips, you can train yourself to be the right talent and sign the contract of your dream job:</p>

<p style="color: black">Some recruiters use some additional tools, such as <strong>My Dream Employee</strong>, that help them to identify a remarkable employee:</p>

<p>Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google LLC, said the following when visiting a university:</p>
<p>"So, I remember doing my interviews during the day and people kept asking me 'what do you think of Gmail?' But I hadn't had the chance to use it. I thought it was an April Fools' joke. So, in my first three interviews, I couldn't answer it well because I hadn't used the product. It was only in the fourth interview when someone asked me: 'Have you seen Gmail?' that I said 'no.' He actually showed it to me. And then the fifth interviewer asked 'What do you think of Gmail?' And I was able to start answering it then. And in the final four interviews, I actually told them about what I thought of Gmail and how to improve Gmail. And that's my interview experience."</p>
<p style="color: black">According to CNBC, Sundar Pichai was able to succeed at interview as he was able to display intellectual humility, give a reason with a story behind it, and redirect the conversation.
