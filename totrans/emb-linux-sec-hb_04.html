			<h1 id="_idParaDest-75"><a id="_idTextAnchor151"/>Applying Design Requirements Criteria – the Operating System</h1>&#13;
			<p>In the last chapter, we dove deep into many factors to consider in your hardware platform selection criteria. In earlier chapters, we reviewed other factors to keep in mind as well. Everything has been building up throughout each chapter. Everything ties into the security of a solution – some directly, and others more indirectly.</p>&#13;
			<p>In this chapter, we’re hopefully going to educate you on all the factors that your team needs to consider when choosing the right Linux operating system for your appliance. Upon completion of this chapter, you’ll be ready to finalize your design criteria and actually start building your initial prototypes.</p>&#13;
			<p>Since the late 1990s, I must have tried countless distributions of Linux. In the earliest days, new distributions popped up all over the place. Back before high-speed internet, we used to have to buy monthly Linux magazines that contained CD-ROMs with new distributions. I must have bought hundreds of those magazines over the years. Sadly, only a handful of Linux distributions have survived the test of time and popularity. Over all these years, you could definitely say that I have been and continue to be a true Linux enthusiast.</p>&#13;
			<p>In this chapter, we will cover the following:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>Matching an operating system to your base hardware platform</li>&#13;
				<li>Driver support, vendor support, and stability</li>&#13;
				<li>Enterprise versus community distributions of Linux</li>&#13;
				<li>The life cycle of the operating systems versus your solution</li>&#13;
				<li>Hard costs versus soft costs</li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>Let’s get started.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-76"><a id="_idTextAnchor152"/>Matching an operating system to your base hardware platform</h1>&#13;
			<p>The<a id="_idIndexMarker190"/> calculated selection of the Linux distribution to best fit your hardware platform can be compared to the pairing of a fine wine with your gourmet chef-prepared meal. My hope for the outcome here is that your team can take into consideration all relevant factors, along with the findings of your own research, and finally, be able to come to a general design consensus.</p>&#13;
			<p>This selection process can be quite tedious if you plan to leverage Intel or AMD <code>x86_64</code>-type processors, as virtually all present Linux distributions’ primary platform is such. It’s been this way from the beginning when Linux itself arose as the x86 inexpensive alternative to large expensive RISC systems that run very expensive and proprietary Unix distributions. In 2024, there are at least a hundred distributions of Linux geared toward the <code>x86_64</code> platform. Most are obscure forks of mainstream distributions. I’d say it’s pretty fair to assume that there’s a distribution out there for anyone’s desires.</p>&#13;
			<p>Where the selection gets narrowed down for you is when you decide to build upon a non-x86_64 platform. Power, System z, Arm, or RISC-V as your choice may certainly cut down what you can choose from to fewer than a handful of distributions. Some may see this as limiting, while others might embrace not having to research or even trial implementations of many distributions in their labs.</p>&#13;
			<p>For example, here in my own home lab, I maintain over 20 systems, all paid for by me (not my employer). Although they are expensive to maintain, it is key for me to be able to address the needs of multi-platform and operating system testing. This also affords me the freedom to build what I want, when I want, and utilize whatever tooling I deem appropriate for the task. I build, test, tear down, and repeat over and over again, changing operating systems or the hardware platform itself as needed.</p>&#13;
			<p>Obtaining a strong understanding of the factors considered when pairing your chosen hardware to a secure operating system can be compared to how a chef in a fine restaurant pairs an excellent wine with their culinary delights. The next few sections in this chapter will do just that. We are heading to our architectural kitchen now, so let’s move on and get cooking.<a id="_idTextAnchor153"/></p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-77"><a id="_idTextAnchor154"/>IBM Power</h2>&#13;
			<p>The IBM® Power®<a id="_idIndexMarker191"/> series servers are quite scalable and have quality hardware. These systems operate quite similarly to a mainframe in their ability to carve out sections of physical hardware and dedicate them to an individual operating system. In the Power series, this functionality is referred to as<a id="_idIndexMarker192"/> an <strong class="bold">LPAR</strong> (<strong class="bold">Logical Partition</strong>).</p>&#13;
			<p>This platform is becoming more and more rare, as lightweight systems are plentiful in the embedded Linux systems space.</p>&#13;
			<p>This platform is regarded as a niche for those who utilize it today. Be aware that your operating system choices are greatly limited to paid-for distributions. Red Hat® Enterprise Linux®, SUSE Linux Enterprise Server™, and Ubuntu® appear to be the selections available today.</p>&#13;
			<p>Let’s move on to the next platfor<a id="_idTextAnchor155"/>m.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-78"><a id="_idTextAnchor156"/>IBM System z</h2>&#13;
			<p>The IBM Z® series (AKA System z) mainframe<a id="_idIndexMarker193"/> is obviously the most expensive possible hardware platform for any possible embedded Linux system appliance in existence and also, in my opinion, the ultimate example of the rarest platform for such appliances in existence today.</p>&#13;
			<p>Additionally, this platform is the largest in physical size and, in my professional opinion, quite possibly the hardest to find staffing resources for. If you don’t absolutely demand what benefits the mainframe provides (like massive amounts of hardware-based redundancies), I will definitely state this is not the platform for you. That said, I also doubt that, to this day, there is a hardware platform more fault-tolerant and resilient than the Z series mainframes.</p>&#13;
			<p>However, in the context of today, I must use the great analogy of pets versus cattle, which is basically the service model of cloud-based technologies – using vastly inexpensive expendable machines clustered together (i.e., the cattle) versus a single expensive monolith. As there are countless references to this on the internet, I will leave you to make your own opinion on this methodology.</p>&#13;
			<p>Ultimately, I must concede that the Z machines are the epitome of resiliency and reliability. Sadly, their size and cost alone take them out of 99.99% of the embedded Linux systems market itself. The Z machines are literally the most expensive pets.</p>&#13;
			<p>Options here are limited. Much like<a id="_idIndexMarker194"/> the Power platform, with the Z Series, you are limited to only paid-for distributions such as IBM LinuxOne, zLinux, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux. These seem to be the limited offerings on the market today for those unorthodox embedded Linux platforms.</p>&#13;
			<p>Let’s move on to another platf<a id="_idTextAnchor157"/>orm.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-79"><a id="_idTextAnchor158"/>RISC-V</h2>&#13;
			<p>The latest shiny object in the IoT space is<a id="_idIndexMarker195"/> RISC-V® systems. I recently just picked up my first of <a id="_idIndexMarker196"/>these <strong class="bold">bleeding-edge systems</strong>. Currently, when choosing this platform, your options are not just limited but, additionally, harder to get on the system itself. Remember that this platform is rapidly evolving and growing daily. That said, I personally have high hopes for this emerging platform.</p>&#13;
			<p>As the test unit that I’ve been playing with does not have a UEFI BIOS, installing any operating system on this device is somewhat tedious.</p>&#13;
			<p>Here’s a picture of the sample RISC-V IoT board I was able to secure from Amazon.</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div>&#13;
					<img src="img/B22104_04_01.jpg" alt="Figure 4.1 – Initial generic RISC-V boards available on Amazon" width="733" height="809"/>&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 4.1 – Initial generic RISC-V boards available on Amazon</p>&#13;
			<p>I have just recently started playing with this new hardware, so at the time of writing, support for this emerging platform is quite limited. This is where community distributions really shine, as they are at the bleeding edge of hardware support. Thus far, what I have found available is some compatibility with Debian, Ubuntu, and Fedora®.</p>&#13;
			<p>Ubuntu seems to be the leading distribution here, with Fedora closing in fast. That said, I’m looking forward to a future<a id="_idIndexMarker197"/> where paid enterprise-grade operating systems place this new platform under their support umbrella.</p>&#13;
			<p>We’ll definitely be talking more about this platform in the future. For now, let’s move on to what might just be the most important platform in the entire realm of embedded Linux systems. Let’s move on to the <strong class="bold">Advanced RISC Machine</strong> (<strong class="bold">ARM</strong>) archite<a id="_idTextAnchor159"/>cture.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-80"><a id="_idTextAnchor160"/>ARM</h2>&#13;
			<p>Over the past few years, the <a id="_idIndexMarker198"/>ARM® architecture has gone deep and wide in the ecosystem of embedded Linux systems. As we covered in the previous chapter, ARM is a licensed architecture from the company, Arm, or a blueprint if you will. Hardware manufacturers pick and choose what chips they’re going to put onto their custom boards. Additionally, there’s also a treasure trove of pre-built, extremely inexpensive ARM systems, such as Raspberry Pi-type boards.</p>&#13;
			<p>In this ecosystem, Linux distributions that are the closest to the bleeding edge of what’s new in the Linux world tend to have the greatest adoption. In other words, the community distributions (where most of the latest developer work is tested) are likely to have the deepest compatibility with the newest boards. Distributions such as Raspberry Pi OS, Ubuntu, and Fedora are key players in this space. Other open source projects such as Yocto (<a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/">https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/</a>) also provide Linux users with great build and deployment tools.</p>&#13;
			<p>This gap between community and enterprise is closing fast. With the explosion of IoT devices being created worldwide, the enterprise market has been forced to join in or be left behind. Wind River Linux appears to be a leader in this, especially in terms of industrial ARM systems. The Ubuntu Pro server, SUSE Linux Enterprise Server, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux are not that far behind in their efforts to gain their own lion’s share of the ARM ecosystem.</p>&#13;
			<p>The edge and IoT market is not the only market that the enterprise distributions want to capture. As NVIDIA is now bringing the ARM platform to the data center with their new super-powered AI processing juggernaut systems, which combine large-core-count ARM processors with their GPU chips, NVIDIA Grace Hopper systems will change the computer and operating system landscape globally.</p>&#13;
			<p>ARM support<a id="_idIndexMarker199"/> in all form factors is improving fast. I credit NVIDIA for bringing them to the data center and driving greater platform awareness. ARM is definitely a great platform to consider. Let’s <a id="_idTextAnchor161"/>move on.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-81"><a id="_idTextAnchor162"/>Driver support, vendor support, and stability</h1>&#13;
			<p>As we go through all the hardware platforms<a id="_idIndexMarker200"/> that are available in the Linux <a id="_idIndexMarker201"/>ecosystem, I find it crucial to remind you and your team to ensure that whichever Linux distribution you consider also meets your products’ <a id="_idIndexMarker202"/>needs (and your customers’ expectations).</p>&#13;
			<p>What do I mean by that? Basically, I am recommending that you and your team evaluate more than one operating system before settling on a winner. Ensure that your hardware performs at the expected rate with the candidate operating system. Record metrics. Record package versions. Stress-test your prototypes. This process guarantees that when you compare and contrast the candidates, your team can best decide on what truly should be the best selection.</p>&#13;
			<p>Not all distributions are based on the same kernel versions, which directly impacts which drivers may be included (or, in some cases, deprecated from the distribution). Additionally, depending on your planned hardware, you may also require third-party drivers not included with your distribution. Will these drivers be compatible with your distribution’s kernel and libraries?</p>&#13;
			<p>Moreover, each distribution is curated with a different set of core packages and an extended set of optional packages. Will your distribution support the correct package/version c<a id="_idTextAnchor163"/>ombinations required by your appliance’s applications stack? Will you need to seek third-party libraries or applications to complete your solution?</p>&#13;
			<p>Why am I making you ask all these questions of yourself and the team? Allow me to explain. Sadly, it’s pretty simplistic. Most community distributions do not fully test combinations of packages along with their base kernel. Some community distributions are basically a kitchen sink of what their developers assume you may want to try out, but in actuality, they’re hoping you can assist them in vetting stability and bug reporting.</p>&#13;
			<p>This is again where I make my argument for the adoption of an enterprise Linux operating system of your choice. Enterprise distributions pride themselves on stability, security, support, and binary compatibility because that’s what business demands from them. So, let’s move on to the next section where I dive deeper into this thoug<a id="_idTextAnchor164"/>ht process.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-82"><a id="_idTextAnchor165"/>Enterprise versus community distributions of Linux</h1>&#13;
			<p>In this section, we will discuss community versus enterprise Linux distributions, or, as many of us in the Linux industry refer to them, <em class="italic">free versus fee</em>. What distribution you decide upon is driven by many of the factors we have reviewed in previous chapters. Compliance, support, longevity, and your own general needs will come into play here.</p>&#13;
			<p>This point of the selection criteria not only impacts the bottom line of building the appliance but can also better position your product as more secure, as the enterprise distributions bring security features, documentation, training opportunities, automation, tools, and best practice acumen to support your team.</p>&#13;
			<p>Paid distributions tend to carry significant longevity, as it’s expected by the customer base. The average supported enterprise Linux lifespan is 10 years. These distributions also tend to offer an extended timeframe beyond that (for additional fees). This is important to ensure that your team can get access to critical security fixes, even when the community-driven operating systems have ceased supporting their distribution.</p>&#13;
			<p>A great reason why you should consider an enterprise distribution over a free community one is software supply chain security. This is a topic that we will touch upon many times in this book. In March 2024, the highest level CVE was discovered in distributions that are the closest to the upstream developers. <em class="italic">CVE-2024-3094</em> (<a href="https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-3094">https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-3094</a>) is caused by the supply chain of a software package called <strong class="bold">xz</strong> having<a id="_idIndexMarker203"/> had its GitHub repo compromised, where malicious code was injected into the package. This malicious code then interferes with OpenSSH by creating a backdoor into the system.</p>&#13;
			<p>This vulnerability directly compromised hundreds of thousands of systems that run community-based Linux operating systems; however, those customers of enterprise Linux distributions, such as Suse or Red Hat, were unaffected, as their distributions’ supply chains were considered heavily secured and well-tested.</p>&#13;
			<p>As we’re talking about community versus enterprise, I thought it prudent to show you a contrast listing of examples for both. There are actually hundreds of small community distributions out there, but the majority of those most likely to appear in an embedded Linux system appliance are listed here.</p>&#13;
			<p>Here are some examples of good, free-to-use community distributions<a id="_idIndexMarker204"/> that could be used in an embedded appliance:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>Fedora</li>&#13;
				<li>OpenSuse</li>&#13;
				<li>AlmaLinux™</li>&#13;
				<li>Rocky Linux™</li>&#13;
				<li>Ubuntu</li>&#13;
				<li>Debian</li>&#13;
				<li>Arch Linux™</li>&#13;
				<li>Slackware</li>&#13;
				<li>Raspberry Pi® OS</li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>Here are some examples of paid enterprise distributions<a id="_idIndexMarker205"/> that offer greater security, support options, and possibly extended life cycle options:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>Red Hat Enterprise Linux</li>&#13;
				<li>Ubuntu Pro Server</li>&#13;
				<li>Suse Enterprise Linux Server</li>&#13;
				<li>Oracle Enterprise Linux</li>&#13;
				<li>Wind River Linux™</li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>Now that we’ve reviewed a major swath of distributions by listing the more common free/community distributions and contrasted them with the vastly more stable and secure enterprise offerings, I trust that you can see the true attributes in their comparisons. Let’s move on to see how they stand t<a id="_idTextAnchor166"/>he test of time.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-83"><a id="_idTextAnchor167"/>Lifecycle of operating systems versus your solution</h1>&#13;
			<p>Ensuring that<a id="_idIndexMarker206"/> the support window of time for the physical hardware that your solution will be built upon aligns with the support window and availability of the Linux distribution you have chosen is crucial.</p>&#13;
			<p>Changing an operating system on an appliance in the field is an effort in pain and suffering. It’s generally a safe assumption that your support team will not have direct access to any system sold that’s in use by a customer in the field. Unless your offering is supported as a remotely managed service for the end-customer, it’s common for embedded systems to have no communication with the mothership (i.e., its manufacturer), except for those that are allowed to acquire their updates from the vendor automatically online.</p>&#13;
			<p>Changing an operating system is like performing a fresh installation. Generally, we try to keep this out of the end-customers' view, as if they are involved and have access during the process, it can be easily compromised and grant the end-customer access levels that were not intended for them. This puts your solution at risk of having its configuration altered or broken, or levels of access granted to those who are not authorized. Yes, it’s a security problem!</p>&#13;
			<p>So, choose your operating system and hardware wisely. Plan for extensive buffers of time in the support windows of hardware and Linux distribution. If this cannot be aligned completely, ensure that you have a plan to manage upgrades in the future that keep a solution secure, while preventing data loss. Keep the end-customer as far away from this process as possible (wherever feasible). I think you get my poin<a id="_idTextAnchor168"/><a id="_idTextAnchor169"/>t. Let’s move on.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-84"><a id="_idTextAnchor170"/>Hard costs versus soft costs</h1>&#13;
			<p>This discussion might pose a tricky situation for your company, yet it’s a discussion that must take place. This will definitely impact design decisions and future support structures. Ultimately, what you charge for your solution must be reasonably above what it costs to design, build, and support it. I must strongly advise you and your team to work out all cost models extensively in the design phase of your project. Feature creep, training costs, logistics costs, technical debt, delays, research and marketing budgets, and other factors are all deeply in play here. Simply, this ties into security in that if not all costs are planned for beforehand, it’s more than probable you will operate on a fixed budget, and something may not get the attention it fully deserves, thereby creating a situation where maybe something gets overlooked and, in itself, becomes a security vulnerability.</p>&#13;
			<p>Cost models drive everything in the modern world. Profit matters. Finding the balance between minimizing costs and providing the best product possible is a constant challenge that product managers face. It’s up to you to determine what the proper balance is for your product. I beg you to not cut corners on factors that impact your product’s security. Having a true understanding of your labor costs, hardware costs, software costs, and what your research has determined to be the truest sweet spot for your product’s price to the customer will have a great impact on your decision-making. Let’s look at some of those factors in t<a id="_idTextAnchor171"/>he next sections.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-85"><a id="_idTextAnchor172"/>Hardware costs</h2>&#13;
			<p>These costs may be the easiest<a id="_idIndexMarker207"/> to account for yet the largest expenditure for your project. These go beyond the platform you have chosen as well. You may need to build out a whole new toolchain in order to build and support your appliances. I encourage you and your team to ensure that you plan for a decent reserve of systems, keeping them on hand for testing and troubleshooting.</p>&#13;
			<p>As mentioned in the previous chapter, custom hardware has additional costs. These are not just monetary but can also apply to how much time is spent. Custom hardware takes longer to design and prototype; moreover, it often requires substantially more testing. If you plan on utilizing an enterprise Linux distribution, the company that provides it may require you to certify your hardware for compatibility with their platform. Failure to account for that may also result in the hardware solution not being supportable by the operating system’s vendor. This can create problems down the road for your company, either perceived or actual.</p>&#13;
			<p>I understand that the drive to cut costs in any organization is paramount, but I feel compelled to encourage you to account for and acquire sufficient resources to maintain a group of systems for future developments, and to troubleshoot any possible future end-customer issues. Testing directly impacts the quality and, yes, the security of your product. Don’t skimp on testing.</p>&#13;
			<p>Let’s move <a id="_idTextAnchor173"/>on to other costs.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-86"><a id="_idTextAnchor174"/>Software costs</h2>&#13;
			<p>Just like with planning for<a id="_idIndexMarker208"/> hardware costs, planning for your team’s software needs is no less important. This goes beyond simple operating system costs for the product itself, as it extends to every aspect of designing, building, and supporting your appliance solution. All software must be accounted for – operating systems, applications, source code control systems, automation systems, security scanning systems, backup and recovery systems, and so on.</p>&#13;
			<p>Partnering with your software vendors can greatly assist in reducing costs. Additionally, such partnering may be required in order to legally utilize their product as part of your own. These partner programs generally also have a cost of membership, whether it is a program fee, minimum purchase requirement, or requirement to maintain a subscription to so<a id="_idTextAnchor175"/>ftware or services.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-87"><a id="_idTextAnchor176"/>Soft costs</h2>&#13;
			<p>Soft costs are the <a id="_idIndexMarker209"/>creeping death of any project, as they can be difficult to account for or forecast. While hard costs refer to materials, hardware, and software, soft costs are generally related to your staff. More specifically, this is impacted by what skill sets they currently have versus what they need to design, build, and then support your desired appliance solution.</p>&#13;
			<p>These needs may not be apparent when your design team prototypes the appliance. It’s quite possible for there to be knowledge gaps between those designing/building the embedded Linux systems and the teams tasked with providing the customer support services. These gaps must be filled with training and knowledge transfer.</p>&#13;
			<p>Not addressing these knowledge gaps can cause many problems. What if your design team is not familiar with the targeted platform, or even worse, its chosen operating system? This leaves the end design open to possibly countless vulnerabilities that, in this case, may not have been thought about. Additionally, failure to address any gaps in the skills required to put forward the best product will ultimately induce technical debt that in itself is a security risk.</p>&#13;
			<p>It is best to fill these gaps with training or, in a worst-case scenario, with new hires or consultants who can ramp up the rest of the product and support teams. Regardless of where the knowledge gaps reside (e.g., hardware, configuration, operating system, or general usage), it becomes a security challenge if not addressed.</p>&#13;
			<p>Okay, I’m done beating this subject to death. I trust it was not too painful. Granted, I do acknowledge that I can sometimes appear overly dramatic when I want to ram a point home. But let’s not underestimate the true value of just how many skills each team member brings to the design table and beyond it. Not bringing your <em class="italic">A-game</em> has a negative impact. Let’s move onward.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-88"><a id="_idTextAnchor177"/>Summary</h1>&#13;
			<p>All we have reviewed thus far has been leading up to this moment. In the past four chapters, we have covered a wealth of factors that impact design criteria, wrapping all that up in this chapter with the Linux operating system that is to be the foundation of your applications within your solutions.</p>&#13;
			<p>The lessons that you have learned from this chapter are complex. There are many great Linux distributions and companies out there. Each of their distributions or, in some cases, their custom spins, which are variants of their distributions, target specific hardware platforms or end-user use cases. These use cases can range from custom graphical interfaces to industrial control management, from artificial intelligence-driven analytics to advanced security policy enforcement.</p>&#13;
			<p>We have covered a lot in this chapter, so let’s summarize some of the points you need to remember. Your hardware selection will totally empower or limit you in terms of the Linux distributions you choose. Within the vast galaxy of Linux distributions, hopefully, you now have a better understanding of the differences between free community distributions versus the stable and secure, paid-for enterprise offerings. You should also understand how the life cycle of your hardware and software selections can empower or limit your solution. Finally, your team should also understand the overall cost model relative to the decisions you have made. Altogether, this forms the basis of your architectural plan for your product.</p>&#13;
			<p>Now, it’s time to put what you have learned to the test. We’ll move on to our next chapter, which will contain practical exercises for setting up your build chain, tooling, and implementing some of the technologies we mentioned earlier, along with some things that may be new to you.</p>&#13;
