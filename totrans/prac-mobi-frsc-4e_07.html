<p>An examiner like you must not only know how to use forensic tools but must also understand the methods and acquisition techniques that are deployed by the tools you use in your investigations. Apart from saving time, forensic tools also make the process of forensic analysis a lot easier. However, each tool has its flaws. You must catch any mistakes and know how to correct them by leveraging another tool or technique. It's impossible for a tool to support all devices. You are responsible for learning and using the best tools to complete the job. As we discussed in the previous chapters, you must understand how data is stored on iOS devices to ensure that the tool is capturing all the accessible data.</p>
<p>Currently, there are a number of commercial tools, such as Cellebrite UFED Physical Analyzer, BlackBag BlackLight, Oxygen Forensic Detective, Belkasoft Evidence Center, MSAB XRY, Magnet AXIOM, and others, which are available for the forensic acquisition and analysis of iOS devices. For familiarity purposes, this chapter will walk you through the usage of a few of them and provide details on the steps required to perform acquisitions and the analysis of iOS devices.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Working with Cellebrite UFED Physical Analyzer</li>
<li>Working with Magnet AXIOM</li>
<li>Working with Belkasoft Evidence Center</li>
<li>Working with Elcomsoft Phone Viewer</li>
</ul>

<p>As we mentioned previously, Physical Analyzer can be used not only for parsing different types of forensic artifacts from acquired images but also for performing both logical and filesystem (and even physical, for older devices) types of extraction from iOS devices. Due to the fact that physical acquisition is actually only for older devices, the best option is an <span>advanced logical acquisition. </span></p>
<p>We are going to acquire and analyze data from an iPhone running iOS 13.2.3. Let's get started:</p>
<ol>
<li>Connect the device through the appropriate cable to your workstation. Make sure it's trusted and launch the <span>Physical Analyzer.</span> </li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>Go to <span class="packt_screen">Extract</span> | <span class="packt_screen">iOS Device Extraction</span>. The <span class="packt_screen">iOS Device Data Extraction Wizard</span> window will pop up:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/d760b426-7dc8-4a85-ab3c-de0df8d180bb.png" style="width:37.08em;height:20.25em;"/></p>
<div class="mce-root CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Choosing an extraction type</div>
<ol start="3">
<li>Since we are dealing with a modern iOS device, let's choose <span class="packt_screen">Advanced Logical extraction</span>. If the device is recognized, you'll see the device's name, its UDID, and also its iOS version:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/dece4869-de70-4a76-8ec5-c90ceb61be1e.png" style="width:48.67em;height:29.92em;"/></p>
<div class="mce-root CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Connecting the device</div>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">In our case, the iPhone's iTunes backup is protected with a known password, so the best method is <span class="packt_screen">Method 1</span>:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/8d6fed72-ad97-4294-80b6-d7636f0b2ce1.png" style="width:36.83em;height:19.00em;"/></p>
<div class="mce-root CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Choosing an extraction method</div>
<ol start="4">
<li>If you want the backup to be encrypted (recommended), you can choose this option on the next page:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/343de65a-4131-4ca3-978d-64d2546687ae.png" style="width:36.42em;height:19.92em;"/></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Choosing whether the backup should be encrypted or not</div>
<ol start="5">
<li>It's time to choose where the data will be saved; in our case, it's the root of the <kbd>D:\</kbd> drive:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/57eb13be-1d34-46b3-a744-e73b3e7d5a93.png" style="width:33.33em;height:19.58em;"/></p>
<div class="mce-root CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Choosing where to save the extraction</div>
<ol start="5">
<li>Now, the acquisition process will start. Make sure the device is connected until the end of the process:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/57e9cbfc-6be3-4c86-86c6-78ce1c699fbc.png" style="width:36.00em;height:19.58em;"/></p>
<div class="mce-root CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Extracting the data</div>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Once the extraction process has finished, the extracted data will be parsed with powerful Physical Analyzer plugins. As a result, you will get a set of artifacts divided into a number of categories:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/94edba14-72bb-4366-b38b-a151fa0c3acd.png" style="width:34.42em;height:22.42em;"/></p>
<div class="mce-root CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Phone data extracted and parsed by Physical Analyzer</div>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">The same can be said about the data files:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/9aa33e2e-747a-4a7d-a73f-7e4d873bdf78.png" style="width:38.17em;height:9.25em;"/></p>
<div class="mce-root CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref"><span>Data files extracted by Physical Analyzer</span></div>
<p>As you may have already noticed, there are red numbers in brackets <span>– </span>these are deleted records that have been recovered by Physical Analyzer's plugins. As you already know, it's not a miracle that deleted data can be recovered from SQLite databases, which are widely used in iOS. </p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>Talking about SQLite databases, there is another amazing feature of Physical Analyzer that might be useful for adding custom artifacts to your mobile forensics reports and parsing unknown apps data <span>– </span>the SQLite wizard. You can find it under <span class="packt_screen">Tools</span> | <span class="packt_screen">SQLite wizard</span>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Let's start by choosing a database. Of course, it's good to choose an app that isn't parsed by Physical Analyzer automatically. In our example, this is an app called <span class="packt_screen">Scan</span>:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/97bd5ad7-0eec-41fa-9531-025ab7a00a03.png" style="width:55.50em;height:29.17em;"/></p>
<div class="mce-root CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Selecting a database</div>
<ol start="2">
<li>Make sure you have selected the <span class="packt_screen">Include deleted rows</span> option; this will help you recover data automatically but, of course, it will increase the number of false positive records:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/2824e656-f6df-40c1-8992-e17ba433ab04.png" style="width:45.25em;height:29.08em;"/></p>
<div class="mce-root CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Starting the SQLite wizard</div>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">So, our app is used for scanning QR codes and contains four columns of interest <span>– </span>the scan date and time, latitude, longitude, and scan result. All of the rows are part of <kbd>ZSCSCANEVENT</kbd>:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/ac215964-177a-4951-bf26-97457a0e3838.png" style="width:42.08em;height:24.33em;"/></p>
<div class="mce-root CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Choosing database tables and columns</div>
<ol start="3">
<li>The next step is selecting the timestamp. You've already learned quite a bit about iOS timestamps and should recognize the format in <kbd>ZTIMELESSCREATIONDATE</kbd>, but even if you don't, the SQLite wizard does this for you:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/09b0f770-2836-49f8-bd4c-1562252624ae.png" style="width:25.25em;height:20.75em;"/></p>
<div class="mce-root CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Selecting the timestamp format</div>
<ol start="4">
<li>The generic model will suit any database, but there are some existing Physical Analyzer models that can be used for typical content, such as <em>Chats</em> or <em>Contacts</em>. In our case, we are using the generic model:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/728b0766-f96b-475a-ab3e-7b9f93396684.png" style="width:68.08em;height:32.58em;"/></p>
<div class="mce-root CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Choosing the model</div>
<p>Once you've chosen the model and field types for the column, you can run the query and add the new parsed artifacts to your extraction and, afterward, to your report.</p>

<p class="mce-root">Magnet AXIOM is one of the most useful digital forensics tools on the market. It can be used for both computer and mobile forensics; the recent version of the suite introduced the newest feature <span>– </span>cloud forensics. As for iOS forensics, it can be used both for logical and filesystem acquisitions and supports all iOS versions <span>– </span>from the oldest to the latest. Of course, it can also be used for parsing iTunes backups and physical images created by third-party tools such as Elcomsoft iOS Forensic Toolkit.</p>
<p>One of the best features of Magnet AXIOM is its ability to start processing extraction data on the fly so that you don't have to wait for the acquisition process to be finished to start your forensic analysis.</p>

<p>As you may recall, the most common acquisition for modern iOS devices is a logical type. Here is how you would acquire an iOS device with Magnet AXIOM:</p>
<ol>
<li>Start by creating a new case:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/c5d1fbc9-8565-42dc-97e4-f002ab701a43.png" style="width:46.25em;height:30.08em;"/></p>
<div class="mce-root CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Creating a new case</div>

<div class="mce-root CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref"><span>Selecting the evidence source</span></div>
<ol start="4">
<li>There are three options for acquiring evidence <span>– </span>we can choose an already acquired image (for example, a iTunes backup or a filesystem image acquired by a third-party tool), extract data from the device, or use GrayKey for acquisition. Let's choose the second option:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/1fdfa17f-8d00-4697-bf4b-6be439edad46.png" style="width:25.92em;height:11.83em;"/></p>

<ol start="9">
<li>You can customize <span class="packt_screen">MOBILE ARTIFACTS</span> from here. For example, if you are only interested in chats artifacts, it's better to choose only these types of artifacts as they will shorten the processing time:</li>

<li>There are two windows for Magnet AXIOM <span>–</span> <span class="packt_screen">Process</span> and <span class="packt_screen">Examine</span>. The first can be used to monitor the process of acquiring and processing the evidence source, while the second can be used to analyze the extracted and parsed data. As we mentioned previously, you can start the analysis before the processing phase has ended. All you need to do is click on <span class="packt_screen">LOAD NEW RESULTS</span> in <span class="packt_screen">Magnet Examine</span>:</li>

<p>Since backup processing and analysis is one of the best features of <span>Belkasoft Evidence Center, we are going to walk you through this process here:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>Let's start by creating a new case:</li>
</ol>

<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Creating a new case</div>
<ol start="2">
<li>There are multiple options here <span>– </span>you can process a previously acquired image, such as an iTunes backup, or choose to extract data from a device first. Let's start with logical acquisition. Choose the <span class="packt_screen">Mobile</span> option:</li>
</ol>

<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Choosing the acquisition method</div>
<ol start="5">
<li>Once acquisition has been completed, you can choose artifacts of interest. Make sure you choose only iOS-related artifacts; this will decrease the processing time:</li>

<p>Elcomsoft Phone Viewer doesn't support device acquisition but can parse and help you view data that has been extracted with Elcomsoft iOS Forensic Toolkit, Elcomsoft Cloud eXtractor, or almost any other tool capable of iOS device acquisition.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>To explore a filesystem image that was previously created with <span>Elcomsoft iOS Forensic Toolkit</span>, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Launch Elcomsoft Phone Viewer and choose the appropriate data source. In our case, this is <span class="packt_screen">iOS device image</span>:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/4e3e89dc-52aa-4480-b1b3-2623253f9e8d.png" style="width:28.33em;height:19.33em;"/></p>
<div class="packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">Choosing data source</div>
<ol start="2">
<li>Choose the file you want to import and the artifact you want to parse:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/f5eb285a-2f96-4873-9400-b3da4f144885.png" style="width:35.50em;height:14.92em;"/></p>
<div class="packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">Choosing data types</div>
<ol start="3">
<li>Wait for the extraction process to finish:</li>

<div class="packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">Extraction process</div>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">As a result, you'll get the device's information, as well as the parsed artifacts split into multiple categories:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/4cea1620-5a95-4f4f-8318-9b4166f643e8.png" style="width:34.42em;height:17.42em;"/></p>
<div class="packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">Parsed artifacts</div>
<p>Now, you can easily view, filter, and export any data that may be of interest for your examination <span>–</span> all you need to do is click on the corresponding icon.</p>

<p>Forensic tools are helpful for an examiner as they not only save time but also make the process a lot easier. However, not everyone has a budget large enough to purchase commercial tools to obtain iOS acquisition. While free tools exist for acquisition, support may be limited and multiple extractions may be required to obtain the same amount of data as a commercial tool.</p>
<p>For jailbroken devices, the iOS device can be connected to a forensic workstation for live examination through SSH, which is how some of the tools acquire the necessary data. However, this is not a method that is recommended for those new to mobile forensics. For such purposes, this chapter introduced you to several available iOS forensic tools and included the steps you need to follow to perform acquisition and analysis.</p>
<p>You should take further steps to validate and understand each tool that might be used as part of an investigation. We recommend that you acquire test devices with known data to ensure that nothing is overlooked, the evidence hasn't been altered, and that the methods provide you with access to the data of interest, where possible.</p>
<p>The next chapter will introduce Android forensics and cover the fundamental concepts of the Android platform.</p>
