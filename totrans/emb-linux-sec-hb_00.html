			<h1 id="_idParaDest-7"><a id="_idTextAnchor006"/>Preface</h1>&#13;
			<p>Welcome to <em class="italic">The Embedded Linux Security Handbook</em>. Together, we’ll be embarking on a journey of knowledge – a deep exploration of what is considered (by many) tribal knowledge. This is the kind of stuff you cannot find online. My purpose for writing this book is to share my vast knowledge of applying security and best practices to the creation of Linux appliances.</p>&#13;
			<p>Security doesn’t end with a few configurations. It’s perpetual knowledge and evolution mixed with a healthy dose of preparation and vigilance.</p>&#13;
			<p>This book will take you on a hands-on journey of how and when to apply best practices and access public and private security resources, as well as the often-complex application of security measures throughout the myriad tasks required to create a secure and supportable Linux-based appliance solution.</p>&#13;
			<p>By the end of this journey, you’ll be best positioned to design, prototype, build, and support embedded Linux systems (and products) like never before. So, grab your favorite beverage and a notebook, and let’s get moving.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-8"><a id="_idTextAnchor007"/>Who this book is for</h1>&#13;
			<p>Although this book should appeal to a wide range of technologists, those who will get the most out of what I am presenting here are product teams, embedded software engineers, security professionals, and architects – more specifically, those who are directly or indirectly involved with the scoping, design, creation, and supporting of embedded Linux systems appliances.</p>&#13;

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-10"><a id="_idTextAnchor009"/>To get the most out of this book</h1>&#13;
			<p>In order to get the most out of this book, it is assumed that the reader has some prior experience in Linux systems administration or experience as a user of Linux systems.</p>&#13;
			<p>Many of the concepts in this book are extremely advanced. The lessons in this book combined with your existing knowledge should catapult you to a level of mastery of not only understanding the internals of Linux systems but also building products based upon Linux.</p>&#13;
			<p>There are numerous hands-on exercises in this book to enhance the learning activities. Should you choose to follow along with these exercises, the author recommends having at least two PC-grade systems with a minimum of 16 GB of RAM and 1 TB of storage each for best results.</p>&#13;
			<p>Additionally, this book contains several screenshots. These have been captured to provide an overview of key processes. As a result, the text in these images may appear small at 100% zoom.
