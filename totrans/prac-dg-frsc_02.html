Doing so will provide a sound basis for understanding the nature of digital evidence and its value to the practitioner. The nature of digital evidence will be touched upon in this chapter but will be described in greater detail in <a class="link" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. The Nature and Special Properties of Digital Evidence">Chapter 3</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>The Nature and Special Properties of Digital Evidence</em></span>.</p><p>This chapter will describe and explain the basic workings of computer hardware and the operating systems and applications typically installed on them. It will describe how these environments are used to create, store, and transfer electronic data. An insight is provided into the workings of computers and storage devices and the location of datasets where digital evidence may be located.</p><p>The topics covered in this chapter will:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Detail the wide variety of computers and storage devices and the nature of digital information they hold of potential evidentiary value</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Describe operating system software and applications used in the creation, transfer, and storage of electronic information</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Identify and explain filesystems and files that contain evidence of evidentiary value and where they are typically located on devices</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Explain password security and encryption used to protect information and conceal evidence</li></ul></div><div class="section" title="Describing computers and the nature of digital information"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl1sec17"/>Describing computers and the nature of digital information</h1></div></div></div><p>Digital evidence comprises <a id="id60" class="indexterm"/>digital information found on a broad range of electronic devices, and it is generally considered by practitioners to consist of only the information held in digital data format that is useful to the forensic examiner because of its value in various legal proceedings. Sources of potential evidence stored on digital devices include e-mails, audio and video files, electronic documents, spreadsheets, databases, system logs, and filesystem data.</p><div class="section" title="Magnetic hard drives and tapes"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec26"/>Magnetic hard drives and tapes</h2></div></div></div><p>Information <a id="id61" class="indexterm"/>containing potential evidence is<a id="id62" class="indexterm"/> located in files stored on hard drives, memory<a id="id63" class="indexterm"/> cards, access control devices such as smart cards, biometric <a id="id64" class="indexterm"/>scanners, answering machines, digital cameras, personal digital assistants, electronic organizers, printers, removable storage devices, and media such as CD-ROM and DVD discs, telephones, copiers, credit card skimmers, digital watches, facsimile machines, and global positioning systems.</p><p>The primary storage devices used for digital information until the beginning of the century were magnetic discs, floppy drives, and tape drives. Magnetic tapes and disks store digital data in binary form, that is, as 1s and 0s, as magnetic data on the surface of metal platters. Magnetic disks rotate these magnetized platters at high speed close to an electromagnetic read/write device, which enables selected portions of the surface to be read from or written to with a moveable arm. Magnetic tapes, on the other hand, can only be accessed in sequential order by playing the tape forward or backward. Both processes are still the predominant source of storage devices to date. For the time being, they are of paramount importance in reconstructing the activities of users relating to some transgression under investigation.</p><p>Hard disk drive technology emerged in the 1950s and was the predominant form of primary digital storage. The data is saved permanently and persists on the storage device unless later removed, destroyed, or lost through some physical deterioration of the device. This type of memory is<a id="id65" class="indexterm"/> termed <span class="strong"><strong>non-volatile memory</strong></span>. The simple and consistent design of these devices has been advantageous to forensics practitioners using well-established processes such as dead analysis and forensic tools such as write blockers to recover evidence.</p><p>The last few decades have been a golden era for digital evidence, as evidence stored on magnetic hard discs is inconvenient to expunge permanently (<span class="emphasis"><em>Bell and Boddington 2010</em></span>). However, the advent<a id="id66" class="indexterm"/> of <span class="strong"><strong>Solid-State Drives</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>SSDs</strong></span>), outlined shortly, is taking over control of the market, especially in relation to smaller data stores on handheld devices.</p></div><div class="section" title="Optical media storage devices"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec27"/>Optical media storage devices</h2></div></div></div><p>CDs, DVDs, and Blu-ray discs are optical storage media that are relatively inexpensive and are<a id="id67" class="indexterm"/> capable of read-only bulk storage. These<a id="id68" class="indexterm"/> media rely on the physical interference of light waves reflecting off miniature dips and plateaus on the reflective surface of the disc. A laser burner is used to burn the disc surface, which is relatively slow and inconvenient. The disc surface may deteriorate, requiring some form of protection before use. The data embedded on these media is also non-volatile and, generally, what has been written to the media is recoverable in theory.</p></div><div class="section" title="Random-access memory (RAM)"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec28"/>Random-access memory (RAM)</h2></div></div></div><p>The central <a id="id69" class="indexterm"/>memory core of most <a id="id70" class="indexterm"/>computers, usually called <span class="strong"><strong>RAM</strong></span>, is also a binary-based system that is stored and processed in the <span class="strong"><strong>Central Processing Unit</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>CPU</strong></span>) on<a id="id71" class="indexterm"/> a large array of tiny, battery-like capacitors. These memory cells or capacitors are filled selectively with electric charges, using which data can be written and read back out again. The capacitors cannot store charge permanently or for long periods. By necessity, they have to be read out regularly and automatically and the memory recharged to prevent data loss.</p><p>Unlike the non-volatile data stored on hard drives, tape drives, and optical devices, such memory is termed volatile or dynamic RAM. It is not used for long-term storage of data because the constant refreshing process requires a continual source of electrical power. The instant the device is powered down, the memory stored in the RAM quickly dissipates.</p><p>Capturing RAM may be important as it provides details of the most recent use of the device and includes some keyboard activity. However, capturing the RAM's contents while the device is powered up might result in the practitioner overwriting and contaminating the memory in RAM as well as on the hard drive. Several forensic processes for capturing RAM will be described in <a class="link" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Recovering and Preserving Digital Evidence">Chapter 4</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Recovering and Preserving Digital Evidence</em></span>. Powering down a device such as a laptop or a mobile phone may make it impossible to regain access to the device if it is password protected and encrypted.</p><p>Forensics practitioners have well-established processes for examining magnetic disc storage devices such as IDE, SATA, and SCSI drives. However, new-technology storage systems based on complex, transistor-based devices are becoming increasingly common. For example, during the past 10 years, there has been a transition from portable magnetic floppy discs to USB transistor flash or thumb drives.</p></div><div class="section" title="Solid-state drive (SSD) storage devices"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec29"/>Solid-state drive (SSD) storage devices</h2></div></div></div><p>SSDs are<a id="id72" class="indexterm"/> faster and more <a id="id73" class="indexterm"/>complex than conventional USB flash drives or thumb drives. The technology behind SSDs is as old as magnetic disks, but they have only recently emerged as faster, lighter, and physically more robust than magnetic drives. The popularity and demand for USB flash drives has resulted in cheaper and larger devices becoming available.</p><p>However, SSD technology, which is transistor-based, is slowly replacing magnetic hard drives, is complex, and stores data differently. These devices are expensive compared with magnetic drives and typically are available in sizes from 250 gigabytes up to 1 terabyte. They have generally been regarded as fast but with a shorter life span than magnetics, although new models are proving to be more reliable and longer lasting.</p><p>SSDs typically store data in 512-kilobyte blocks, subdivided into pages composed of large arrays of <span class="strong"><strong>Negative AND</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>NAND</strong></span>) transistors, which are similar to the logic chips used to build<a id="id74" class="indexterm"/> computer processors mentioned previously. Because of the nature of SSDs, they do need to "house clean" their storage to maintain fast processing and reduce the overuse of transistors, which would significantly reduce the life of the drive. Consequently, they may erase deleted data automatically, thereby thwarting forensic recovery (<span class="emphasis"><em>Bell and Boddington 2010</em></span>).</p></div><div class="section" title="Network-stored data"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec30"/>Network-stored data</h2></div></div></div><p>In the<a id="id75" class="indexterm"/> case of data stored on computer network servers, access may be provided by connecting a device to the network and the practitioner <a id="id76" class="indexterm"/>being provided with authentication details. Less common is for external connections to the network to be used to access and image datasets for later analysis. This is a typical scenario for e-discovery and serious crimes such as fraud and network misuse.</p><p>It may often be desirable to make physical images of network servers rather than recovering the logical data provided by the operating system. An organization's ability to make the physical device available for acquiring the data makes this a challenging possibility in addition to the practical implications, such as ensuring that the effect on the organization's normal activities is minimized. This challenge is described in detail in <a class="link" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. The Need for Enhanced Forensic Tools">Chapter 5</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>The Need for Enhanced Forensic Tools</em></span>.</p></div><div class="section" title="The cloud"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec31"/>The cloud</h2></div></div></div><p>Internet-based<a id="id77" class="indexterm"/> computing that shares resources and information has<a id="id78" class="indexterm"/> become a popular network feature used by individuals, organizations, and government agencies. Commonly referred to as the cloud, it is used for online communications and to store large amounts of data, much of it of a private or confidential nature. The next figure shows a typical cloud network: a convenient point of storage for employees working away from the office to access and store data for others to access and use. Finding evidence in larger datasets dispersed over networks is proving problematic for conventional recovery tools. <a class="link" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. The Need for Enhanced Forensic Tools">Chapter 5</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>The Need for Enhanced Forensic Tools</em></span>, describes solutions that offer better outcomes for practitioners:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/4931_02_01.jpg" alt="The cloud"/><div class="caption"><p>A typical cloud network</p></div></div><p>Acquiring<a id="id79" class="indexterm"/> evidence from the cloud is different and more challenging<a id="id80" class="indexterm"/> than recovering data from a network, because the data is stored on a device distinct from the device used to recover the data. Access to a cloud network is usually through the normal consumer access process to the resource, often owned by another entity. One of the challenges in recovering data is difficulty in identifying the path that the data takes from the cloud server to the storage device, which may not be a fixed route (<span class="emphasis"><em>Adams 2013</em></span>).</p><p>Because the cloud consumers who own the data do not have physical control of the network servers storing the data, the process of obtaining a physical forensic image of the actual storage device is complicated; it is often unfeasible to do so. The network server may be located in one or more locations in different legal jurisdictions. This may often require travel and requests from the network operators to recover data, which is not always guaranteed (<span class="emphasis"><em>Adams 2013</em></span>).</p><p>Another problem facing the practitioner arises when the network server running on the host resource is likely to be an instance of a virtual machine, which is also likely to be one of many on the same physical device. To acquire all the data, including deleted material and free space where non-erased information may be located, will require a copy of the virtual machine facilitated by someone with access to the server. This, too, raises problems with a third party being unwilling or having little incentive to assist in data recovery and possibly contaminating any evidence (<span class="emphasis"><em>Adams 2013</em></span>).</p></div></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Operating systems"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl1sec18"/>Operating systems</h1></div></div></div><p>An operating system is a set of programs controlling access between devices, including the keyboard, mouse, monitor, disk drive, and network devices, and application software programs <a id="id81" class="indexterm"/>such as word processors and browsers. You will be familiar with the range of Windows operating systems from Windows 1.0, released in 1985, through to the current version, Windows 10, released in 2015.</p><p>There are, of course, a range of other operating platforms that meet different user requirements, including Ubuntu, FreeBSD, Linux, iCloud, Palm OS, Blackberry OS, Xbox 360 OS, Android, and the Apple range of computers and handheld devices. This screenshot is from a typical Windows 10 operating system:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/4931_02_02.jpg" alt="Operating systems"/><div class="caption"><p>Windows 10 operating system</p></div></div><div class="section" title="Connecting the software application to the operating system"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec32"/>Connecting the software application to the operating system</h2></div></div></div><p>To use a <a id="id82" class="indexterm"/>software application such as<a id="id83" class="indexterm"/> Paintshop requires it to be installed on a compatible operating system, such as Windows. By using the application, the user can create a picture and save it for further use, including modifying, deleting, and transferring the picture to another medium or through some communication process such as e-mailing it or uploading to the Internet. The following figure depicts the basic process of creating a picture image <a id="id84" class="indexterm"/>using Paintshop, in which the operating system allows the picture being created to be displayed on the computer monitor. The picture may be modified through the keyboard and other peripheral devices to be saved, transferred through the Internet, or printed:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/4931_02_03.jpg" alt="Connecting the software application to the operating system"/><div class="caption"><p>Producing a picture in Paintshop</p></div></div><p>The file is<a id="id85" class="indexterm"/> saved on the device in the <a id="id86" class="indexterm"/>creation, modification, and deletion processes, and it may later be recovered to see whether it could have some evidentiary value. The file leaves other records on the device, which, if recoverable, may also provide the practitioner with useful insight into its history.</p></div><div class="section" title="Connecting the software application to the operating system and a device"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec33"/>Connecting the software application to the operating system and a device</h2></div></div></div><p>If a <a id="id87" class="indexterm"/>device is connected <a id="id88" class="indexterm"/>to a computer<a id="id89" class="indexterm"/> device such as a scanner, special software must be installed to allow the device to connect to the operating system, which then facilitates the use of the device by the appropriate software application. This is achieved by device drivers—small programs used by an operating system to communicate with the attached device. The driver is designed to recognize a device's command language and characteristics.</p><p>Drivers are usually preinstalled on the device for convenient connection to peripheral devices such as monitors, keyboards, mice, and printers. A newer-model printer, for example, may prompt the device to download a new or updated driver through the Internet site associated with the printer or with software supplied with the printer. The following figure shows the use of a keyboard connected to a computer and enabled by the operating system to create a text document that may be viewed on a monitor:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/4931_02_04.jpg" alt="Connecting the software application to the operating system and a device"/><div class="caption"><p>Word document creation</p></div></div></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Describing filesystems that contain evidence"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl1sec19"/>Describing filesystems that contain evidence</h1></div></div></div><p>The way file information is stored varies among different operating systems. In the interest of clarity, they will be presented in the setting of the Windows filesystem environment, which is the most widely used operating system at present. However, <a class="link" href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. Windows and Other Operating Systems as Sources of Evidence">Chapter 7</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Windows and Other Operating Systems as Sources of Evidence</em></span>, describes other operating systems in more detail and the files and filesystems they use. Files themselves may be looked at from different perspectives, and the way Windows catalogs them is a <a id="id90" class="indexterm"/>benefit to forensic examination.</p><p>Commands received from the operating system in order to read and write files are interpreted in a directory structure, incorporating a file index system that defines file naming protocols and the maximum size of the file. Microsoft operating systems manage these <a id="id91" class="indexterm"/>records in a <span class="strong"><strong>Master File Table</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>MFT</strong></span>), where information is cataloged for every file and directory. The table is essentially a relational database table, containing various attributes about all the stored file records. For example, when an MS Word document is created and saved, it will be stored in a selected location, and timestamps will be created to record the process and the subsequent use of the file.</p><p>The value of timestamps and other file metadata will be highlighted in later chapters to demonstrate their importance in event reconstruction. This figure shows the process of storing data to a particular sector or sectors on a magnetic platter of a hard drive and its cataloging by the MFT:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/4931_02_05.jpg" alt="Describing filesystems that contain evidence"/><div class="caption"><p>Storing data to a magnetic disc</p></div></div><p>Data is <a id="id92" class="indexterm"/>written to a file in the example in the next figure—a simplified representation of the process of writing four text documents to a hard drive platter:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/4931_02_06.jpg" alt="Describing filesystems that contain evidence"/><div class="caption"><p>Writing files to a hard drive</p></div></div><p>The next figure represents the process of reading files from a hard drive. These files may be deleted and modified on the hard drive, which leaves metadata about these events of possible<a id="id93" class="indexterm"/> future <a id="id94" class="indexterm"/>value to the practitioner:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/4931_02_07.jpg" alt="Describing filesystems that contain evidence"/><div class="caption"><p>Data is read from the file stored on the platter</p></div></div><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note05"/>Note</h3><p>Metadata<a id="id95" class="indexterm"/> is data about data; it describes various properties of a file, including the timestamp, location, creation date, date modified, last accessed date, and, sometimes, deletion dates.</p></div></div><p>The following sections describe the different categories Windows catalogs files into and outlines their value to the practitioner.</p><div class="section" title="The filesystem category"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec34"/>The filesystem category</h2></div></div></div><p>The<a id="id96" class="indexterm"/> filesystem category records the general filesystem information, which, while following a general design, is a unique structure on each individual<a id="id97" class="indexterm"/> device. By cataloging this data, the filesystem category shows users where to find the data and files they are seeking as well as acting as a map for the filesystem (<span class="emphasis"><em>Carrier 2005</em></span>). It brings order to chaos and allows sound storage and retrieval of files for users.</p><p>There is also a benefit of the filesystem, which is rich in file metadata, to practitioners. Filesystem metadata forms an essential part of practitioners' navigation and the examination of filesystem information. It can assist greatly in reconstructing events of relevance to a case (<span class="emphasis"><em>Carrier 2005</em></span>).</p><p>However, if any of this data is corrupted or lost, then additional analysis is made more difficult<a id="id98" class="indexterm"/> because backup copies of the data and records will be<a id="id99" class="indexterm"/> required. Otherwise, the practitioner will need to guess what the original values were and guess the type of application that created the filesystem and the creation date of the file or folder.</p></div><div class="section" title="The filename category"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec35"/>The filename category</h2></div></div></div><p>The <a id="id100" class="indexterm"/>filename category, sometimes referred to as the human interface category, catalogs data used to assign a name to each file. It consists of directory<a id="id101" class="indexterm"/> lists of filenames with the corresponding metadata address of each file. Deleted filenames and their corresponding metadata addresses are used to recover the file content using metadata-based recovery (<span class="emphasis"><em>Carrier 2005</em></span>).</p><p>Being able to use filename listings is a fundamental part of forensic examinations as it allows the practitioner to identify the names of the files and parent directories and can be used for searching for evidence based on filename, path, or file extension. A file extension identifies the type of file, such as a system file or, in the case of an MS Word document, a file denoted by the <code class="literal">.docx</code> extension.</p><p>However, if the metadata address is cleared during file deletion, it may not be possible to locate further information. If only part of a filename is known, it is still possible to search using that part, such as in the case of the file extension or name being known, but not its full path. Metadata is stored in fixed-length tables with its own address. When a file is deleted, the metadata entry is changed to the unallocated state, and the operating system may wipe some of the file values. It should also be noted that file-wiping tools may delete filenames and metadata addresses or overwrite key values in the filename, showing that an entry existed before being invalidated (<span class="emphasis"><em>Carrier 2005</em></span>).</p><p>The operating system stores all file data and metadata in binary form, which is translated to human-readable text or images through the application interface, often referred to as the <a id="id102" class="indexterm"/>
<span class="strong"><strong>Graphical User Interface</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>GUI</strong></span>). This figure shows the filename data saved in binary form and the timestamp metadata:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/4931_02_08.jpg" alt="The filename category"/><div class="caption"><p>Filename information schema</p></div></div></div><div class="section" title="The metadata category"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec36"/>The metadata category</h2></div></div></div><p>The <a id="id103" class="indexterm"/>metadata category contains data that describes the <a id="id104" class="indexterm"/>properties or attributes of a file, displaying the file location and size. Most importantly, it provides a history of the file, providing timestamps for its creation, modification, and access. However, by itself, it does not record the contents of the file nor its name, unlike the file and content categories (<span class="emphasis"><em>Carrier 2005</em></span>).</p><p>Analysis centers on finding more details about a specific file or searching for a file that meets certain requirements. The category contains much non-essential data and can be modified by the operating system, which can make changes to some of the metadata, such as file access times. This may provide some misleading metadata.</p><p>Metadata-based recovery may be required to look for that missing or elusive file and is used when metadata from the deleted file has not been erased. The file may have been relocated, such as being moved from one folder to another. This may prove problematic to detect as it is not uncommon when a file has been reallocated to recover two or more unallocated metadata entries that have the same file address.</p><p>Examination of metadata may assist when viewing file contents and searching for file values as well as locating deleted files. It is usually initiated when a filename points to a specific metadata structure and file examination is required (<span class="emphasis"><em>Carrier 2005</em></span>).</p><p>The <a id="id105" class="indexterm"/>following figure shows metadata recovered from a thumbnail <a id="id106" class="indexterm"/>of a photographic image. The thumbnail database files keep a record of multimedia files stored in specific folders. Even after the original file has been removed from the folder, the small database file may remain, containing miniature versions of the original file and file metadata. In this example, the file metadata contains <span class="strong"><strong>Exchangeable Image File Format</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>EXIF</strong></span>) data typical of <a id="id107" class="indexterm"/>photographs taken with a digital camera or device. This may provide additional details of the precise map reference where the image was taken for certain types of camera and, occasionally, the serial number of the camera.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/4931_02_09.jpg" alt="The metadata category"/><div class="caption"><p>Metadata of a thumbnail file of a JPEG image</p></div></div><p>Different file types provide basic metadata and sometimes even versions of the file, as in MS Word documents. The file properties shown in the next screenshot provide details of the file creation, modification, and last accessed timestamps and the file location:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/4931_02_10.jpg" alt="The metadata category"/><div class="caption"><p>The properties of a .bmp picture file</p></div></div><p>Opening the <a id="id108" class="indexterm"/>file may recover the author of a text document and<a id="id109" class="indexterm"/> other advanced settings. However, without using some form of write protection, such action may contaminate the file metadata. Preserving the file in pristine condition to prevent unintentional modification to the file contents and metadata is an overriding requirement of sound forensic practice.</p><p>If, for example, no forensic protection was used to protect file integrity, the mere copying of the file from one location to another on the same computer will automatically alter the metadata. This contamination of the evidentiary state of the file can have serious implications for a legal case and is likely to attract a challenge by the opposing legal team. <a class="link" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Recovering and Preserving Digital Evidence">Chapter 4</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Recovering and Preserving Digital Evidence</em></span>, describes the importance of protecting digital evidence and highlights various processes and forensic tools used to prevent contamination of the evidence.</p></div><div class="section" title="The content category"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec37"/>The content category</h2></div></div></div><p>The <a id="id110" class="indexterm"/>content category consists of the contents of a file, such as the<a id="id111" class="indexterm"/> text written to a document file, figures added to a spreadsheet, or a picture inside an image file. If recovered from unallocated space, it may have no linked metadata or filename, and the only clues to its antecedents may be gleaned <a id="id112" class="indexterm"/>from the file signature and clues garnered from the <a id="id113" class="indexterm"/>contents, especially text documents.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Locating evidence in filesystems"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl1sec20"/>Locating evidence in filesystems</h1></div></div></div><p>The nature of the transgression to some extent dictates the type of relevant evidence that may be recovered. For example, in a homicide where the victim died of gunshot wounds, it would be helpful to determine the time, location, and cause of death. A search would commence<a id="id114" class="indexterm"/> for the weapon; discharged bullets or shot, spent<a id="id115" class="indexterm"/> cartridges; gunpowder residue; blood spatter; and projectile trajectory data. At a microscopic level, DNA analysis of samples from the spent cartridge, chemical analysis of the gunpowder residue, postmortem analysis to determine the cause of death, and so forth will be undertaken.</p><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Locard's exchange principle,</em></span> described in <a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. The Role of Digital Forensics and Its Environment">Chapter 1</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>The Role of Digital Forensics and Its Environment</em></span>, is as relevant in a digital forensic examination as it is in the previous scenario. In a digital environment, we are also looking for the "smoking gun," which may take the form of a death threat sent to the victim by e-mail message. The e-mail itself has to be found, and the timestamp will help determine the time the message was sent. However, how do we know whether the date and time on the laptop were correct and which time zone was used? Can it be established that the message was created and actually sent from the seized laptop? Could a malicious user have created the message to cause mischief? Is there any other information that provides relevant background to the message or possible motivation? Who had access to the laptop if it was password protected?</p><p>One of the fundamental challenges practitioners face is determining with any certainty the link between a suspect and the data recovered from a computer. Without a human observer or perhaps a CCTV camera to place the suspect at the computer at the time of the transgression, it becomes a matter of an educated guess at best or speculation at worst. The practitioner must be guided by the evidence and if that proves inconclusive, he or she must look for more evidentiary clues to offer likely hypotheses as to what happened. The practitioner collects all relevant evidence that supports various hypotheses, but it is for others, such as juries, to decide whether the evidence helps determine guilt or innocence.</p><p>The challenge to practitioners is locating information or data of relevance to the case under investigation. Obviously, there has to be a reason for recovering data from devices—some transgression, offence, or activity that warrants the examination. The subject of the investigation tends to dictate the basic type of evidence that is being sought. However, finding the smoking gun may also mean looking for associated evidence that correlates with and corroborates the key evidence. It is also common for the examination to seek specific evidence in accordance with a legal brief, but during the examination, evidence of other transgressions may be recovered. Hence the need for vigilance and an open mind when trawling through digital cases.</p><p>In traditional<a id="id116" class="indexterm"/> forms of crime, investigators try to determine the<a id="id117" class="indexterm"/> means, opportunity, and motive for the transgressions being carried out. Some explanation as to how these three conditions apply in the digital environment would be helpful to consider before commencing a search for the evidence.</p><div class="section" title="Determining the means of transgression"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec38"/>Determining the means of transgression</h2></div></div></div><p>Investigators look for the means or suitable process a suspect used to carry out an illegal act, that is, determining how the transgression was carried out and by what process. The use of application software installed on a recovered device and linked to the transgression may record <a id="id118" class="indexterm"/>activities and may be useful for demonstrating how the transgression occurred. For example, the use of e-mail messaging to send a death threat or connecting to the Internet to download illegal pornography will leave an audit trail or event logs to allow a reconstruction of what happened and the processes involved. Reconstructing the transgression may be a relatively easy process, or it may be difficult to reconstruct because little record remains of the transgression and transgressors.</p><p>What appear to be simple concepts, such as sending a threatening e-mail, may require some proof that the message was created and sent from the seized device. On first inspection, this may appear to be so, but on further examination, it may become clear that while the e-mail account does record its dispatch, it does not necessarily establish that it was sent from the device. The process could have been completed by another person accessing the account remotely using a different computer. The practitioner would have to determine where the truth lay and undertake a thorough analysis of the e-mail message in relation to the computer being examined.</p><p>Another aspect of determining whether a suspect had the means to commission an offense is verifying whether the suspect had the computer skills to use the software involved, such as in the case of forging an electronic document or manipulating a photograph.</p></div><div class="section" title="Determining opportunity to transgress"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec39"/>Determining opportunity to transgress</h2></div></div></div><p>Having the <a id="id119" class="indexterm"/>opportunity to use a computer to do something illegal seems straightforward, but proving that the suspect alone had the opportunity through access to the computer may be problematic. It may be difficult, if not impossible, to link the time of the crime to a suspect's access to the computer or network in the absence of any corroboration. Audit logs recording the details of specific users accessing a computer or network often assume that the person who used the authorized user's logon details and password was the actual user. Often, that may be so, but if another person gained unauthorized access to the user details and logged on to the system, it may be difficult to prove unless there is some other evidence, such as a human observer or perhaps a CCTV recording, to clarify what occurred.</p><p>Audit<a id="id120" class="indexterm"/> and access user logs are not infallible and can be altered and falsified and are therefore not always reliable. Time and date stamps and file locations of key events help confirm the circumstances relating to a transgression. They may often help determine which user had the opportunity to transgress at a given time. Computer user access security may prohibit unauthorized access transgression and establish user identity. This would help narrow down the list of those users who may have been responsible for the transgression.</p><p>Ideally, determining who really had access to the device or network has to be established. Often, this is not conclusive and it is imprudent to assume the obvious. In criminal cases, much is made of assumptions as to who committed the offence, but it must be proven beyond reasonable doubt, and to a lesser extent in civil cases, where there is more of a balance of probability and a lower threshold. Yet, we still see a tendency to assume that the owner and custodian is usually the primary suspect for having carried out some unlawful activity. At least in the initial stages of an investigation, that seems logical. Further inquiry, though, can often show that others may have access to the computer or the network, so the circle of potential suspects widens. It follows that a thorough check of user access to the device must be completed. This is to show fairness in the examination to make sure that the list of potential users is determined.</p><p>Opportunity by a suspect may be discounted if a plausible and verifiable alibi can be offered to show that the suspect did not have the opportunity to commit the transgression. Many alibis are offered in computer-based crimes, including the fanciful and discredited alibi offered by Keith Griffin, sentenced to 12 years in jail in 2010 in the US for downloading child pornography onto his computer. Griffin blamed his cat for walking on the keyboard, resulting in the download of indecent photographs! (You can find more about the case at <a class="ulink" href="http://newsfeed.time.com/2010/09/12/man-blames-cat-for-child-porn-on-his-computer/">http://newsfeed.time.com/2010/09/12/man-blames-cat-for-child-porn-on-his-computer/</a>.)</p><p>The issue of analyzing data to link events to specific users is described in more detail in <a class="link" href="ch09.html" title="Chapter 9. Validating the Evidence">Chapter 9</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Validating the Evidence</em></span>.</p></div><div class="section" title="Determining the motive to transgress"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec40"/>Determining the motive to transgress</h2></div></div></div><p>It is not <a id="id121" class="indexterm"/>essential to prove motive, and it is often difficult to do so without perhaps some form of confession by the transgressor, for who knows what was in the mind of the transgressor at the time of the act? However, data may exist on a device that may offer some explanation to possible motivation or, for that matter, an absence of motive and criminal intent.</p><p>Motive <a id="id122" class="indexterm"/>may be determined by collecting evidence that links the user to some activities that confirm a degree of knowledge and control over the computer and relevant applications and files used in the transgression. Always be wary of the obvious. Speculation such as "it is the suspect's computer; therefore, the suspect is responsible" is highly inappropriate, even it if not voiced by the practitioner. As mentioned in <a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. The Role of Digital Forensics and Its Environment">Chapter 1</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>The Role of Digital Forensics and Its Environment</em></span>, evidence-led investigations and forensic examinations are logical and more scientifically objective, but in cases dependent on digital evidence, it can be a vexatious process to unravel the truth.</p><p>False evidence, too, can relatively easily be generated by mischief-makers out to implicate an innocent party, which is demonstrated in the case study at the end of this chapter.</p></div><div class="section" title="Deciding where to look for possible evidence"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec41"/>Deciding where to look for possible evidence</h2></div></div></div><p>We have a transgression; somebody had the means, the opportunity, and the motive to commit it<a id="id123" class="indexterm"/> using a computing device. Records of the applications and files used and the operating system can provide some useful electronic fingerprints to help practitioners reconstruct what happened, when it happened, where on the device or in the system it occurred, how it happened, and, hopefully, why it happened—the often-hard-to-prove motive. So where should the practitioner start?</p><p>Computers and other devices store information in directory systems of varying sorts, similar to Windows Explorer. This screenshot shows part of a Windows directory structure viewed through the advanced <a id="id124" class="indexterm"/>forensic tool ILookIX:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/4931_02_11.jpg" alt="Deciding where to look for possible evidence"/><div class="caption"><p>File directory structure under Windows 10</p></div></div><p>However, the number of files stored on a typical computer makes it impracticable because <a id="id125" class="indexterm"/>of time constraints and the fatigue of checking every file. Some are system files that will not normally be examined other than for specific checking. So, providing the practitioner with easy-to-review categories of files would be more helpful. If, for example, webpage files such as HTML and other categories were conveniently categorized, it would make locating and selecting evidence quicker and less tedious.</p><p>File categories can be divided into file signature and file type, as shown in ILookIX's <span class="strong"><strong>Category Explorer</strong></span> panel in the next screenshot.

It allows<a id="id142" class="indexterm"/> the data to be indexed based on file type and signature as well as filename, contents, metadata, time frame, size dimensions, and so on. So, for example, if looking for an e-mail death threat sent at an estimated time, the practitioner can search for all e-mails originating during that period and search for the content of the e-mail, such as details of the threat. The search could also be filtered to save time by looking for sender and receiver details that match known information.</p><p>Searches may be <span class="strong"><strong>index-based</strong></span> or keyword searches. Index-based searches require the indexing<a id="id143" class="indexterm"/> of each file in the dataset that the practitioner decides may be relevant to the examination and can filter out extraneous files that would otherwise slow down the indexing and searching processes. Although indexing can take some time, it is machine-generated and will be described in more detail in <a class="link" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. The Need for Enhanced Forensic Tools">Chapter 5</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>The Need for Enhanced Forensic Tools</em></span>. Once the dataset is indexed, the time for a search is almost instantaneous, with quicker results of hits being provided to the practitioner.

For<a id="id149" class="indexterm"/> example, a newly acquired laptop may have on it the operating system and a range of basic software applications, system files, user data, and so forth. The remaining space, in pristine condition, is available to store data as required by the user, system, and software applications. This free space or unallocated space is initially empty but soon starts getting filled during normal usage.</p><p>Files may be recovered from allocated space, where they are maintained by the operating system in what is called a logical state. Most of the files here, unless they are hidden files, may be located and recovered during forensic recovery. The same may be said of deleted files that remain in the <code class="literal">trash</code> folder.</p><p>Eventually, the device can run out of space and crash the operating system or at least make its operation sluggish. Files are frequently deleted by users and held in the trash bin, from where they may be restored or removed back into unallocated space. There, the remnants of the file remain but will be further eroded and eventually completely overwritten by new files being written to and occupying the same space.</p><p>However, forensic tools allow the practitioner to recover these files or fragments of deleted files that may assist in reconstructing key events in a case. Deleted files may be readily recoverable by checking for deleted filenames held in file directories. However, it is not uncommon for the names of deleted files to be reused before any changes to the metadata are made. The files may have retained no filename, but the file metadata may still persist. Conversely, the filename and metadata may remain but not the file contents.</p><p>Consistency checking of unallocated blocks by an experienced practitioner may reveal deliberate attempts at data hiding or filesystem errors that have hidden data. Data wiping may be detected too by finding a zeroed or invalid entry between two valid entries. Data carving is the technique used to undertake the recovery of file fragments and can be done manually<a id="id150" class="indexterm"/> using a hex editor or automatically <a id="id151" class="indexterm"/>using advanced forensic tools.

They outline the basic processes of managing the security of computer devices and networks as well as describing the reasons why digital information needs protection from a wide range of threats.</p><div class="section" title="User access to computer devices"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec44"/>User access to computer devices</h2></div></div></div><p>To protect data stored on a device from unauthorized access, user access controls offer some degree <a id="id155" class="indexterm"/>of protection. This applies to <a id="id156" class="indexterm"/>desktops, laptops, mobile phones and other handheld <a id="id157" class="indexterm"/>devices, home security systems, and a broad range of other electronic equipment. Not only is it essential to restrict direct human access to information to those who are authorized, but the information also needs protection from access by other programs, processes, or systems that may be connected to the device. For example, workers logged in to a network server should normally have no access to other workers' terminals (unless in a supervisory or support role). Otherwise, there would be no security of sensitive information, and it would be a chaotic situation at best.</p><p>So why is user access so important? Well, information has value in terms of its confidentiality, integrity, and availability, which are all at risk and need protection. These terms are described in the following subsections.</p></div><div class="section" title="Understanding the importance of information confidentiality"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec45"/>Understanding the importance of information confidentiality</h2></div></div></div><p>Confidentiality or<a id="id158" class="indexterm"/> privacy is required to<a id="id159" class="indexterm"/> prevent unauthorized access to information. Even if the access is authorized, a user may use that information in an unauthorized way. For example, a coworker sees that a colleague has left the office but has left the computer running, thus permitting unauthorized access. The coworker accesses the computer and reads some confidential documents and puts knowledge of that information to improper (unauthorized) use. Later, the custodian of the information is investigated and there is no record of unauthorized access to his or her computer. The practitioner may be able to reconstruct the events and times of the unauthorized access, but it is unlikely that evidence of the intruder will be detected from the computer records.</p></div><div class="section" title="Understanding the importance of information integrity"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec46"/>Understanding the importance of information integrity</h2></div></div></div><p>The integrity <a id="id160" class="indexterm"/>of information also requires <a id="id161" class="indexterm"/>protection: some sort of assurance or guarantee that the information has remained in pristine condition, is unaltered, and is uncontaminated. The creator and custodian of the information need some confidence that it has not been altered or corrupted by unauthorized action by human intervention or perhaps by a computer or system glitch.</p><p>Take, for example, a hacker gaining access to a victim's computer, such as a bank computer, and secretly changing the contents of important financial records as part of an online fraud. Such attacks not only alter the integrity of the records, but somebody gains and somebody loses. It also follows that bank personnel who have legitimate access to the records initially become the prime suspects.</p><p>The integrity of information requires some guarantee, then, that the information was not subject to unauthorized creation, modification, or manipulation and that all related transactions were genuine and proper.</p></div><div class="section" title="Understanding the importance of information availability"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec47"/>Understanding the importance of information availability</h2></div></div></div><p>Information availability means that information is accessible to those wishing to use it. However, a<a id="id162" class="indexterm"/> user may inadvertently deny themselves <a id="id163" class="indexterm"/>or others access to information, or a system process may render the information unavailable. Hackers and other malcontents use cyberattacks to deny users and organizations access to their own information. These attacks are termed <a id="id164" class="indexterm"/>
<span class="strong"><strong>denial of availability attacks</strong></span> and may also involve some form of extortion, demanding financial payment to ensure the information is made accessible once again to its rightful owners. A forensic examination of the networks and infected computer terminals may find the cause of the denial and allow the organization to restore access to continue normal business. An insight into<a id="id165" class="indexterm"/> new approaches of malware<a id="id166" class="indexterm"/> detection will be provided in <a class="link" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. The Need for Enhanced Forensic Tools">Chapter 5</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>The Need for Enhanced Forensic Tools</em></span>.</p></div><div class="section" title="User access security controls"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec48"/>User access security controls</h2></div></div></div><p>Protecting a<a id="id167" class="indexterm"/> computer, mobile phone, or network from unauthorized access is part of the security management of information <a id="id168" class="indexterm"/>resources. A day does not pass without there being some headline of cybersecurity breaches or us hearing of acquaintances whose computer or network has been attacked and compromised by an intruder. With the advances in technologies intended to improve the human condition comes a sinister downside threatening the privacy, integrity, and availability of information assets.</p><p>Protection against unauthorized access is done through strictly regulating who can access the data and what data can be accessed. User access management may be regarded as the first line of defense and is seldom infallible. It uses a range of protection processes based on an established security policy. For example, in its simplest form, when purchasing a new laptop computer, the user is usually granted administrator access—a higher level of management control of the device. As administrator, other users and guest users may be allowed to use the device by the creation of other user accounts, which may or may not be password protected.</p><p>For network systems, a more complex hierarchy of access control is used to channel a larger number of network users through tight access control points and levels. A list of users and details of their access rights or privileges is recorded, and an audit record of the date, time, and duration of each user's access would be recorded.</p><p>Passwords or passphrases are normally used in conjunction with the user's unique identification name. Biometric protection, such as fingerprint and iris detection, may be used, or some other form of security protection may be in place to deter and minimize the likelihood of unauthorized exploits.</p><p>Various applications provide some means of bypassing or unlocking hidden passwords so that access to the contents of a drive become readily available. Password-protected devices can present difficulties to practitioners seeking to examine a device, especially if the contents are encrypted, which is outlined more in the following subsection.</p></div><div class="section" title="Encrypted devices and files"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec49"/>Encrypted devices and files</h2></div></div></div><p>Encryption has <a id="id169" class="indexterm"/>been used for millennia to conceal information <a id="id170" class="indexterm"/>from unauthorized viewing; even<a id="id171" class="indexterm"/> when<a id="id172" class="indexterm"/> the message has been intercepted, encryption prevents, or at least hinders, unauthorized viewing of the contents of the message or container. In terms of protecting digital devices and messages, various forms of privacy security technologies are used to maintain the confidentiality of information. Encryption technologies are apparent on most digital devices, notably desktop computers, mobile phones and tablets, and server networks. They also include the secure encryption of e-mail and other telecommunication messages.</p><p>The <a id="id173" class="indexterm"/>Achilles heel of encryption, irrespective of its level of encryption, is the password or passphrase or other form of access control used to open the encrypted store. Without this access key, the data will remain unopened. Some simple forms of encryption, such as Word document protection, may be easily thwarted by the use of readily available programs on the Internet that will defeat the simple encryption protecting the documents. More advanced encryption applications may also be circumvented, but the robustness <a id="id174" class="indexterm"/>of the algorithm used to protect the information <a id="id175" class="indexterm"/>may make it a time-consuming process to<a id="id176" class="indexterm"/> open the store. Advanced encryption techniques used on <a id="id177" class="indexterm"/>more recent devices and, particularly, mobile phones with encrypted sectors and microchips are presently defeating experts seeking access with supposedly sophisticated forensic tools.</p><p>The problems facing practitioners confronted with locked and encrypted devices is becoming a serious challenge and will be discussed later in the book.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Case study &#x2013; linking the evidence to the user"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl1sec22"/>Case study – linking the evidence to the user</h1></div></div></div><p>This case study relates to the examination of a forensic image of the defendant's laptop computer <a id="id178" class="indexterm"/>provided by law enforcement officers in 2006. A number of photographs and videos of underage sex were discovered on the defendant's laptop by a computer repairer, who reported the matter to the police, resulting in the seizure of the laptop and criminal charges being laid in 2008. The 2 year delay from arrest to trial may be assumed to be due to the heavy workload of the agency involved.</p><p>The defendant's apparent disbelief that he had downloaded illegal, pornographic files onto the laptop and the insistence of his innocence prompted the defense team's examination to measure the reliability of the relevant information, thereby assisting subsequent legal analysis. The offending material had been placed on the laptop during 2004 and 2005, and the laptop had been repaired by the same computer repairer during this period, who evidently did not notice and report sighting the material on the first occasion.</p><p>Examination by the defense team expert of the available information derived from the physical and logical restoration of the seized computer confirmed the police assertion that illegal movie files were most likely downloaded during the period between September and October 2004. It was evident that these files were most likely downloaded to the laptop through the use of the LimeWire program, with the remainder downloaded in January 2005 and probably viewed at that time on the device.</p><p>Both RealPlayer <a id="id179" class="indexterm"/>and Windows Media Player were installed on the computer, based on an examination of the relevant file-creation dates of the executable parts of the programs. These applications play movie, audio, and image files. Both applications have the ability to record the viewing of the most recently played files. According to the agency report, a number of the most recently played files had the same filenames as those identified as the movies of interest. Re-examination of the data confirmed that a number of the illegal files had been accessed several times by RealPlayer and only on one occasion by Windows Media Player.</p><p>The defendant's young teenage child had access to the laptop during the period, and two obscene image files were created on the computer and accessed. The last accessed dates of the movie and images were inadvertently altered by the virus-scanning program, obfuscating the dates and making reconstruction of the movie and image viewer applications incomplete. The agency's misreading of the unreliable last accessed date of the key files was tendered as evidence of the files being accessed by a user, thereby extending the period of possible criminal activity. In fact, the file metadata challenged the assertion and weakened the prosecution claim.</p><p>Taking the digital evidence at face value, at the point of seizure of the laptop, it may have seemed logical to assume that the defendant, the owner and custodian of the computer and whose house it was located in, was the likely suspect. However, others had access to the computer during the periods in which the movies were accessed and viewed between September 2005 to the date of seizure in 2006. Moreover, a young couple who lived at the residence from late June 2005 to early February 2006 also had unrestricted access. A number of other persons (friends of the couple) also had access to the laptop during the same period. Another person also lived at the residence between July 2005 and September 2005. It was common for the defendant to take the laptop to his place of work, where others were granted unrestricted access to it.</p><p>There was also evidence of the defendant being absent from his town during the time some of the illegal files were downloaded and played on the laptop. The defendant's teenage child was present and had a number of friends stay over at the home on a weekly basis, and they were believed to have used the laptop. Password security was basic, and the password known to whoever wished to use it.</p><p>Examination by the defense expert of the reconstructed usage timeline showed that an illegal movie file was modified and written to on 17 October 2005, when the laptop was believed to be in the possession of the computer repairer. This matter was not raised by the prosecution or disclosed to the defense team, yet it raised the likelihood of another potential suspect.</p><p>There was also some discrepancy over the actual number of illegal movies and duplicates of the same files located on the device. However, re-examination of the forensic image showed there to be six unique movies and nine copies of some of the files in contrast to a much large number claimed by the prosecution. The lack of precise recording of the files key to the <a id="id180" class="indexterm"/>prosecution's case raised doubts as to the professionalism of the prosecution expert.</p><p>The presence of malicious software in the form of a Trojan, <code class="literal">A0044827.exe Infected: Backdoor.Win32.Agent</code>, was evident on the computer. However, it was not shown that the malware had infected and facilitated control of the laptop rendering it vulnerable to unauthorized remote control. Again, checking of this malware's activity on the laptop was left to the defense expert to determine and at cost to the defendant!</p><p>Not surprisingly, the case against the defendant was dismissed.</p><p>This may well contribute to incomplete and biased analysis leading to a conviction using questionable evidence and faulty analysis. Great care must always be taken to ensure evidence-led investigation and not a suspect-led process, as appears to have occurred in this investigation.</p></div>

<div class="section" title="Summary"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl1sec24"/>Summary</h1></div></div></div><p>This chapter described a variety of computers and storage devices and outlined the nature of digital information they hold of potential evidentiary value. The explanation of the functions and nature of operating system software and applications introduced the processes of file creation, file transfer, and the storage of electronic information. The chapter introduced and explained the nature of filesystems and outlined some typical files that contain evidence of evidentiary value and where they may be located on devices. A summary of password security and encryption has shown that digital devices are becoming more advanced and are using encryption as an effective security feature. This now poses some significant problems to practitioners attempting to look for concealed evidence.</p><p>Digital evidence as presented in this chapter is described in greater detail in <a class="link" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. The Nature and Special Properties of Digital Evidence">Chapter 3</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>The Nature and Special Properties of Digital Evidence</em></span>, which explains its nature and special attributes and really does dictate the forensic approach practitioners follow when engaged in case examinations. Digital evidence shares many of the characteristics of other types of evidence, but it does have unique properties of its own that make it both rewarding and challenging to explore and harness. <a class="link" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. The Nature and Special Properties of Digital Evidence">Chapter 3</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>The Nature and Special Properties of Digital Evidence</em></span>, highlights the technical complexities of digital evidence and the challenges they pose to practitioners in their analysis and explanation of the evidence to the courts. It defines the weight of admissibility and the requirements that digital forensics must meet for it to be considered admissible for use in legal cases.</p></div></body></html>
