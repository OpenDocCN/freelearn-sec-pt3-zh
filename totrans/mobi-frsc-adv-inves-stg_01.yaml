    has resulted in smartphones holding a lot of sensitive data about their users.
    Mobile devices keep the user's contacts from a variety of sources (including the
    phone, social networks, instant messaging, and communication applications), information
    about phone calls, sent and received text messages, and e-mails and attachments.
    There are also browser logs and cached geolocation information; pictures and videos
    taken with the phone's camera; passwords to cloud services, forums, social networks,
    online portals, and shopping websites; stored payment data; and a lot of other
    information that can be vital for an investigation.

    connect it to a charger, and place into a Faraday bag. The anti-forensic method
    used by some technologically-advanced suspects on Android phones involves rooting
    the device and installing a tool that monitors wireless connectivity of the device.
    If the tool detects that the device has been idle, connected to a charger, and
    without wireless connectivity for a predefined period, it performs a factory reset.
    Since there is no practical way of determining whether such protection is active
    on the device prior to acquisition, simply following established guidelines presents
    a risk of evidence being destroyed. If there are reasonable grounds to suspect
    such a system may be in place, the device can be powered down (while realizing

    full access to the device even if it's locked with a passcode. However, if the
    device is encrypted and the passcode is part of the encryption key, bypassing
    passcode protection may not automatically enable access to encrypted data.

    the operating system's security measures and allowing the acquisition tool to
    read information from protected areas. This is one of the reasons for banning
    rooted devices (as well as devices with unlocked bootloaders) from corporate premises.

    third-party code to be injected and run on a system level. This fact is well-known
    to forensic experts who make use of tools such as Cellebrite UFED or Elcomsoft
    iOS Forensic Toolkit to perform physical acquisition of jailbroken Apple smartphones.

    straightforward rooting of the device. While not all Android devices with unlocked
    bootloaders are rooted, installing root access during acquisition of a bootloader-unlocked
    device has a much higher chance of success compared to devices that are locked
    down. Tools such as Cellebrite UFED, **Forensic Toolkit** (**FTK**), Oxygen Forensic
    Suite, and many others can make use of the phone's root status in order to inject
    acquisition applets and image the device.

    exploit exists and is used in UFED to perform acquisition of many Android and
    Windows phone devices based on the Qualcomm reference platform even if their bootloader
    is locked.

    a conscious effort of tapping on the OS build number multiple times. Some users

    debugging** or **ADB debugging**. If enabled, this option allows controlling the
    device via the ADB command line, which in turn allows experts using Android debugging
    tools (**adb.exe**) to connect to the device from a PC even if it's locked with
    a passcode. Activated **USB debugging** exposes a lot of possibilities and can
    make acquisition possible even if the device is locked with a passcode.

    tool may not be possible unless the phone has a SIM card in it. Moreover, some
    devices can be configured to invoke protection if a different SIM card is used.
    On rare occasions, devices can even be configured to wipe their content if a non-original
    SIM card is inserted or if a SIM card is removed. In particular, some BlackBerry
    devices may block extraction attempts with a message reading **SIM Not Provisioned**
    or **SIM Not Allowed**. In such cases, using a cloned SIM card may enable communication
    and allow the extraction.

    remove the memory card from the mobile device/tablet and use either hardware or
    software write-protection methods to create a bit stream forensic image of the
    memory card, which can then be analyzed using forensic software tools, such as
    X-Ways, Autopsy Sleuth Kit, Forensic Explorer (GetData), EnCase, or FTK (AccessData).

- en: This stage of mobile device forensics entails analysis of the acquired data
    from the device and its components (SIM card and memory card if present). Most
    mobile forensic acquisition tools that acquire the data from the device memory
    can also parse the extracted data and provide the examiner functionality within
    the tool to perform analysis. This entails review of any non-deleted and deleted
    data.
  prefs: []

- en: When reviewing non-deleted data, it would be prudent to also perform a manual
    review of the device to ensure that the extracted and parsed data matches what
    is displayed by the device. As mobile device storage capacities have increased,
    it is suggested that a limited subset of data records from the relevant areas
    be reviewed. So, for example, if a mobile device has over 200 call records, reviewing
    several call records from missed calls, incoming calls, and outgoing calls can
    be checked on the device in relation to the similar records in the extracted data.
    By doing this manual review, it is then possible to discover any discrepancies
    in the extracted data.

- en: Manual device review can only be completed when the device is still in the custody
    of the examiner. There are situations where, after the data extraction has been
    completed, the device is released back to the investigator or owner. In situations
    such as this, the examiner should document that very limited or no manual verification
    can be performed due to these circumstances.

    can be used to analyze the acquired data. Multiple analysis tools should be considered,
    especially when a specific type of data cannot be parsed by one tool, but can
    be analyzed by another.

    the amount of evidence available in today's mobile devices and covered the general
    steps of mobile forensics. We also discussed how to seize, handle, and store mobile
    devices, and looked at how criminals can use technology to prevent forensic access.
    We provided a general overview of the acquisition and analysis steps. In the next
    chapter, we'll discuss acquisition methods in more detail. We'll overview different
    acquisition methods and techniques, and look at their applicability in different
    situations.
