			<p><em class="italic">"As an inventor and researcher, I realize that the degree of vulnerability of an organization depends on how the infrastructure was implemented, managed, and designed," </em></p>
			<p><em class="italic">– Sarbajit Rakshit, IBM Master Inventor</em></p>
			<p>Almost all companies have Windows systems in their infrastructure, either as workstations, servers, or directory services. Therefore, to master the art of cybersecurity, you need to know which strategies, techniques, and tools to apply, but also <em class="italic">how</em> and <em class="italic">when</em> to apply them to achieve the desired level of security in your infrastructure.</p>
			<p>To achieve those goals, we are going to cover the following main topics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>How to apply the best hardening strategies on Windows servers</li>
				<li>Creation of your own hardening checklist for Windows servers</li>
				<li>Designing a world-class patching strategy </li>
				<li>An overview of all the different types of patches for Windows systems</li>
				<li>Best cybersecurity practices for <strong class="bold">Active Directory</strong> (<strong class="bold">AD</strong>)</li>
				<li>A guide to best practices for endpoint security</li>
				<li>An overview of how to leverage encryption to keep your data secure</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-129"><a id="_idTextAnchor133"/>Technical requirements </h1>
			<p>There are no hard requirements for this chapter; however, it would be useful to have access to a Windows 10 machine to test some of the concepts that we will cover through the book (patching, encryption, policies, and so on). </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-130"><a id="_idTextAnchor134"/>Applying Windows hardening</h1>
			<p class="author-quote">Nothing is impossible to break; just make it hard enough to make them want another target.</p>
			<p>As you know, <strong class="bold">hardening</strong> is <a id="_idIndexMarker675"/>a fancy name for all the techniques used to protect a given server from attacks. While hardening is not a bullet-proof solution, its aim is to increase the security of a server to an acceptable level to prevent the majority of attacks. </p>
			<p>In general, a<a id="_idIndexMarker676"/> properly hardened server should be protected against all scripted or automated attacks.</p>
			<p>There are normally two ways to apply hardening, as outlined here:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Applied by a separate team (<strong class="bold">information technology</strong> (<strong class="bold">IT</strong>) infrastructure) </li>
				<li>Another applied by the security team (you)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Let's take a look at your responsibilities when hardening is performed by the infrastructure team.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-131"><a id="_idTextAnchor135"/>Hardening by the infrastructure team</h2>
			<p>In this case, the <a id="_idIndexMarker677"/>hardening is performed (executed) by another team; however, you may still be accountable for ensuring that the server is secure, so in that case, you need to at least perform the following actions:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Provide the team with a <em class="italic">checklist</em> of the minimal hardening required.</li>
				<li>Perform regular audits to ensure the servers have the minimal hardening requirements.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Let's take a look at how to <a id="_idIndexMarker678"/>create a <strong class="bold">comprehensive hardening checklist</strong> that you can provide to the infrastructure team to ensure that at least the minimum required steps are performed.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-132"><a id="_idTextAnchor136"/>Creating a hardening checklist</h2>
			<p>A hardening checklist<a id="_idIndexMarker679"/> will be influenced by several factors, including corporate risk appetite, cybersecurity policies, and applicable regulations. Here, we are going to review the most common items that must be included to create the<a id="_idIndexMarker680"/> ultimate <strong class="bold">Windows hardening checklist</strong>.</p>
			<p>Regardless of who is responsible for performing Windows hardening, this checklist will contain the basic items that need to be performed to ensure that your Windows servers have the basic <a id="_idIndexMarker681"/>protections in place.</p>
			<p>Let's now take a look at the required elements of your hardening checklist.</p>
			<h3>Supported OS versions</h3>
			<p>This is a very important factor to <a id="_idIndexMarker682"/>take into consideration because while newer versions have a lot of security features, such as the introduction of Windows Defender <strong class="bold">Advanced Threat Protection</strong> (<strong class="bold">ATP</strong>) on Windows <a id="_idIndexMarker683"/>Server 2019, older versions have lower levels of security and you should therefore try to encourage the use of newer versions on new builds.</p>
			<p>Here are some of the rules<a id="_idIndexMarker684"/> that should be included in this section of the checklist:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Never allow unsupported versions of Windows servers in your infrastructure.</li>
				<li>Keep an inventory of the server infrastructure, which should include <em class="italic">end-of-support</em> dates.</li>
				<li>Create a plan to start the migration of future <em class="italic">end-of-support</em> servers at least a year before the effective <em class="italic">end-of-support</em> date.</li>
				<li>Create a policy to enforce that all servers must include all updates, patches, and service packs before being set in production.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In case you cannot upgrade the servers due to a lack of budget, the recommendation is to create a risk letter that includes all the cybersecurity risks associated with having that old server in your infrastructure (with the associated costs) and present that to upper management. That way, they will either give you the budget for the new servers or accept the risk, and in that case, you will have your back covered.</p>
			<h3>Windows services and features</h3>
			<p>Windows servers have a set of default services that start automatically at startup. While many of those services are required by the OS to function properly, some of them are optional and may represent a potential vulnerability.</p>
			<p>While newer versions load just the minimal required services, old OS server versions may need additional tuning to disable some non-essential services. </p>
			<p>Here are some items to<a id="_idIndexMarker685"/> include in the checklist regarding this topic:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Ask each server owner to create a list of the enabled services, including a justification for each particular service.</li>
				<li>Ask the server owners to perform at least a quarterly validation of the services to ensure that unused services are disabled.</li>
				<li>Ask the server owners to create a <em class="italic">risk justification letter</em> in case any of the services running are listed as <em class="italic">high risk</em> in the corporate cybersecurity policies.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>An example justification list is shown in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_6.1_B16290.jpg" alt="Figure 6.1 – Services justification list&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.1 – Services justification list</p>
			<p>Additionally, take into consideration that Windows services run in the security context of a specific user (local system, local service, or network service accounts). However, for <em class="italic">application</em> and <em class="italic">user services</em>, the recommendation is to set up specific accounts, (locally or in AD) to handle these services with the minimum rights.</p>
			<h3>Ports and protocols</h3>
			<p>Similar to <a id="_idIndexMarker686"/>services, <strong class="bold">ports and protocols</strong> should be maintained at a minimum to<a id="_idIndexMarker687"/> reduce potential attack vectors.</p>
			<p>Checklist items include the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Ask each server owner to create a list of open ports (including a justification).</li>
				<li>Ask the server owners to perform at least a quarterly validation of the opened ports to ensure that all open ports are in use.</li>
				<li>Ask the server<a id="_idIndexMarker688"/> owners to create a <em class="italic">risk justification letter</em> in case<a id="_idIndexMarker689"/> any of the open ports are listed as <em class="italic">high risk</em> in the corporate cybersecurity policies.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>A common technique used by criminals is to scan ports; therefore, following those simple steps will considerably enhance the security of your servers.</p>
			<h3>User management</h3>
			<p>Also known <a id="_idIndexMarker690"/>as <strong class="bold">Identity and Access Management</strong> (<strong class="bold">IAM</strong>), this is normally handled by a separate team that follows<a id="_idIndexMarker691"/> IAM processes to create, delete, and disable user <strong class="bold">identifiers</strong> (<strong class="bold">IDs</strong>).</p>
			<p>Here are the relevant points for our checklist:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>All user management should be created by the IAM team.</li>
				<li>All local users must be created by the IAM team.</li>
				<li>All server owners must follow the IAM process (create, delete, disable, and update user accounts).</li>
				<li>All accounts must have an associated person as the owner.</li>
				<li>Accounts should be created based on the <strong class="bold">principle of least privilege</strong> (<strong class="bold">PoLP</strong>). </li>
				<li>Password policies must be enforced by the system (server or Active Directory).</li>
				<li>Prevent users from disabling <strong class="bold">User Account Control</strong> (<strong class="bold">UAC</strong>).</li>
				<li>Block Microsoft account login.</li>
				<li>Block guest accounts.</li>
				<li>Account lockout must be aligned with current cybersecurity policies. As seen in the following screenshot, this is configured on the Windows <strong class="bold">Local Group Policy Editor</strong>:</li>
			</ul>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_6.2_B16290.jpg" alt="Figure 6.2 – Lockout policy: Windows Group Policy Editor&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.2 – Lockout policy: Windows Group Policy Editor</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Disable the <a id="_idIndexMarker692"/>default <em class="italic">admin</em> account (this account poses a high risk of brute-force attacks because account lockout is disabled). </li>
				<li>Restrict users with blank passwords.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Additional items will be covered in the <em class="italic">Applying security to AD</em> section.</p>
			<h3>Monitoring </h3>
			<p>You need to keep your<a id="_idIndexMarker693"/> infrastructure under control at all times, and monitoring and logs are key in case any forensics are needed. Therefore, there are a couple of important items that should be included in our checklist, as detailed here:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Ensure <em class="italic">logs</em> are enabled in all servers.</li>
				<li>Ensure that <em class="italic">corporate monitoring systems</em> are loaded and running on all production servers.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Have a look at the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_6.3_B16290.jpg" alt="Figure 6.3 – Audit policies: Windows Group Policy Editor&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.3 – Audit policies: Windows Group Policy Editor</p>
			<p>As seen in the preceding<a id="_idIndexMarker694"/> screenshot, those settings can be accessed for configuration and verification (audit) on the Windows <code>Advanced Audit Policy Configuration</code> folder.</p>
			<h3>Additional considerations for your checklist</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>If available, ensure <a id="_idIndexMarker695"/>that <strong class="bold">Control flow guard</strong> (<strong class="bold">CFG</strong>) and <strong class="bold">Data Execution Prevention</strong> (<strong class="bold">DEP</strong>) are <a id="_idIndexMarker696"/>turned on. Normally, they are set to <strong class="bold">On by default</strong>, but you can<a id="_idIndexMarker697"/> check the status by following these steps:<ol><li>Go to <strong class="bold">Windows Defender Security Center</strong>.</li><li>Click on <strong class="bold">App &amp; browser control</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong class="bold">Exploit protection settings</strong>.</li><li>Go to <strong class="bold">System settings</strong>, and you will see options for <strong class="bold">Control flow guard</strong><strong class="bold"> </strong><strong class="bold">(CFG)</strong> and <strong class="bold">Data Execution Prevention (DEP)</strong>, as illustrated in the following screenshot:</li></ol></li>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.4 – Windows embedded exploit protection </p>
			<ul>
				<li>Request a <a id="_idIndexMarker698"/>strong antivirus solution on the server (this could be a third-party solution or Windows Defender).</li>
				<li>Enable <strong class="bold">Windows AppLocker</strong>.</li>
				<li>Ensure the <strong class="bold">Basic Input/Output System</strong> (<strong class="bold">BIOS</strong>) is password-protected.</li>
				<li>Enable <strong class="bold">Secure Boot</strong>.</li>
				<li>All volumes should be NTFS (FAT should not be allowed).</li>
				<li>Disable the sending of unencrypted passwords to third-party <strong class="bold">Service Message Block</strong> (<strong class="bold">SMB</strong>) servers.</li>
				<li>Only allow <strong class="bold">NTLMv2</strong> on <strong class="bold">LAN Manager</strong> authentication level and refuse <strong class="bold">LM</strong> and <strong class="bold">NTLM</strong>.</li>
				<li>Configure <strong class="bold">Microsoft Network Server</strong> to always sign communications digitally.</li>
				<li>Ensure that <strong class="bold">Anonymous SID/Name translation</strong> is disabled.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Anonymous enumeration of SAM accounts and shares</strong> should be disabled.</li>
				<li>Do not allow shared drives to be accessed anonymously.</li>
				<li>If available, enable cloud-based protection, such as <strong class="bold">Microsoft Operations Management Suite</strong> (<strong class="bold">OMS</strong>).</li>
				<li>Ensure encryption is enabled (<strong class="bold">Encrypting File System</strong> (<strong class="bold">EFS</strong>) or <strong class="bold">BitLocker</strong>).</li>
				<li>If the server<a id="_idIndexMarker699"/> is hosting some <strong class="bold">virtual machines</strong> (<strong class="bold">VMs</strong>), make sure that <strong class="bold">Virtual Machine Trusted Platform Module (TPM)</strong> is enabled as it will support advanced security technologies such as <strong class="bold">BitLocker drive encryption</strong>.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Now, it's time to see how to create an enterprise patching strategy.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-133"><a id="_idTextAnchor137"/>Creating a patching strategy</h1>
			<p>How many times<a id="_idIndexMarker700"/> have you heard, "<em class="italic">This attack could be prevented if the systems were properly patched</em>"? And the cost of those attacks was between millions of dollars to even bankruptcy, so here, the question is: <em class="italic">Why is this still happening?</em></p>
			<p>Well, the answer is because patching is not as simple as it sounds.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-134"><a id="_idTextAnchor138"/>The complexity of patching</h2>
			<p>Let´s take a look at the most common complexity factors associated with patching.</p>
			<h3>Legacy systems</h3>
			<p>Almost all companies have a degree of legacy systems<a id="_idIndexMarker701"/> in production. Most of the time, this is because some applications were designed to run only on a specific OS, and migrating it to a supported OS may cause compatibility issues, so companies decided just to accept the risk.</p>
			<p>The problem is that in those cases, you may have some unsupported OSes (or even apps, services, and protocols) that bring additional risks to your infrastructure.</p>
			<p>The recommendations<a id="_idIndexMarker702"/> to patch legacy systems are outlined here:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Perform testing to determine whether is possible to migrate to a supported OS.</li>
				<li>Research alternative systems that can replace said legacy apps.</li>
				<li>If the first two options are not achievable, then make sure that the system has the latest available updates (patches and hotfixes) installed.</li>
				<li>Remove all unnecessary apps from the system.</li>
				<li> Reduce the enabled ports to the minimum required by the app and disable the rest of them.</li>
				<li>Disable all unused services.</li>
				<li>Disable all unused startup apps. </li>
				<li>Disable <strong class="bold">Remote Desktop</strong> (<strong class="bold">RDP</strong>).</li>
				<li>Avoid making these servers internet-facing, and if required, apply additional security<a id="_idIndexMarker703"/> mechanisms such as requiring a <strong class="bold">virtual private network</strong> (<strong class="bold">VPN</strong>) to connect. </li>
				<li>Schedule regular maintenance (at least quarterly) to check the server status.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Additionally, it is a good practice to perform regular validation of your server environment (at least twice per year) to ensure which of them are still in use (and remove any <em class="italic">ghost</em> or <em class="italic">unused</em> servers).</p>
			<h3>Dependencies and compatibility issues</h3>
			<p>Most apps have a lot of dependencies<a id="_idIndexMarker704"/> such as .NET Framework, the <strong class="bold">Java Runtime Environment</strong> (<strong class="bold">JRE</strong>), <strong class="bold">PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor</strong> (<strong class="bold">PHP</strong>), and so on, which means that to run those apps properly, you need to have those frameworks installed and running in the OS. </p>
			<p>Most of the time, those frameworks<a id="_idIndexMarker705"/> have <strong class="bold">backward compatibility</strong>, meaning they will also support apps created for old frameworks. However, this is not always true and there are cases in which you need to keep an old framework to keep your legacy app running.</p>
			<p>In those cases, the following is<a id="_idIndexMarker706"/> recommended:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Evaluate the possibility of newer apps to replace legacy ones.</li>
				<li>Evaluate, document, and present the risks to upper management to consider whether they are willing to accept this risk.</li>
				<li>Evaluate the data managed by said app and use that as input to determine the impact of the risk.</li>
				<li>If there is a high risk involved, search for known vulnerabilities (related to that version of said dependency at <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/">https://cve.mitre.org/</a> ) to determine and apply workarounds to reduce the risk of attacks.</li>
				<li>Isolate the machine to just host said application to reduce the scope of the risk.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Now, it's time to show you how to begin creating your patching strategy.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-135"><a id="_idTextAnchor139"/>Distribution of tasks (patching roles and assignments)</h2>
			<p>In most companies, patching<a id="_idIndexMarker707"/> is performed by IT infrastructure teams. However, in terms of cybersecurity, you may be responsible for ensuring that all servers are properly patched, so here are some recommendations to ensure a smooth operation between you and the infrastructure team:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Work together in the creation of a patching chronogram.</li>
				<li>Create an <em class="italic">RACI matrix</em> to determine who is <em class="italic">responsible, accountable, consulted, and informed</em> about the installation and deployment of updates on the servers.</li>
				<li>Establish a process to request urgent patches and hotfixes.</li>
				<li>Create a communications plan that includes contact information for the whole IT team.</li>
				<li>Create a responsibility matrix that includes all relevant information about the servers and the teams that support them. You can see an example of a responsibility matrix in the following screenshot: </li>
			</ul>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_6.5_B16290.jpg" alt="Figure 6.5 – OS support responsibility matrix&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.5 – OS support responsibility matrix</p>
			<p>The preceding OS support responsibility matrix has five columns; however, you may extend it as required<a id="_idIndexMarker708"/> to include all relevant information. </p>
			<p>Also, make sure to define who is responsible for updating those documents, where they will be stored, and how often they must be updated.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-136"><a id="_idTextAnchor140"/>Distribution and deployment of patches</h2>
			<p>On small<a id="_idIndexMarker709"/> infrastructures, this may be a straightforward task, but when you have several farms of <a id="_idIndexMarker710"/>servers with thousands of servers running a plurality of OSes, then this becomes very complex.</p>
			<p>While this task will be normally performed by the platform team, it's key that you understand how it works for the following reasons:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>There will be cases where you will have to be in charge of managing the updates.</li>
				<li>This knowledge will allow you to better adjust your defensive strategy accordingly.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Now, let's take a look at how updates can be deployed.</p>
			<h3>Windows Server Update Services </h3>
			<p><strong class="bold">Windows Server Update Services</strong> (<strong class="bold">WSUS</strong>) enables you to<a id="_idIndexMarker711"/> manage and distribute the latest Microsoft product updates through a management console.</p>
			<p>Basically, the WSUS server will enable you to do the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Centralize update management</li>
				<li>Update management automation</li>
			</ul>
			<p>You can see an overview of the different server roles available in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_6.6_B16290.jpg" alt="Figure 6.6 – Installing WSUS as a Windows server role&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.6 – Installing WSUS as a Windows server role</p>
			<p>As seen in the preceding screenshot, WSUS is a built-in server role. An interesting fact is that you can have as many WSUS servers as you want in your infrastructure, but at least one needs to connect to<a id="_idIndexMarker712"/> <strong class="bold">Microsoft Update</strong> to get available update information (this is called the <strong class="bold">upstream server</strong>).</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Tip</p>
			<p class="callout">Keep in<a id="_idIndexMarker713"/> mind <a id="_idIndexMarker714"/>that there are many <a id="_idIndexMarker715"/>other alternative <em class="italic">patch management tools</em> provided by third parties, such <a id="_idIndexMarker716"/>as <strong class="bold">SolarWinds Patch Manager</strong>, <strong class="bold">AutoPatcher</strong>, <strong class="bold">Kaseya VSA</strong>, <strong class="bold">ManageEngine Patch Connect Plus</strong>, <strong class="bold">Ivanti PatchLink</strong>, and <a id="_idIndexMarker717"/>more.</p>
			<p>WSUS has two main <a id="_idIndexMarker718"/>interfaces, a <strong class="bold">command-line interface</strong> (<strong class="bold">CLI</strong>) through <a id="_idIndexMarker719"/>PowerShell, and a built-in visual interface, as seen in the following screenshot, that provides a lot of information about the updates to be deployed in your infrastructure, the classification of those updates, and more:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_6.7_B16290.jpg" alt="Figure 6.7 – WSUS graphical user interface (GUI)&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.7 – WSUS graphical user interface (GUI)</p>
			<p>Now, deploying the updates is not as easy as just doing a single click. In fact, to avoid disruption, companies have a set of rules aimed to avoid the risk of disrupting some services during patching. This <a id="_idIndexMarker720"/>process is called <strong class="bold">change management</strong>.</p>
			<h3>Change management process</h3>
			<p>Big corporations <a id="_idIndexMarker721"/>cannot risk their businesses suffering because a failed installation of a patch crashed a server, causing millions of dollars in losses. Instead, they have a well-organized <em class="italic">change management process</em> that specifies when a server can be accessed for maintenance.</p>
			<p>Depending on the company, those <em class="italic">maintenance windows</em> can be done monthly or quarterly, and they are normally planned to be executed on a <em class="italic">time-boxed</em> period that includes a <strong class="bold">time-to-recovery</strong> (<strong class="bold">TTR</strong>) window<a id="_idIndexMarker722"/> to restore the systems back to their original state in the case of issues.</p>
			<p>OS updates are normally installed during these maintenance windows, so it's critical that you become familiar with the change management process to ensure that critical updates are installed on the upcoming maintenance window.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-137"><a id="_idTextAnchor141"/>Types of patches</h2>
			<p>Let's review the <a id="_idIndexMarker723"/>different types of updates available for Windows-based systems. </p>
			<p>Take into consideration that to help you prioritize the deployment, they include a categorization based on importance (from a cybersecurity point of view). </p>
			<p>The categories are <strong class="bold">Critical</strong> (meaning they must be installed ASAP), <strong class="bold">Required</strong> (must be prioritized on the upcoming patching window), and <strong class="bold">Minor</strong> (optional updates). These updates are explained in more detail here:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Update</strong>: A fix to a <a id="_idIndexMarker724"/>specific problem that is considered non-critical, such as a non-security-related bug. Since a lack of this update will not impact the performance or security of the server, these updates are considered of <em class="italic">minor</em> importance.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Critical update</strong>: This aims to<a id="_idIndexMarker725"/> fix a specific <em class="italic">non-security-related</em> bug. Normally, this is released to a wide audience of users. Even if this is not security-related, it may fix some issues related to performance and stability, and therefore this should be considered <em class="italic">critical</em>. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Definition update</strong>: This is <a id="_idIndexMarker726"/>normally a software update that contains additions to a product's definition database. As seen in the following screenshot, these definition databases are often to prevent attacks resulting from malicious code, phishing websites, or junk mail:</li>
			</ul>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_6.8_B16290.jpg" alt="Figure 6.8 – Windows definition updates&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.8 – Windows definition updates</p>
			<p>Since some of them<a id="_idIndexMarker727"/> could prevent some known security attack vectors, they are considered a <em class="italic">critical</em> update.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Security update</strong>: This <a id="_idIndexMarker728"/>update aims to fix a product-specific, security-related vulnerability.<p>Normally, those vulnerabilities are rated by their severity as critical, important, moderate, or low, as indicated in the Microsoft security bulletin.</p><p class="callout-heading">Tip</p><p class="callout">Windows security updates come with two important documents that give a lot of information about the vulnerability. They are the <em class="italic">security bulletin</em> and a <em class="italic">Microsoft Knowledge Base article</em>, and they provide very useful insights about the vulnerability being fixed.</p></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Driver</strong>: Sometimes, Windows <a id="_idIndexMarker729"/>provides updates to its catalog of built-in drivers (basic drivers) to improve or fix some functionalities. As seen in the following screenshot, sometimes these updates are considered by the OS as optional drivers as they may not apply to all users:</li>
			</ul>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_6.9_B16290.jpg" alt="Figure 6.9 – Windows driver updates&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.9 – Windows driver updates</p>
			<p>Considering that a lack of this update will not jeopardize the integrity or current functionalities of the systems, they are considered <em class="italic">minor</em>.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Feature pack</strong>: <em class="italic">New product functionality</em> that is distributed to users before the upcoming full product release. Since<a id="_idIndexMarker730"/> these updates are related to <em class="italic">new functionality</em> and not to prevent or fix a given issue or bug, they are considered <em class="italic">minor</em> updates. </li>
				<li>Here is a screenshot of <strong class="bold">Feature Updates</strong> on Windows:</li>
			</ul>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_6.10_B16290.jpg" alt="Figure 6.10 – Windows feature updates&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.10 – Windows feature updates</p>
			<p>As seen in the preceding screenshot, when <strong class="bold">Feature Updates</strong> is installed, there will be a link where you can see details of the new features included on that update.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Service pack</strong>: Microsoft <a id="_idIndexMarker731"/>does a very good job of releasing updates for its systems, but that means that over time, there could be a lot of updates available for a given OS. Therefore, once there are a certain number of tested hotfixes, updates, security updates, and critical updates, they are packed into a service pack.<p>Service packs<a id="_idIndexMarker732"/> may also contain other updates, including customer-requested design changes or features.</p><p>Service packs are a major update of the OS, so it is highly recommended to test it first on a testing environment before massively deploying them into production servers.</p><p>Since they include critical updates for OS stability and security, they are considered <em class="italic">critical </em>updates.</p></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Update rollup/monthly rollup</strong>: A collection of hotfixes, security updates, critical updates, and updates that are packaged together for easy deployment. This is basically a smaller <a id="_idIndexMarker733"/>version of a service pack. The update rollup is normally<a id="_idIndexMarker734"/> a compilation based on the same feature, while the monthly rollup is based on the month when the updates were released. Since they include critical updates for OS stability and security, they are considered critical.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Now you have mastered everything there is to know about Windows updates, it is time to move to the next topic to learn more about <em class="italic">how to secure AD</em>.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-138"><a id="_idTextAnchor142"/>Applying security to AD </h1>
			<p>While there is<a id="_idIndexMarker735"/> not an official guideline or standard for securing AD, here is a <a id="_idIndexMarker736"/>compilation of the <em class="italic">industry best practices</em> that you can leverage to enhance the security of your AD servers:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Never install additional software, roles, or services on domain controllers.</li>
				<li>Never create local users on domain controllers (user management must be carefully handled on domain controllers).</li>
				<li>Make sure accounts are created based on PoLP.</li>
				<li>Maintain a record (list) of AD privilege accounts that includes owners, rights, and other relevant data about the account (to prevent ghost accounts).<p class="callout-heading">Tip</p><p class="callout"><strong class="bold">Ghost account</strong> is a<a id="_idIndexMarker737"/> term used for accounts in which the ownership or usage is unclear. While this may not be an issue on small infrastructures, it can become a huge problem in big environments in which best practices are not followed and you may have dozens of those accounts, which represents a significant risk to your infrastructure.</p></li>
				<li>AD privilege <a id="_idIndexMarker738"/>accounts should not be used to log in to workstations (this increases the risk of the account being compromised).</li>
				<li>Avoid keeping <a id="_idIndexMarker739"/>AD privilege accounts as disabled (the best practice is to remove privilege accounts if they are not in use).</li>
				<li>All logs should be enabled.</li>
				<li>Installation of security updates must be prioritized on domain servers.</li>
				<li>As mentioned earlier, the latest version of Windows Server normally contains a new set of security features, so when possible, use the latest version of Windows Server to host the domain controller.</li>
				<li>Enable <strong class="bold">multi-factor authentication</strong> (<strong class="bold">MFA</strong>) when <a id="_idIndexMarker740"/>possible.</li>
				<li>Perform regular reviews (audits) of AD privilege accounts.<p class="callout-heading">Tip</p><p class="callout">You must ensure you especially protect the three built-in groups in AD that possess the highest privilege groups in the directory (enterprise admins, domain admins, and administrators).</p></li>
				<li>Perform regular backups.</li>
				<li>Ensure <strong class="bold">high availability</strong> (<strong class="bold">HA</strong>) by <a id="_idIndexMarker741"/>configuring failover clustering. You can<a id="_idIndexMarker742"/> read more on this at <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/failover-clustering/failover-clustering-overview">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/failover-clustering/failover-clustering-overview</a>.</li>
				<li>Avoid permanent membership in highly privileged groups. Instead, grant temporary membership only when needed.</li>
				<li>When <em class="italic">creating custom groups</em>, make sure you label them with specific, self-explanatory names—for example, <em class="italic">IT-Helpdesk</em> instead of <em class="italic">Group-x031</em>.</li>
				<li>SMB version 1 <a id="_idIndexMarker743"/>must be disabled. This can be disabled using the<a id="_idIndexMarker744"/> Windows Registry or, as seen in the following screenshot, this can also be disabled/verified using the GUI for turning on/off Windows features:</li>
			</ul>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_6.11_B16290.jpg" alt="Figure 6.11 – Windows Features &#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.11 – Windows Features </p>
			<p>Additionally, most organizations need to perform administrative tasks on AD but from another computer—for example, IT support people doing password resets, or network admins<a id="_idIndexMarker745"/> doing <strong class="bold">Domain Name System</strong> (<strong class="bold">DNS</strong>) changes. </p>
			<p>These systems are<a id="_idIndexMarker746"/> known as <strong class="bold">secure administrative hosts</strong>, and we will now look at some security best practices that must be applied to them.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-139"><a id="_idTextAnchor143"/>Secure administrative hosts</h2>
			<p>As mentioned, <strong class="bold">secure administrative hosts</strong> are systems (workstations or servers) from which privileged <a id="_idIndexMarker747"/>accounts can perform administrative tasks in AD. </p>
			<p>Here are some best practices about how you can configure them as a secure platform:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Enable MFA in those systems.</li>
				<li>Review the physical security of those systems to ensure they are in a secure zone.</li>
				<li>Restrict permissions and prevent the installation of any additional software.</li>
				<li>Avoid the installation and usage of email on those systems.</li>
				<li>Microsoft even recommends avoiding the installation of Office on these systems.</li>
				<li>They <em class="italic">must</em> run supported and fully patched OSes.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Universal Serial Bus</strong> (<strong class="bold">USB</strong>) ports should be disabled.</li>
				<li>When possible, media readers (<strong class="bold">Digital Video Disc</strong> (<strong class="bold">DVD</strong>), <strong class="bold">Standard Definition</strong> (<strong class="bold">SD</strong>), and so on) must be removed or disconnected.</li>
				<li>Autorun must be disabled.</li>
				<li>Make sure that the security features of the secure administrative hosts are equal to the domain controller.</li>
				<li>Internet browsing must be disabled.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Also, when possible, use VMs as secure administrative hosts. First, they can be easily turned off when not in use, and secondly, you can configure them to reset to a default snapshot after each use to keep the system clean.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-140"><a id="_idTextAnchor144"/>Windows Server Security documentation</h2>
			<p>Here, you can find additional <a id="_idIndexMarker748"/>documentation (including videos) about the several layers of protection built into the OS to keep the servers protected against security breaches and malicious attacks, and to overall keep the data and infrastructure secure: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/security/security-and-assurance.</p>
			<p>Now that you have learned everything there is to know about <strong class="bold">Windows Server Security</strong>, it's time to start learning about how to enhance the security of all your <strong class="bold">Windows workstations</strong> in your infrastructure.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-141"><a id="_idTextAnchor145"/>Mastering endpoint security </h1>
			<p>Most of the <a id="_idIndexMarker749"/>best practices that we reviewed for servers are also applicable to workstations, so instead of repeating them, let's review some additional security mechanisms and tools that are specifically applicable to workstations.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-142"><a id="_idTextAnchor146"/>Windows updates</h2>
			<p>We already talked about the<a id="_idIndexMarker750"/> importance of patching the OS; however, I want to highlight that you can leverage WSUS to distribute updates to your workstations. Here is a<a id="_idIndexMarker751"/> great step-by-step guide created by Microsoft that shows you how to configure it: <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/deployment/update/waas-manage-updates-wsus">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/deployment/update/waas-manage-updates-wsus</a>.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-143"><a id="_idTextAnchor147"/>Why move to Windows 10?</h2>
			<p>As mentioned, there are <a id="_idIndexMarker752"/>many reasons to keep your systems running the latest versions of the OS, but here, we are going to highlight some additional aspects to consider about why it would be a good idea to migrate to Windows 10.</p>
			<h3>Windows as a service</h3>
			<p>In the past, Microsoft released <a id="_idIndexMarker753"/>new versions of Windows every few years, which represented some challenges for IT professionals in terms of planning and deployment.</p>
			<p>Now, the new Windows 10 was created based on a concept called Windows as a service, which means that instead of creating a new version of Windows (Windows 11), Microsoft will just keep providing upgrades to Windows 10 through two release types: <strong class="bold">Feature Updates</strong>, which add new functionality twice per year, and <strong class="bold">Quality Updates</strong>, which provide security and reliability fixes at least once a month.</p>
			<p>So, with this new approach, Microsoft plans to simplify the lives of IT pros and maintain a consistent Windows 10 experience for its customers while ensuring their systems have the latest security features and updates.</p>
			<p>For additional information<a id="_idIndexMarker754"/> about this new model, please visit the official site at <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/deployment/update/waas-overview">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/deployment/update/waas-overview</a>.</p>
			<h3>Windows 10 security options</h3>
			<p>There are <a id="_idIndexMarker755"/>many <em class="italic">security policy settings</em> that allow you to configure the behavior of a Windows 10 machine. They can be either configured locally or in a <strong class="bold">Group Policy Object</strong> (<strong class="bold">GPO</strong>) to all<a id="_idIndexMarker756"/> devices that are subject to that GPO.</p>
			<p>It is key that you become familiar with those policy settings and adjust them based on the organizational security policies. Here, you can find a list of all security policy settings that includes a brief <a id="_idIndexMarker757"/>description and also the recommended settings: <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/security-options">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/security-options</a>.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-144"><a id="_idTextAnchor148"/>Physical security</h2>
			<p>Physical security is <a id="_idIndexMarker758"/>one of the most important aspects of endpoint security, so here, we will take a look at some minimal recommendations that you need to enforce to ensure you keep your systems safe and secure.</p>
			<p>As mentioned in <a href="B16290_02_Final_JC_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor035"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>, <em class="italic">Managing Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Risks</em>, there are a lot of vulnerabilities related to USB ports that are currently present on most computers as they leverage the inherited trust that <a id="_idIndexMarker759"/>a computer has on <strong class="bold">Human Interface Devices</strong> (<strong class="bold">HID</strong>) devices (keyboard and mouse). Therefore, we need to ensure that <em class="italic">USB ports are not physically reachable to external users (mostly for users who are in customer service roles or any other client-facing role)</em>.</p>
			<p>Additionally, you must put in place a plurality of mechanisms to prevent the robbery of computers, and we will review them in depth in <a href="B16290_09_Final_JC_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor213"><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em></a>,<em class="italic"> Deep Diving into Physical Security</em>.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-145"><a id="_idTextAnchor149"/>Antivirus solutions</h2>
			<p>This is a basic cybersecurity component that you already know about, so there is no need to spend<a id="_idIndexMarker760"/> much time on this section. Instead, let's just summarize some rules about the use of antivirus solutions, as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Use the same antivirus solution across the organization.</li>
				<li>Prevent the installation of additional antivirus solutions (using technical and administrative controls).</li>
				<li>Prevent the disabling or uninstallation of corporate antivirus solutions. When possible, this action should flag an alert to the IT security team and management (this works as a very good dissuasive component).</li>
				<li>Consider Windows Defender as a great corporate antivirus solution.</li>
				<li>Keep automatic updates always on (the only exception is when you manage the deployment of updates using an internal server).<p class="callout-heading">Tip</p><p class="callout">Administrative controls are all those controls based on rules, policies, and regulations. Normally, they are enforced through audits, penalties, or <strong class="bold">human resources</strong> (<strong class="bold">HR</strong>) actions. On the <a id="_idIndexMarker761"/>other hand, technical controls are all those controls that you can track and enforce by using technology components, such as <strong class="bold">intrusion prevention systems</strong> (<strong class="bold">IPS</strong>), <strong class="bold">intrusion detection systems</strong> (<strong class="bold">IDS</strong>), firewalls, and antivirus <a id="_idIndexMarker762"/>solutions.</p></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Keep in mind that there is no perfect antivirus solution. I think that over time, you will have your own preferences, which can also be based on need; for example, you may like one antivirus solution for your personal use but may have a different preference for corporate use (because of advanced tools such as deployment options, alerts, and the admin console).</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-146"><a id="_idTextAnchor150"/>Windows Defender Firewall</h2>
			<p>Having <strong class="bold">Windows Defender Firewall</strong> <a id="_idIndexMarker763"/>on is a good idea as it serves as an additional layer of security. As mentioned with antivirus solutions, you must put in some administrative and technical controls to prevent and detect whether someone disables it.</p>
			<p>As you can see in the following screenshot, you can configure the firewall locally on each workstation or manage it via <strong class="bold">Group Policy</strong>. Additionally, you can also see how it has several profiles depending on the network connected.</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_6.12_B16290.jpg" alt="Figure 6.12 – Windows Firewall configuration&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.12 – Windows Firewall configuration</p>
			<p>Another common issue is that when there are network issues, the IT helpdesk could disable the Windows Defender Firewall as a temporary fix; however, you need to create a policy with them to prevent that practice and instead encourage them to perform a <strong class="bold">root cause analysis</strong> (<strong class="bold">RCA</strong>) to<a id="_idIndexMarker764"/> determine the real cause of the issue without impacting the security of the device.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-147"><a id="_idTextAnchor151"/>Application control</h2>
			<p>Here, you may face two <a id="_idIndexMarker765"/>possibilities: you either remove user permissions to install apps or implement technical controls to monitor the apps installed by the user. Both options have their pros and cons—for example, restricting user permissions may be the easiest way for you from the security side; however, that will significantly impact the number of helpdesk tickets related to users needing access to install an application (due to business needs). On the other side, if you grant admin rights to all users, you will have a higher risk in terms of security that you must mitigate by implementing additional security controls.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-148"><a id="_idTextAnchor152"/>URL filtering</h2>
			<p>You can apply <strong class="bold">Uniform Resource Locator</strong> (<strong class="bold">URL</strong>) filtering<a id="_idIndexMarker766"/> to prevent users from accessing dangerous sites or sites that may impact your network bandwidth. Even if this sounds like a joke, a lot of employees access streaming sites or apps to watch movies <em class="italic">when connected to the corporate network</em>, so this also needs to be prevented because first, most free streaming sites are full of malware but also, that may impact the availability and bandwidth of your network.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-149"><a id="_idTextAnchor153"/>Spam filtering</h2>
			<p>I know this is super <a id="_idIndexMarker767"/>basic, but since this is also super important, please remember that besides being configured on the email server, you can also add an extra security layer by using the spam filter that is included on most email clients.</p>
			<p>Also, you can create some rules to prevent some other email attacks. For example, as seen in the following screenshot, you can configure your email to automatically tag external emails (for example, by adding the word <strong class="bold">EXTERNAL</strong> to the email title). This simple action will prevent spoofing and phishing attacks.</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_6.13_B16290.jpg" alt="Figure 6.13 – Automatic tagging of external emails&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.13 – Automatic tagging of external emails</p>
			<p>For example, you <a id="_idIndexMarker768"/>can easily do this by creating a rule in Office 365 or the exchange server. Where you just need to create a new rule, select to apply that to all emails from outside the organization, select to whom it should be applied, select the action (in this case, <strong class="bold">Apply disclaimer to the message</strong>), and you are done! Trust me—those very simple steps will save you a lot of headaches.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-150"><a id="_idTextAnchor154"/>Client-facing systems</h2>
			<p>Depending on your business, you<a id="_idIndexMarker769"/> may have systems that will be accessed by external users (for example, a computer for users to do some self-service operation). Those systems must be isolated from your network (if possible, with their own internet connection). But also, they must be secure to protect your customers from attacks. Here, the best recommendation is to install software that restores the system to an initial state after it is rebooted (such as Deep Freeze). To increase the level of security (for example, in financial institutions), you can perform rollback after each user uses the system. </p>
			<p>Also, the case (depending on the country, they can be named <strong class="bold">CPU</strong>, tower, and so on) of these computers must be isolated from the user, and just the keyboard, screen, and mouse should be accessible to users (to prevent the connection of dangerous devices such as keyloggers).</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-151"><a id="_idTextAnchor155"/>Backups</h2>
			<p>You must ensure that users are<a id="_idIndexMarker770"/> provided with a backup solution that is preinstalled and configured in all workstations.</p>
			<p>Also, you need to make sure to create at least a yearly campaign to educate users about the importance of backups, the tools available, and the tools that are not approved for use.</p>
			<p>This is extremely important for two reasons: first, you need to make sure all users have a backup solution available to keep a secure copy of their files in the case of disaster, but also, you must prevent users from using insecure mechanisms for backups—for example, non-approved cloud solutions or external USB drives.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Tip</p>
			<p class="callout">It does not matter if you did several awareness campaigns—rest assured that if someone loses their data (because of not having a backup), you will be the first to be blamed. So, to prevent this kind of situation, you must ensure that the backup policy states: <em class="italic">Performing periodical backups and testing them is a user responsibility</em>. You can also mention: <em class="italic">in the case of errors, it is the user's responsibility to report that to the IT security department by using the official (predetermined) channel</em>.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-152"><a id="_idTextAnchor156"/>Users</h2>
			<p>We dedicated all of <a href="B16290_04_Final_JC_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor092"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></a>,<em class="italic"> Patching Layer 8,</em> to talking about users; however, there are some extra steps that we need to consider related to some vulnerabilities that may be introduced by<a id="_idIndexMarker771"/> users, as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Users' personal devices</strong>: You need to implement the necessary technical and administrative controls to prevent the connection of users' personal devices (including <strong class="bold">Internet of Things</strong> (<strong class="bold">IoT</strong>) devices) to your corporate network.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Peripherals</strong>: Any additional device connected to your infrastructure represents an additional risk, so to prevent those risks, you must restrict the use of personal peripherals on corporate endpoints. From printers to USB keyboards, both can represent a security vulnerability, and therefore their usage and installation in a corporate environment must be limited. This can be achieved by a clear user policy, plus some technical controls, to prevent or alert in the case of the installation of personal peripherals.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-153"><a id="_idTextAnchor157"/>Securing the data</h2>
			<p>A stolen laptop can be<a id="_idIndexMarker772"/> easily replaced; however, the exposure of sensitive corporate information, such as intellectual capital or trade secrets, may be fatal for a company and, in some cases, may lead to bankruptcy. Therefore, securing the data should be your priority, and encrypting your data is a great way to do it.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-154"><a id="_idTextAnchor158"/>Leveraging encryption </h1>
			<p>As a first step, you need <a id="_idIndexMarker773"/>to understand the applicable regulations and laws to determine whether some specific encryption requirements apply to your organization (or a part of it). For example, the following screenshot shows the different encryption<a id="_idIndexMarker774"/> requirements between the <strong class="bold">Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard</strong> (<strong class="bold">PCI DSS</strong>) and <a id="_idIndexMarker775"/>the <strong class="bold">Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act</strong> (<strong class="bold">HIPAA</strong>):</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_6.14_B16290.jpg" alt="Figure 6.14 – PCI and HIPAA encryption requirements&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.14 – PCI and HIPAA encryption requirements</p>
			<p>However, you should not create your encryption policy based only on compliance requirements. Instead, you should create a <em class="italic">robust encryption policy</em> based on the following considerations:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Implement full disk encryption (for example, BitLocker).</li>
				<li>Implement email encryption.</li>
				<li>Implement file-level encryption (for sensitive data).</li>
				<li>Encrypt backups.</li>
				<li>Create awareness campaigns to show the importance of encryption and why it must be applied at all levels (data at rest, in transit, and so on).</li>
				<li>Require encryption as part of the requirements in your <strong class="bold">bring your own device</strong> (<strong class="bold">BYOD</strong>) policy.</li>
				<li>Encrypt data in transit by implementing a VPN.</li>
				<li>Make sure you implement <strong class="bold">Secure Sockets Layer</strong> (<strong class="bold">SSL</strong>) on your web pages to encrypt data.</li>
				<li>Ensure that your <a id="_idIndexMarker776"/>communication tools (including corporate chat) enable <strong class="bold">peer-to-peer</strong> (<strong class="bold">P2P</strong>) encryption.</li>
				<li>Implement a key management solution (such as <strong class="bold">Azure Key Vault</strong>) to safeguard cryptographic keys and secrets that cloud applications and services use.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Windows-based systems have a built-in option to encrypt the hard drive. Additionally, advanced versions of Windows 10 came with a tool called <strong class="bold">BitLocker</strong> to configure encryption settings (including full drive encryption).</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-155"><a id="_idTextAnchor159"/>Configuring BitLocker</h2>
			<p>To enable it, just<a id="_idIndexMarker777"/> type <code>Manage BitLocker</code> in the Windows search box of the start up menu to access the management console, in which you can turn <strong class="bold">Windows BitLocker</strong> on or off.</p>
			<p>Some versions of Windows (such as the Home version) may not have <strong class="bold">Windows BitLocker</strong>; instead, they will have a simplified system for device encryption. To enable this, you need to go to <strong class="bold">Start</strong> | <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> | <strong class="bold">Update &amp; Security</strong> | <strong class="bold">Device encryption</strong>. If this is not listed there, it means that device encryption is unavailable on that version of Windows. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-156"><a id="_idTextAnchor160"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we learned about the best practices and strategies for Windows servers and also when to apply them. After that, you learned how to create a hardening checklist for Window Server, which will be of great value for us and the teams in charge of server management.</p>
			<p>Additionally, we reviewed all different types of patches for Windows systems and their importance in terms of cybersecurity. Then, you learned how to create a patching strategy to keep your infrastructure safe. We also reviewed a great collection of best practices to keep your AD secure.</p>
			<p>Finally, we looked at the most important practices to keep your Windows workstations secure, including how to leverage encryption to increase the level of security of your overall infrastructure.</p>
			<p>Now that you have become a master in all aspects of Windows security, it's time to understand everything there is to know about hardening Unix servers, which will be covered in the next chapter.</p>
