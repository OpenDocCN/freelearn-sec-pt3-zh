    phones and other handheld devices—often considered to be rich sources of digital
    evidence. The processes of locating and recovering digital evidence relating to
    records of personal communications, including e-mails and browsing records stored
    in computer devices and telephonic communications stored on mobile phones, are
    described. You will appreciate the value of locating, extracting, and examining
    records of communications between persons of interest stored on computer and mobile
    phones that are often a rich source of evidence.

    stored as cookies, cache files, URL history, search terms, histories, and other
    files on the computer. This forms an important part of many forensic examinations,
    as it can help reconstruct a suspect's online browsing behavior in relation to
    cases such as infringements of intellectual property, cybercrime and child pornography,
    and other serious crimes. The following subsections describe some of the basic
    features of web-browsing events that assist in crime reconstruction. They also
    outline the recovery of evidence from browser data, which may be done from unallocated
    space as well, providing the practitioner with an insight into private browsing
    activities.

    anything that the searcher is looking for. During the process of visiting or linking
    to a remote site, there is, as per *Locard''s exchange principle*, some exchange
    of data: traces are left behind and some are transferred to another device. The
    remote website may record some details of user visits to a varying extent. Web-based
    e-mail servers such as Hotmail and Yahoo! would log account holders and often
    record their IP addresses at the point of accessing their accounts. This information
    is useful in reconstructing transgressions, even more so if they correlate with
    the device used by the account holder to sign in to an account.'

    machines, so it is unlikely that much e-mail evidence will be recovered from these
    accounts, other than what may be in the transient RAM state. However, such e-mail
    accounts can now be synchronized and backed up into a **Post Office Protocol**
    (**POP**) client, a standard protocol to retrieve and manage messages from remote
    servers over an Internet connection. This results in messages being downloaded
    and stored on the local machine. Windows 10 e-mail messaging similarly caches
    these messages on the local drive, thereby potentially assisting forensic recovery.

- en: Private browsing is a facility provided by some web browsers, including Google
    Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Internet Explorer, for the purpose of avoiding all
    traces of the user's activity during a browsing session for privacy and, possibly,
    security reasons. It is also typical of users wishing to hide browsing activities
    that involve a degree of illegality. This makes the analysis and location of evidence
    relating to web browsing activity potentially difficult, as the private browsing
    may have removed all evidence of browsing activities that may be relevant to an
    examination.

    of the private browsing function and its implications for forensic examination.
    Previous research had looked at recovering browsing data from computer hard drives,
    while other research stressed the wisdom of recording browsing activities from
    RAM data stored on the computer. A range of forensic programs used for the analysis
    of web browsers, including EnCase, AccessData's Forensic Toolkit, Nirsoft Internet
    Tools, and Internet Evidence Finder, had been used in earlier experiments.

- en: My experiments were intended to identify those areas of the computer system
    that are modified or accessed during normal and private browsing sessions. This
    showed that during private browsing, IE stored everything normally but deleted
    it once the browser was exited. Chrome modified the safe browsing databases, cookies,
    and history, and Firefox modified the Firefox profiles and safe browsing database.
    These results could potentially help researchers focus their search when analyzing
    web browsers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Some variances were noted in whether `pagefile.sys` files contained information
    relevant to private browsing, but that may have been due to the size of RAM available,
    as memory swap files are created when the memory is fully used, storing data on
    the hard drive. This seems more of a matter of chance than something that can
    be relied upon during a dead analysis of the hard drive, with the chance of finding
    them decreasing as time and computer use after the session increases.

    found browsing information in both the usual folders and unallocated space. These
    differences in locations where browsing artifacts were found may be due to system,
    web browser version, or forensic analysis software differences. This study also
    found that there were differences between the number of artifacts that could be
    recovered after a private browsing session in Internet Explorer. This appeared
    to depend on the different process used to access files in private browsing, with
    fewer artifacts recovered when Internet Explorer was opened directly in InPrivate

    In addition to a growing variety of smartphones and platforms, including Android,

    **International Mobile Station Equipment Identity** (**IMEI**) to uniquely identify
    a broad range of mobile phones. The unique number is normally printed inside the
    battery compartment or on the outside casing of the phone. It is also stored inside
    the embedded memory of the phone and, from there, may be displayed on the screen
    and recovered using forensic tools. The IMEI identifies and validates the phone
    hardware to a GSM network to prevent stolen phones from accessing that network.
    The IMEI is an important record of a phone's use and identity.

    can store, on average holding a mere 32 to 64 gigabytes of data. The deletion
    processes on these drives use wear leveling to ensure efficient removal of data
    in order to maximize the life of the drive. That means that although deleted data
    may not be evident, it may persist longer on the device, potentially offering
    more chance of recovery using a physical dump of the deleted sectors. Conversely,
    the wear leveling and delete feature tends to activate when the phone is switched
    on and therefore this should be avoided post seizure. Physical extractions from
    Android phones and iPhones have been thwarted by the security of the devices and
