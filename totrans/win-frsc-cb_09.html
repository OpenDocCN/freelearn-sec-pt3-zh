<p>Accessing a suspect's communications via email and instant messengers will help you to solve lots of cases; and you will be asked to find and extract such artifacts very often. It doesn't matter if the case is a phishing attack, intellectual property theft, or a terrorist act - a computer forensic examiner must be able to locate, parse, and analyze a suspect's digital communications.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we will show you how to parse and analyze artifacts from the most common Windows email clients - Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird, and Skype instant messenger.</p>

<p>Intella is a very powerful digital forensic and eDiscovery tool capable of processing, searching, and analyzing <strong>Electronically Stored Information</strong> (<strong>ESI</strong>). One of its main features is visual analytics. This feature can help an examiner to understand <span>the ESI and custodian relationships better. In this recipe, we will show you how to parse an Outlook mailbox with this tool.</span></p>

<p>If you don't have a valid Intella license, you can get a free 14-day trial version from Vound Software's website (check the <em>See also</em> section). You will also need a <kbd>PST</kbd> or <kbd>OST</kbd> file to follow this recipe. It's easy to get one: simply use your own email address with Outlook, then go to <kbd>C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Outlook</kbd> and get your file. This will be your evidence source, in our case an <kbd>OST</kbd> file.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox"><span>PST files are used for POP3, IMAP, and web-based mail accounts, while OST files are used when a user has an Exchange account and wants to work offline.</span></div>

<p>We can start the process by following the given steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Start by creating a new case. To do this, run Intella (you'll see Intella Case Manager), type your name (in our case it's <kbd>Test</kbd>), and click the <span class="packt_screen">Add...</span> button, as shown in the following figure:</li>

<p>Thunderbird is a free and open source mail client from Mozilla, the developers of the Firefox browser. If a user doesn't use Outlook, they are likely to use Thunderbird. In this recipe, we will show you how to extract data from Thunderbird MBOX files with a free and open source digital forensics platform — <strong>Autopsy</strong>.</p>

<p>Thunderbird stores mail data in MBOX files. These files can be found at the following location:</p>
<p><kbd>C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird\Profiles</kbd></p>
<p>Here you will find a user profile folder, which can be exported and processed with a piece of forensic software, in our case Autopsy.</p>
<p>Of course, you can use the whole forensic image for processing, but if you use only the profile folder, it saves you a lot of time.</p>
<p>Get a Thunderbird profile folder or a forensic image, and start Autopsy. If you haven't installed it already, use the download link in the 'See also' section.</p>

<li>It's time to choose Ingest Modules. We highly recommend always choosing the <strong><span class="packt_screen">Keyword Search</span></strong> module, as this is very helpful. Of course, this time make sure <strong><span class="packt_screen">Email Parser</span></strong> is ticked.</li>

<p>As you may know, some people (including the authors) use only webmail and no mail clients. Is it possible to recover such forensic artifacts from a drive image? The answer is - yes! And in this recipe, we will show you how to recover webmail activity with Oleg's favorite digital forensic tool - Magnet AXIOM.</p>

<p>We are sure that you already have AXIOM installed on your workstation. So run the tool and create a new case. Now, the most interesting thing is the evidence source. If you have already walked through the recipe <em>Extracting Web Browser Data from Pagefile.sys</em> in <a href="ec4705f6-5645-4d2c-b404-4e9cb9fd02c4.xhtml">Chapter 8</a>, <em>Web Browser Forensics,</em> you may guess what we are going to do next. Yes, webmail artifacts can be extracted from <kbd>pagefile.sys</kbd>, <kbd>swapfile.sys</kbd> and <kbd>hiberfil.sys</kbd>. So you can use one of these files as the data source, or the whole forensic image - AXIOM will find and parse data from these files automatically.</p>

<ol>
<li>Process your data source with AXIOM Process; don't forget to include <kbd>pagefile.sys</kbd> and <kbd>hiberfil.sys</kbd>, and make sure mail artifacts are checked. Once the processing phase is finished, go to AXIOM Examine and look at the <span class="packt_screen">EMAIL</span> section. Here you will find extracted email artifacts, including webmail, in our case Gmail, as shown in the following figure:</li>

<p>On modern Windows systems Skype is installed by default, so it's very important for a forensic examiner to extract user data from this application. This can be calls, messages, transferred or received files, and so on. In this recipe, we will show you how to parse these valuable artifacts with Belkasoft Evidence Center.</p>

<p>First of all, you should get a Skype profile folder. Again, you can use a forensic image, but to save time for testing purposes, we recommend using a profile folder as the data source. You can find Skype profile folders (yes, there can be more than one folder, as multiple accounts can be used on the same device) here:</p>
<p class="p1"><kbd>C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Roaming\Skype\</kbd></p>
<p>Once you get it, make sure Belkasoft Evidence Center (valid licence or trial) is installed on your workstation, and we are ready to start.</p>

<p>We can start the process by following the given steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a new case and add the profile folder you previously exported as the data source. Use <strong><span class="packt_screen">Selected folder</span></strong>, as shown in the following figure:</li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="475" width="503" class="image-border" src="assets/d3b81acb-3e56-4e1d-8e94-de64ed38d502.png"/></div>
<div class="mce-root CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Figure 9.17. Adding the data source in Belkasoft Evidence Center</div>
<ol start="2">
<li>Let's choose the right data type. We have a Skype profile folder, so go to <span class="packt_screen">Chats</span>, find <span class="packt_screen">Skype,</span> and tick it. Click <span class="packt_screen">Finish</span> and wait a bit for the data to be parsed, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>

<div class="mce-root CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Figure 9.18. Choosing data types in Belkasoft Evidence Center</div>
<ol start="3">
<li>Once the data is processed, you can work with the <span class="packt_screen">Overview</span> or <span class="packt_screen">Case Explorer</span> tabs to analyze the extracted data, including calls, messages (including voice), pictures, and so on. It's important to note that Belkasoft Evidence Center also extracts deleted messages from the Skype database (main.db), and analyzes <kbd>chatsync</kbd> files, which may include messages, that are not included in the main database.</li>
</ol>

<p>We can start the process by following the given steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Start the tool, and you will see a data source window, like the one in the following figure:</li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="159" width="485" class="image-border" src="assets/c7471c59-0502-4fa0-9bea-fbaa816b43ce.png"/></div>
<div class="mce-root CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Figure 9.19. Adding the data source in SkypeLogView</div>
<ol start="2">
<li>All you need now is to click <span class="packt_screen">OK</span> and the magic begins, as shown in the following figure:</li>
</ol>
<div class="mce-root CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="371" width="496" class=" image-border" src="assets/c12f2666-7b58-4e9e-8e58-c303f0de0c9a.png"/></div>
<ol start="3">
<li>Of course, you can sort the extracted data using different columns. If you want the timestamp to be displayed in GMT, go to <strong><span class="packt_screen">Options</span> - <span class="packt_screen">Show Time in GMT</span></strong>.</li>
<li>Finally, you can create an HTML report. To do this, go to <strong><span class="packt_screen">View</span> - <span class="packt_screen">HTML Report</span></strong>.</li>
</ol>

<p>SkypeLogView uses an examiner specified folder and extracts available Skype artifacts, such as chats, voicemails, calls, and so on. Also an examiner can create an HTML report for all or for user-selected artifacts.</p>
