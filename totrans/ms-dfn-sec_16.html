			<p><em class="italic">"In the midst of a disruptive and exponential rollout of the IV Industrial Revolution, more and more processes are being digitalized and robotized, and there is an explosion of data increasingly managed by artificial intelligence. In tandem with this rollout of new and enhanced IT capabilities, there are increased risks posed by cybercrime. Increased cybersecurity capabilities thus become one of the challenges to allow society to reap the benefits from the IV Industrial Revolution."</em></p>
			<p><em class="italic">– Ennio Rodriguez, Ph.D. in Economics and President of the Association of Economists of Costa Rica</em></p>
			<p>We have talked a lot about vulnerabilities throughout this book; however, this chapter was created as a single-point reference to this topic so that you can reach all the information you need about vulnerabilities in a single place.</p>
			<p>While <a href="B16290_02_Final_JC_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor035"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>, <em class="italic">Managing Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Risks</em>, described what vulnerabilities are and how to classify them, this chapter is more about how to identify those vulnerabilities once they are categorized.</p>
			<p>Therefore, we can say that while <a href="B16290_02_Final_JC_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor035"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>, <em class="italic">Managing Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Risks</em>, was the theoretical part of vulnerability management, this chapter is more about the practical/technical side, including a deep dive into the tools used to find those vulnerabilities in our systems and infrastructure.</p>
			<p>To achieve those goals, we will cover the following topics through this chapter:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>How to deal with vulnerabilities like a <strong class="bold">chief information security officer</strong> (<strong class="bold">CISO</strong>)</li>
				<li>Types of vulnerability testing tools</li>
				<li>Installing and configuring the most recognized vulnerability assessment scanner (<strong class="bold">Open Vulnerability Assessment System</strong>, also known as <strong class="bold">OpenVAS</strong>)</li>
				<li>An overview of <strong class="bold">Nexpose</strong> and other vulnerability scanners available</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-295"><a id="_idTextAnchor309"/>Technical requirements </h1>
			<p>To fully leverage the content of this chapter, it is recommended to have installed a <strong class="bold">virtual machine</strong> (<strong class="bold">VM</strong>) with <strong class="bold">Kali Linux</strong> to properly follow the labs.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-296"><a id="_idTextAnchor310"/>Dealing with vulnerabilities</h1>
			<p>As we<a id="_idIndexMarker1319"/> saw in <a href="B16290_02_Final_JC_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor035"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>, <em class="italic">Managing Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Risks</em>, there is a process to manage vulnerabilities at the company level that includes <em class="italic">identification</em>, <em class="italic">analysis</em>, <em class="italic">assessment</em>, and <em class="italic">remediation</em>.</p>
			<p>Now, that process is what we called the <em class="italic">management</em> side of the story. Now, it's time to understand how that is achieved from the <em class="italic">operational</em> (day-to-day) point of view. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-297"><a id="_idTextAnchor311"/>Who should be looking for vulnerabilities?</h2>
			<p>If you have <a id="_idIndexMarker1320"/>a large enough budget, you must assign this task to either internal or external (third-party) <strong class="bold">Red Teams</strong> (as explained in <a href="B16290_01_Final_JC_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor014"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a>, <em class="italic">A Refresher to Defensive Security Concepts</em>).</p>
			<p>On the other hand, if your budget is limited, you can encourage people within your company to report any vulnerability on your infrastructure. To make this effective, you must <em class="italic">establish</em> and <em class="italic">communicate</em> a <em class="italic">process</em> for that purpose and, when possible, provide incentives to the people that find and report those vulnerabilities.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-298"><a id="_idTextAnchor312"/>Bug bounty programs</h2>
			<p><strong class="bold">Bug bounty</strong> is a<a id="_idIndexMarker1321"/> clever idea to encourage others to tell you<a id="_idIndexMarker1322"/> about your vulnerabilities instead of exploiting them against you.</p>
			<p>The goal of this program is to <em class="italic">offer economic incentives</em> to external people who find unknown vulnerabilities in your web resources (apps, pages, and so on).</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Tip</p>
			<p class="callout">Bug bounty programs are more suitable for companies with high security standards and softwares that have already been tested and hardened by internal Red and Blue teams. Therefore, publishing a bug bounty of a recently created site that has not been properly hardened is a waste of resources.</p>
			<p>As mentioned, bug bounty programs are normally offered by strong companies who invested a lot of resources <a id="_idIndexMarker1323"/>on their platforms, so if you have very good pentesting skills, I highly<a id="_idIndexMarker1324"/> encourage you<a id="_idIndexMarker1325"/> to check these sites and learn more about these programs:</p>

				<li><a href="https://internetbugbounty.org/">https://internetbugbounty.org/</a></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Payment of bug bounty programs is normally classified based on the impact of the vulnerability found, which is tied to payment categories, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
			<p class="figure-caption"> </p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_13.1_B16290.jpg" alt="Figure 13.1 – Bug bounty payment example&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 13.1 – Bug bounty payment example</p>
			<p>However, this may raise the following question: </p>
			<p><em class="italic">Should I only check for vulnerabilities on external (internet-facing) systems and services?</em></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-299"><a id="_idTextAnchor313"/>Internal vulnerabilities</h2>
			<p>While<a id="_idIndexMarker1326"/> external-facing systems are more vulnerable to attacks, you are still in charge of the <em class="italic">overall security of your company data</em>, which means you also need to take care of the <em class="italic">availability</em> and the <em class="italic">integrity</em> of that data, and those two factors are especially vulnerable to insider attacks (either malicious or unintentional).</p>
			<p>Therefore, Red Teams should also perform testing on internal systems to ensure that the <strong class="bold">confidentiality</strong>, <strong class="bold">integrity</strong>, and <strong class="bold">availability</strong> of the data are preserved.</p>
			<p>Have a look at the following screenshot: </p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_13.2_B16290.jpg" alt="Figure 13.2 – Internal versus external testing programs&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 13.2 – Internal versus external testing programs</p>
			<p>As seen in the preceding screenshot, vulnerability testing programs can be supplemented to enhance the security of your systems by leveraging even external sources.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-300"><a id="_idTextAnchor314"/>Vulnerability testing tools</h2>
			<p>There are a <a id="_idIndexMarker1327"/>huge number of tools that can be used to perform vulnerability testing, and we can classify them into two main groups: <em class="italic">manual vulnerability assessment</em> and <em class="italic">automated vulnerability scanners</em>.</p>
			<h3>Manual vulnerability testing</h3>
			<p>You can <a id="_idIndexMarker1328"/>leverage many of the tools we have reviewed in <a id="_idIndexMarker1329"/>the <a id="_idIndexMarker1330"/>previous<a id="_idIndexMarker1331"/> chapters to manually<a id="_idIndexMarker1332"/> look for <a id="_idIndexMarker1333"/>vulnerabilities—for example, <strong class="bold">Burp Suite</strong>, <strong class="bold">Nmap</strong>, <strong class="bold">Wireshark</strong>, <strong class="bold">Shodan</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Web Scrappers</strong>.</p>
			<p>These types of testing require more technical skills and are normally done by cybersecurity experts or Red/Purple Teams.</p>
			<h3>Automated vulnerability scanners</h3>
			<p>These <a id="_idIndexMarker1334"/>scanners are created with the objective of making our lives easier by allowing us to scan a given web resource or system against one or more vulnerabilities with just a few steps—in fact, for most of them, with a single click.</p>
			<p>This allows an organization to scan their systems for complex vulnerabilities without the need of a pentester to perform the vulnerability assessment, making these scanners a more suitable option for companies with little budget to hire pentesters.</p>
			<p>Most of them <a id="_idIndexMarker1335"/>contain a database of known vulnerabilities (<strong class="bold">Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures</strong>, or <strong class="bold">CVE</strong>), plus an associated script to test each of them. In some cases, they even group those vulnerabilities <a id="_idIndexMarker1336"/>to allow users to determine whether the systems are compliant with a given compliance<a id="_idIndexMarker1337"/> requirement such as the <strong class="bold">Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard</strong> (<strong class="bold">PCI DSS</strong>) or the <strong class="bold">Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act</strong> (<strong class="bold">HIPAA</strong>). </p>
			<p>The following<a id="_idIndexMarker1338"/> screenshot shows the <strong class="bold">graphical user interface</strong> (<strong class="bold">GUI</strong>) of the Nessus vulnerability scanner:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_13.3_B16290.jpg" alt="Figure 13.3 – GUI of the Nessus vulnerability scanner&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 13.3 – GUI of the Nessus vulnerability scanner</p>
			<p>OK—now, let's<a id="_idIndexMarker1339"/> do a deep dive into two of the more famous vulnerability scanner tools: <strong class="bold">OpenVAS</strong> and <strong class="bold">Nexpose</strong>.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-301"><a id="_idTextAnchor315"/>Using a vulnerability assessment scanner (OpenVAS)</h1>
			<p><strong class="bold">OpenVAS</strong> is the <a id="_idIndexMarker1340"/>most famous open source vulnerability scanner available.</p>
			<p>The software is mainly maintained as an open source project by <em class="italic">Greenbone networks</em> (<a href="http://www.greenbone.net">www.greenbone.net</a>) as part of their commercial suite of a vulnerability management solution.</p>
			<p>This software is capable of testing an entire network to discover devices and then execute a plurality of actions to determine the <strong class="bold">Operating System (OS)</strong>, ports, configurations, and software installed on the systems, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_13.4_B16290.jpg" alt="Figure 13.4 – OpenVAS network scan structure&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 13.4 – OpenVAS network scan structure</p>
			<p>After that, OpenVAS<a id="_idIndexMarker1341"/> can execute several checks to identify vulnerabilities on each of the identified components. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-302"><a id="_idTextAnchor316"/>Authenticated tests</h2>
			<p>Part of the <a id="_idIndexMarker1342"/>powerful options of OpenVAS is the capability to perform two types of tests: unauthenticated and authenticated testing.</p>
			<p>An <em class="italic">unauthenticated test</em> is less invasive because it just tests general vulnerabilities based on the software, configuration, and ports found. </p>
			<p>On the other hand, an <em class="italic">authenticated test</em> is more powerful because it allows you to add another factor to the test—that is, the <em class="italic">user's session, authentication, and authorization</em>.</p>
			<p>Here, OpenVAS will use valid credentials (provided by the tester) to run <strong class="bold">local security checks</strong> (<strong class="bold">LSCs</strong>) to <a id="_idIndexMarker1343"/>gather more details about the vulnerabilities on the target systems.</p>
			<p>Examples of the credentials that <a id="_idIndexMarker1344"/>can be used in an authenticated test are given here:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Server Message Block (SMB)</strong>: To<a id="_idIndexMarker1345"/> check the patch level and locally installed software on Windows systems such as Adobe Acrobat Reader or the Java suite</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Secure Shell (SSH)</strong>: To <a id="_idIndexMarker1346"/>check the patch level on Unix and Linux systems</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">ESX integrated (ESXi)</strong>: To <a id="_idIndexMarker1347"/>test the VMware ESXi servers locally</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)</strong>: To test network components <a id="_idIndexMarker1348"/>such as routers and switches</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Now, let's<a id="_idIndexMarker1349"/> see how we can install this tool on our Kali Linux machine.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-303"><a id="_idTextAnchor317"/>Installing OpenVAS</h2>
			<p>OK—the first<a id="_idIndexMarker1350"/> step will be to download and install OpenVAS with the following command:</p>
			<pre>sudo apt-get install openvas</pre>
			<p>Once the software is installed, it's time to execute the configuration script with the following command:</p>
			<pre>sudo gvm-setup</pre>
			<p><em class="italic">Did you get an error?</em></p>
			<p>As seen in the following screenshot, there <a id="_idIndexMarker1351"/>is a common error related to <strong class="bold">postgresql</strong>, but we will see how to fix it:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_13.5_B16290.jpg" alt="Figure 13.5 – postgresql error&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 13.5 – postgresql error</p>
			<p>The error is caused because there are two versions of <strong class="bold">postgresql</strong> running at the same time and <strong class="bold">postgresql</strong> uses <strong class="bold">Transmission Control Protocol</strong> (<strong class="bold">TCP</strong>), and as you may know, it <a id="_idIndexMarker1352"/>cannot use the same port for both versions.</p>
			<p>Therefore, to fix this issue, we just need to make sure that version 13 is running on TCP <code>port 5432</code>, and then we can assign any other available port to version 12. Here is how to do it.</p>
			<p>Let's start by opening the configuration file for <code>postgresql 13</code>, as follows:</p>
			<pre>sudo nano /etc/postgresql/13/main/postgresql.conf</pre>
			<p>Here, you need to navigate to the port and change the current value to <code>5432</code>, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_13.6_B16290.jpg" alt="Figure 13.6 – Changing port on postgresql 13&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 13.6 – Changing port on postgresql 13</p>
			<p>Then, save the<a id="_idIndexMarker1353"/> file with <em class="italic">Ctrl</em> + <em class="italic">O</em> and exit with <em class="italic">Ctrl</em> + <em class="italic">X</em>, as seen in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_13.7_B16290.jpg" alt="Figure 13.7 – Saving the postgresql configuration file&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 13.7 – Saving the postgresql configuration file</p>
			<p>The next step is to modify the port in <code>postgresql</code> <code>12</code> and set the port to <code>5433</code>, as follows:</p>
			<pre>sudo nano /etc/postgresql/12/main/postgresql.conf</pre>
			<p>Then, as we did before, we need to change the port, this time from <code>5432</code> to <code>5433</code>, as seen in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_13.8_B16290.jpg" alt="Figure 13.8 – Changing the port on postgresql 12&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 13.8 – Changing the port on postgresql 12</p>
			<p>Then, save the<a id="_idIndexMarker1354"/> file with <em class="italic">Ctrl</em> + <em class="italic">O</em> and exit with <em class="italic">Ctrl</em> + <em class="italic">X</em>.</p>
			<p>Now, we just need to restart <strong class="bold">postgresql</strong> with the following command:</p>
			<pre>sudo systemctl restart postgresql</pre>
			<p>This should then fix the issue! </p>
			<p>Now, we can go back and run the OpenVAS configuration script, as follows:</p>
			<pre>sudo gvm-setup</pre>
			<p>Now, after a few minutes, you should see something like this:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_13.9_B16290.jpg" alt="Figure 13.9 – OpenVAS configuration and password&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 13.9 – OpenVAS configuration and password</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Tip</p>
			<p class="callout">Make sure you copy the password and save it in a safe location as you will need it to access OpenVAS.</p>
			<p>At this point, you are ready to start OpenVAS!</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-304"><a id="_idTextAnchor318"/>Using OpenVAS</h2>
			<p>To execute<a id="_idIndexMarker1355"/> OpenVAS, just type the following command:</p>
			<pre>sudo gvm-start</pre>
			<p>Notice that you can also start OpenVAS using the GUI of Kali Linux and browsing through the apps under <strong class="bold">02 - Vulnerability Analysis</strong>, as seen in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_13.10_B16290.jpg" alt="Figure 13.10 – Opening OpenVAS&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 13.10 – Opening OpenVAS</p>
			<p>In some cases, OpenVAS may not be able to open the default browser and will display the following error:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_13.11_B16290.jpg" alt="Figure 13.11 – OpenVAS configuration and password&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 13.11 – OpenVAS configuration and password</p>
			<p>But don't worry—in this case, you just need to copy the OpenVAS <strong class="bold">Uniform Resource Locator</strong> (<strong class="bold">URL</strong>) from <a id="_idIndexMarker1356"/>the command line (as seen in the following screenshot) and paste it into your favorite web browser:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_13.12_B16290.jpg" alt="Figure 13.12 – OpenVAS URL&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 13.12 – OpenVAS URL</p>
			<p>But wait—some<a id="_idIndexMarker1357"/> browsers may flag this page as dangerous, as seen in the next screenshot. However, you can dismiss the warning and continue to OpenVAS:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_13.13_B16290.jpg" alt="Figure 13.13 – Generic warning when opening OpenVAS in the browser&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 13.13 – Generic warning when opening OpenVAS in the browser</p>
			<p>Congratulations!! Now, you should be able to see the OpenVAS login page, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_13.14_B16290.jpg" alt="Figure 13.14 – OpenVAS login page&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 13.14 – OpenVAS login page</p>
			<p>Now, you can<a id="_idIndexMarker1358"/> use the username <code>admin</code> and the password we just copied before to log in to OpenVAS.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-305"><a id="_idTextAnchor319"/>Updating your feeds</h2>
			<p>OpenVAS<a id="_idIndexMarker1359"/> uses several feeds as inputs to check for vulnerabilities, so it is super important to keep them up to date.</p>
			<p>To see the version, you can go to <strong class="bold">Administration</strong> | <strong class="bold">Feed Status</strong>, as highlighted in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_13.15_B16290.jpg" alt="Figure 13.15 – OpenVAS Feed Status page&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 13.15 – OpenVAS Feed Status page</p>
			<p>In case you <a id="_idIndexMarker1360"/>need to update the feeds, use the commands shown next. </p>
			<ul>
				<li>To update <strong class="bold">NVT Feed</strong>, run the following command:<pre><strong class="bold">sudo runuser -u _gvm -- greenbone-nvt-sync</strong></pre></li>
				<li>To update <strong class="bold">SCAP Feed</strong>, run the following command:<pre><strong class="bold">sudo runuser -u _gvm -- greenbone-feed-sync --type SCAP</strong></pre></li>
				<li>To update <strong class="bold">CERT Feed</strong>, run the following command:<pre><strong class="bold">sudo runuser -u _gvm -- greenbone-feed-sync --type CERT</strong></pre></li>
				<li>To update <strong class="bold">GVMD DATA Feed</strong>, run the following command:<pre><strong class="bold">sudo runuser -u _gvm -- greenbone-feed-sync --type GVMD_DATA</strong></pre></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Perfect! You now have an instance of OpenVAS fully configured, updated, and ready to execute scans.</p>
			<p>As mentioned before, you can perform scans of a specific <strong class="bold">Internet Protocol</strong> (<strong class="bold">IP</strong>) address or even a group of IPs.</p>
			<p>Now, you are ready to get familiar with this tool and start testing your environment.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-306"><a id="_idTextAnchor320"/>Overview of Nexpose Community</h1>
			<p><strong class="bold">Nexpose</strong> is <a id="_idIndexMarker1361"/>another vulnerability scanner that is very similar to OpenVAS.</p>
			<p>Nexpose<a id="_idIndexMarker1362"/> Community is supported by <strong class="bold">Rapid7</strong> and you can download it here: <a href="https://www.rapid7.com/info/nexpose-community/">https://www.rapid7.com/info/nexpose-community/</a>.</p>
			<p>We have to highlight the fact that the functionality has been limited; however, in case you want the full version, they also offer the full version of Nexpose for a 30-day trial.</p>
			<p>The installation steps are well documented at the following link: <a href="https://docs.rapid7.com/nexpose/download">https://docs.rapid7.com/nexpose/download</a>.</p>
			<p>To run a scan, you just need to follow this simple flow, as highlighted in <em class="italic">Figure 13.16</em>:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong class="bold">INFO &amp; SECURITY</strong>: Here, you just need to add a name and description of the testing.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">ASSETS</strong>: Select the <em class="italic">assets</em> or system to be scanned.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">AUTHENTICATION</strong>: Here, you can add the credentials for authenticated tests.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">TEMPLATES</strong>: Here, you can<a id="_idIndexMarker1363"/> choose the type of scan to be performed—for example, a <strong class="bold">Sarbanes-Oxley</strong> (<strong class="bold">SOX</strong>) scan or PCI DSS.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">ENGINES</strong>: Here, you select the sources from where the system will gather the vulnerabilities.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">SCHEDULE</strong>: This is a very cool option that enables you to schedule future or recurrent tests. </li>
			</ol>
			<p>You can see an overview of this in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_13.16_B16290.jpg" alt="Figure 13.16 – Nexpose Community GUI&#13;&#10;"/>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 13.16 – Nexpose Community GUI</p>
			<p>Additionally, Rapid7 released<a id="_idIndexMarker1364"/> a new offering <a id="_idIndexMarker1365"/>called <strong class="bold">InsightVM</strong> (see <em class="italic">Figure 13.17</em>), advertised as an enhanced<a id="_idIndexMarker1366"/> version of Nexpose and including dashboards, remediation projects, <strong class="bold">continuous monitoring</strong> (<strong class="bold">CM</strong>), and more. </p>
			<p>Here, you can find a detailed comparison between Nexpose and the new <strong class="bold">InsightVM</strong>: <a href="https://www.rapid7.com/products/nexpose/insightvm-comparison/">https://www.rapid7.com/products/nexpose/insightvm-comparison/</a>.</p>
			<p>You can see the default dashboard on InsightVM in the following screenshot:</p>

			<p>There are many <a id="_idIndexMarker1367"/>more vulnerability testing systems, either to run locally from your computer or even cloud-based, that you can execute from any part of the world with a simple click.</p>
			<p>In fact, there<a id="_idIndexMarker1368"/> are <a id="_idIndexMarker1369"/>many<a id="_idIndexMarker1370"/> other<a id="_idIndexMarker1371"/> tools, such as <strong class="bold">legion</strong>, <strong class="bold">nikto</strong>, <strong class="bold">nmap</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Unix-privesc-checker</strong>, that you can also use to find vulnerabilities in your system and, as seen in the following screenshot, all of them are available for free on Kali Linux:</p>

			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 13.18 – Vulnerability analysis tools on Kali Linux</p>
			<p><em class="italic">Which one is better?</em></p>
			<p>That will depend on your company, your budget, and even the regulations that you must be in<a id="_idIndexMarker1372"/> compliance with. But also, it is very important to consider which of all of these tools you feel more comfortable managing and using.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-307"><a id="_idTextAnchor321"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>Vulnerability management is a key area in defensive security; therefore, in this chapter, we focused on the tools used to perform vulnerability assessments.</p>
			<p>Here, you also learned about the types of tools available, plus some strategies that, as a cybersecurity leader, you can use to enhance your vulnerability scanning strategy.</p>
			<p>Additionally, we installed OpenVAS, which is considered by many as the best free vulnerability scanner, which is surely a must-have tool in your cybersecurity arsenal.</p>
