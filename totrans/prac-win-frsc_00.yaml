- en: Regardless of your level of experience in the field of information security
    in general, *Practical Windows Forensics* will fully introduce you to digital
    forensics. It will provide you with the knowledge needed to assemble different
    types of evidence properly, and walk you through the various stages of the analysis
    process.

- en: We start by discussing the principles of the digital forensics process and move
    on to learning about the approaches that are used to conduct analysis. We will
    then study various tools to perform live analysis, and go through different techniques
    to analyze volatile and nonvolatile data. This will be followed by recovering
    data from hard drives and learning how to use multiple tools to perform registry
    and system log analyses.

    aspects of investigations. We will then go on to extract data from a computer's
    memory and investigate network traffic, which is another important checkpoint.
    Lastly, you will learn a few ways in which you can present data, because every
    investigator needs a work station where they can analyze forensic data.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. The Foundations and Principles of Digital
    Forensics"), *The Foundations and Principles of Digital Forensics*, explains the
    importance of the principles of the digital forensics process and the approaches
    that are usually used to conduct an analysis.'

- en: '[Chapter 2](ch02.html "Chapter 2. Incident Response and Live Analysis"), *Incident
    Response and Live Analysis*, discusses the hardware and software that the responder
    should have to perform incident response properly. Incident response is a very
    important process that needs to be conducted carefully to properly collect all
    the available evidence, which will be analyzed in the analysis phase.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 3](ch03.html "Chapter 3. Volatile Data Collection"), *Volatile Data
    Collection*, discusses how to collect the volatile data of the system. Volatile
    data, such as system memory, is very important and can tell what is happening
    in the system in the running time. So, to conduct post mortem analysis on this
    kind of evidence, we need to acquire the evidence first. Also, it changes very
    quickly, and collecting it in the right way is a very important issue.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 4](ch04.html "Chapter 4. Nonvolatile Data Acquisition"), *Nonvolatile
    Data Acquisition*, talks about the acquisition of nonvolatile data, such as the
    hard drive, and how to collect such data forensically in order to not change the
    integrity of this evidence.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 5](ch05.html "Chapter 5. Timeline"), *Timeline,* discusses Timeline,
    which shows all the system and user activities on the system in chronological
    order. It helps building the whole picture of the incident. And we will show you
    how to do it with the plaso framework.'

- en: '[Chapter 6](ch06.html "Chapter 6. Filesystem Analysis and Data Recovery"),
    *Filesytem Analysis and Data Recovery*, gives you a good understanding of the
    most famous file systems. To perfectly understand how the tools work, either for
    analysis or recovery, the reader needs to understand how the files are stored
    in the file system in the partitioned hard drive.'

- en: '[Chapter 7](ch07.html "Chapter 7. Registry Analysis"), *Registry Analysis*,
    discusses the structure of the registry and some tools used to perform analyses.
    When MS Windows operates, almost all actions are mapped in the registry. The registry
    files are considered the Windows database. Registry forensics can help answer
    a lot of issues, from what kind of application has been installed on the system
    to user activities, and many more.'

- en: '[Chapter 8](ch08.html "Chapter 8. Event Log Analysis"), *Event Log Analysis*,
    explains that the MS Windows system has good features out of the box, we just
    need to know how to use them. One of these features is logging. Logging can help
    to figure out what has happened on the system. It logs all the events on the system
    including security events or other events related to the applications within the
    system.'

- en: '[Chapter 9](ch09.html "Chapter 9. Windows Files"), *Windows Files*, tell us
    that MS Windows has a lot of artifacts, which are created in the currently running
    Windows. During analysis, these artifacts can be used to prove or refute hypotheses,
    or in some cases uncover new interesting information with evidential value.'

    and E-mail Investigation*, talks about the Internet, and the World Wide Web of
    course, is the main channel of information that users use to exchange data. Browsers
    are the most common tools that are used to do that. So, the investigation of browsers
    is important when analysts try to investigate user’s activity. There are a lot
    of browsers and we will cover the most popular among them: IE, FF, and Chrome.'

    especially in a corporate environment. This chapter will cover e-mail formats
    and explain how to read e-mails from PFF files for analysis and to trace senders.

    discusses how memory is the working space for the operating system. It the past,
    memory forensics was optional, but now there are a few very powerful tools that
    allow us to extract a lot of evidential information from the memory and take digital
    forensics to a new level.'

- en: '[Chapter 12](ch12.html "Chapter 12. Network Forensics"), *Network Forensics*,
    discusses how network forensics provides another perspective to the incident.
    Network traffic can reveal a lot of information about the behavior of malicious
    activity. Together with other sources of information, networks will speed up the
    investigation process. You will also learn not only about the traditional tools,
    such as Wireshark, but also about the powerful Bro framework.'

- en: Appendix A, *Building a Forensic Analysis Environment*, discusses the creation
    of convenient work environment to conduct the digital forensics analysis in the
    digital forensics lab at an enterprise scale. After the previous chapters we should
    now have realized how important incident response is for digital forensics processes
    and how necessary it is to deal with both of them accurately.

    primary analysis on different types of evidences and we will go through live analysis
    along with the post-mortem analysis.
