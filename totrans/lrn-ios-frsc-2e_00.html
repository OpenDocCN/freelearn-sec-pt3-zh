<html><head></head><body><div class="preface" title="Preface"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="pref07"/>Preface</h1></div></div></div><p>This book is a complete discussion of state-of-the-art technology used in identification, acquisition, and forensic analysis of mobile devices with the iOS operating system, and it has been extended and updated to iOS 8 and 9.
It is a practical guide that will help investigators understand how to manage scenarios efficiently during their daily work on this type of mobile device. The need for a practical guide in this area arises from the growing popularity of iOS devices and the different scenarios that an investigator may face, according to the type of device, the version of the operating system, and the presence or absence of security systems (code lock, backup password, and so on).
The book is divided (conceptually) into four parts. The first part deals with the basic concepts related to methods and guidelines to be followed in the treatment of digital evidence and information specific to an iOS device. The second part covers the basic techniques and tools for acquisition of an iOS device, also through a backup and iCloud. The third part goes deep into the methodology and techniques for analyzing the data. Finally, the fourth part provides an overview of issues related to the analysis of iOS applications and malware.
For those who are new to this field, we recommend a sequential reading of the book, since the arguments are processed in the order of the main phases of a forensic investigation (identification, acquisition, and analysis). For the more experienced readers, and for those who routinely deal with this type of device, the book can be considered as a useful tool to evaluate different techniques, depending on the type of case that you have to handle.</p><div class="section" title="What this book covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="pf07lvl1sec1"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p><a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Digital and Mobile Forensics">Chapter 1</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Digital and Mobile Forensics</em></span>, is an introduction to the most important concepts and definitions in the field of digital and mobile forensics, and the life cycle of digital evidence, which includes identification, acquisition, analysis, and reporting.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Introduction to iOS Devices">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Introduction to iOS Devices</em></span>, contains useful information and references that will help you learn how to identify the various types of device (such as iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch) with respect to their model and iOS version. It also contains basic information about the filesystem used on a specific kind of device.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. Evidence Acquisition from iDevices">Chapter 3</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Evidence Acquisition from iDevices</em></span>, explains how to acquire data from iOS devices with respect to their model and iOS version, which was introduced in the previous chapter. Physical, logical, and advanced logical acquisitions are discussed, along with the most useful techniques on how to crack or bypass the passcode set by the user. This chapter presents examples of acquisitions realized with various tools, with latest techniques for iOS 8 and iOS 9.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Evidence Acquisition and Analysis from iTunes Backup">Chapter 4</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Evidence Acquisition and Analysis from iTunes Backup</em></span>, gives an overview of how to deal with the analysis of an iTunes backup taken from a PC or a Mac, focusing on how to read its content and how to try to attack a protected password set by the user. This chapter also explains how to recover passwords stored in the device when the backup is not protected by a password of its own or when the analyst is able to crack it.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. Evidence Acquisition and Analysis from iCloud">Chapter 5</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Evidence Acquisition and Analysis from iCloud</em></span>, deals with the case in which the owner is using iCloud to store the device's backup. You will learn how to recover the credentials or the authorization token used to retrieve the information stored in Apple servers.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Analyzing iOS Devices">Chapter 6</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Analyzing iOS Devices</em></span>, provides a complete set of information regarding how to analyze data stored in the acquired device. Both preinstalled (such as address book, call history, SMS, MMS, and Safari) and third-party applications (such as chat, social network, and cloud storage) are explained, with particular attention to the core artifacts and how to search and recover them.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. Applications and Malware Analysis">Chapter 7</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Applications and Malware Analysis</em></span>, is an introduction to the core concepts and tools used to perform an application assessment from a security point of view.

<div class="section" title="What you need for this book"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="pf07lvl1sec2"/>What you need for this book</h1></div></div></div><p>This book is designed to allow you to use different operating platforms (Windows, Mac, and Linux) through freeware, open source software, and commercial software. Many of the examples shown can be replicated using either the software tested by the authors or equivalent solutions that have been mentioned in <a class="link" href="apb.html" title="Appendix B. Tools for iOS Forensics">Appendix B</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Tools for iOS Forensics</em></span>. Some specific cases require the use of commercial platforms, and among those, we preferred the platforms that we use in our daily work as forensic analysts (such as Cellebrite UFED, Oxygen Forensics, Elcomsoft iOS Forensic Toolkit, and Elcomsoft Phone Breaker). In any case, we were inspired by the principles of ease of use, completeness of information extracted, and the correctness of the presentation of the results by the software. This book is not meant to be a form of advertisement for the aforementioned software in any way, and we encourage you to repeat the tests that are carried out on one operating platform even on other platforms and software applications.</p></div>
<div class="section" title="Who this book is for"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="pf07lvl1sec3"/>Who this book is for</h1></div></div></div><p>This book is intended mainly for a technical audience, and more specifically for forensic analysts (or digital investigators) who need to acquire and analyze information from mobile devices running iOS. This book is also useful for computer security experts and penetration testers because it addresses some issues that must be definitely taken into consideration before the deployment of this type of mobile devices in business environments or situations where data security is a necessary condition.
Finally, this book can be also of interest for developers of mobile applications, and they can learn what data is stored in these devices where the application is used. Thus, they will be able to improve security.</p></div>
