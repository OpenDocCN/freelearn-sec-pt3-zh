                    <h1 class="header-title">Mobile security</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Mobile security is a cybersecurity field that deals with the protection of portable computing devices from threats and vulnerabilities. In this section, we will discover what mobile computing devices are normally more exposed to.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Loss or theft</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Devices such as phones and laptops can be easily lost or stolen in public places, cabs, and offices, among other places. From a cybersecurity perspective, what is more worrying is the amount of sensitive data that can be recovered from the lost or stolen devices. Users tend to keep lots of personal information in mobile devices. Passwords, bank information, social security numbers, and even confidential information belonging to corporations can be stolen from these devices. Alongside these, mobile devices are normally logged in to several email accounts, social media accounts, and sensitive systems. When the device is accessed by unauthorized people, sensitive data could be stolen and the logged-in accounts could be used for theft, extortion, or social engineering.</p>
<p>Below are some recent newspaper articles which highlights the dangers of losing your mobile phone. And based on Kensington the average cost of a loss or theft of a mobile device can be exceeding US $49.000</p>
<p>Tips you should apply before you lose your mobile device:</p>
<ul>
<li>Turn on remote tracking:
<ul>
<li><strong>In iOS:</strong> Find my iPhone</li>
<li><strong>In Android</strong>: Find My Device</li>
<li><strong>For Windows</strong>: Sign in to <a href="http://account.microsoft.com/devices">http://account.microsoft.com/devices</a> with your Microsoft account, and follow the steps in Lost My Device to register your laptop</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Software-related security issues</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Most smartphone operating systems use a permission-based system to allow apps to do certain functions or access certain data from the phone. However, this is not a guarantee that the apps will not request too many privileges. The approval part still lies with the user, but not all users are tech-savvy enough to know when apps are requesting unnecessary permissions. According to Appthority Inc., many free apps have ties with advertising networks. Therefore, the apps are used to collect data such as contacts, browser records, and location, which is then shared with the advertisers.</p>
<p>By using the Appthority Platformâ„¢, the security team at Appthority analyzed the top 50 free apps from Apple's App Store and Google Play Store for risky app behavior. The findings are recorded in the <em>App Reputation Report</em>. You can read the <em>App Reputation Report</em> at <a href="https://www.appthority.com/company/press/press-releases/appthority-reveals-security-risks-of-free-mobile-apps/">https://www.appthority.com/company/press/press-releases/appthority-reveals-security-risks-of-free-mobile-apps/</a>.<a href="https://www.appthority.com/company/press/press-releases/appthority-reveals-security-risks-of-free-mobile-apps/"/></p>
<p>Malware attacks are also increasingly becoming a mobile security concern. There has been a rise in the number of threats that can be used against phones across several operating systems. This is a big threat, since many users do not install antivirus systems on their phones.</p>
<p>The number of threats and vulnerabilities keeps rising, and this has opened up a career for mobile security professionals. Individuals and corporations that want to have all-around security want professionals that can protect their mobile devices so that they cannot be easily compromised when on the go. Also, there is an increasing demand for smartphone forensic experts that can track back a mobile security attack to find its root cause and mitigation. Therefore, studying mobile security technologies and mobile forensic technologies could open up a long-term career in cybersecurity.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Advanced data security</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Data has become a prime target in cyber attacks, and, consequently, individuals and corporations are opting to spend more resources to secure their confidential data. There have been many reports of data breaches where user data is stolen by hackers, trade secrets are stolen by competitors, enemy states steal each other's military records, and prototypes for sensitive products are continually stolen.</p>
<p>The threat landscape surrounding data is continually changing. To prevent attacks and comply with all data security regulations, organizations are going to be looking for experts to offer advanced data security. This will prevent data breaches, ensure that sensitive data is not accessed by unauthorized people, and prevent an event that will lead to non-compliance with data regulations. A cybersecurity career in advanced data security is, therefore, a guarantee of never-ending career opportunities in the future. As an expert in this field, you will mainly be in charge of installing data security products, configuring existing security software in the most secure way, and drafting security policies to ensure data protection in organizations.</p>
<p>There are several e-Learning websites that offer training courses on data security. One of them is Udemy, which offers introductory courses to data security and then allows a learner to specialize with one of many advanced data security courses. The introductory course lays a good foundation from which you can advance to specific aspects of data security. Some of the advancement options in data security are cloud data security and encryption. Taking these courses allows you to build a career in the general data security field or in specific niches, such as data stored in the cloud.</p>
<p>Please Google <kbd>advanced data security</kbd> and read the recommendations from Microsoft, IBM, and Oracle to learn more what those tech giants offer in terms of advanced data security.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Cloud security</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The cloud technology has come with benefits that are valuable to many organizations. Today, organizations do not need to own computing resources to deploy software and systems. The cost benefits that have been realized from cloud computing have seen quite a number of organizations adopting it. However, there have been several fears about the technology that have possibly held back organizations from fully adopting it. Organizations are not quite ready to trust third-party cloud vendors with sensitive data. The organizations that have put out their data on the cloud want to ensure that it is safe and cannot be accessed by unauthorized parties, and this includes the cloud platform vendors.</p>
<p>Many of the organizations that have adopted, or are contemplating adopting, the cloud technology undoubtedly need a cybersecurity expert to guide them. As a cloud security expert, you will have the skills to ensure that data and systems are secure on the cloud platform. You will ensure that apps running from the cloud cannot be manipulated by third parties. You will also ensure that the data stored on the cloud is secure and cannot be accessed by unauthorized parties. You will ensure that authentication and authorization to databases and systems are strict, so that stolen credentials cannot be used to access it. Lastly, you will have to devise ways to prevent the cloud platform owner or vendor from accessing data on the cloud. Since many organizations will eventually adopt cloud technologies, job opportunities in this field will gradually increase.</p>
<p>The learning options in cloud security are many, as most e-Learning academies offer the course. Some of the trusted platforms that you can learn about this include Coursera and edX. edX in particular offers cloud security as a micro masters program and delves deeply into the cloud, its associated security challenges, and how they can be mitigated. At the end of the course, a student is able to handle virtually all security challenges affecting the cloud.</p>
<p>We will discuss more about this in <a href="6db093ec-4c27-4f86-8025-b6a5df56780a.xhtml">Chapter 9</a>, <em>Knowledge Check and Certifications</em>.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Modern day regulations</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Tough regulations have already been put in place to punish companies that fail to safeguard user data. The most recent regulation touching on this was the <strong>General Data Protection Regulation</strong> (<strong>GDPR</strong>), which is quite demanding for organizations that want to be fully compliant with its requirements. The consequence of non-compliance with GDPR is that organizations found culpable will be heavily fined. GDPR is just one of the many regulations in cyberspace that have been designed to protect privacy and ensure security. There are many other regulations that apply to different jurisdictions. In the US, there is the <strong>HIPAA Act</strong>, the <strong>Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act</strong>, and the <strong>Federal Information Security Act</strong>, which regulate the collection, use, and protection of data in healthcare, financial, and federal agencies. There are more laws that are coming up in countries such as the US, with more bills still in the queue to become future laws.</p>
<p>The regulatory space can, therefore, drastically change in months. Organizations do not always have the resources to stay abreast with the regulatory changes. The problem with data is that it can move across several regions and be subject to different regulations. For instance, while the GDPR only affects the data belonging to EU citizens, organizations world over have to comply with it, since they cannot foretell when they will interact with data from EU citizens. Many data regulations have to be followed, regardless of the geographical region they are passed in.</p>
<p>It would take a lot of resources for organizations to research all of the regulations that they are supposed to follow, and this is why they mostly outsource this function. You can create a career out of being a consultant for data regulations. You have to be conversant with all applicable data regulations to a company and help the company in complying with the regulations. You have to keep updated with all the changes in these regulations and advise organizations accordingly when changes are made. The cyberspace is soon going to face major challenges for regulatory compliance. It is estimated that there is an average of 200 regulatory changes globally. While many of these do not currently affect the cybersecurity industry, soon they will. It is, therefore, best to start learning to become a regulatory compliance consultant for organizations today.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Incidence response and forensics</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Statistics released each year from credible sources show a startling fact that cybersecurity incidences are going up at a fast rate. In July 2018, Positive Technologies released a report showing that cyber attacks had increased by 32% in 2018's first quarter compared to the previous year's statistics. Malware attacks alone had increased by 75% since 2017 and had been targeted at individuals, government agencies, and businesses.</p>
<p>You can read more about this at <a href="https://www.ptsecurity.com/ww-en/about/news/293941/">https://www.ptsecurity.com/ww-en/about/news/293941/</a>.</p>
<p>What is common in many cybersecurity incidences is that the targets try to respond to minimize the impacts and then do thorough investigations to find out the cause of the incident. However, there are not many professionals skilled enough to do this. With the frequency of attacks only going up, organizations are finding the need to hire competent personnel that can respond to and mitigate cybersecurity incidences as they happen. Individuals and organizations that have already fallen victim to cyber attacks will be looking for professionals that can trace back the attack in order to prevent future similar attacks.</p>
<p>The problem is that the cybersecurity industry is playing catch-up with cybercriminals, since today's attackers are increasingly becoming sophisticated. Organizations are finding hope in skilled incidence response personnel that have the capabilities to stop attacks as they happen, or drastically reduce the impact. If you train to be an incident response expert, you will hardly be free given the trend that's been observed in the cybersecurity industry. Coupled with this, digital forensics is also now coming into play.</p>
<p>Some organizations that lost money to attackers have been able to track and find part of it due to digital forensics. For instance, Ubiquiti Networks lost $44 million to attackers, and, due to efforts from digital forensic experts, $8 million was recovered shortly afterwards. Therefore, you will also find demand in the digital forensics job market. Incidence response and digital forensics go hand-in-hand and it is best that you learn the two together. If you pursue these two, you will first learn about the techniques used to respond to cybersecurity incidences at different stages. You will also learn about the tools and techniques used in digital forensic investigations. Once equipped with these skills, you will be ready for a promising career in the cybersecurity industry.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Enterprise security at scale</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Security has become a broad and challenging issue for enterprises. It is wide-scoped and includes ensuring the security of systems and networks, understanding the motive of attackers, understanding different types of attacks, understanding the users and targets, and also planning on how to respond to attacks. The scope keeps getting wider as organizations adopt new technologies, deploy new systems, or get new personnel. Internal staff working in IT departments are not always able to comb through the wide scope and ensure that the organization is safe. This is why there has been an increase in the demand for enterprise security specialists.</p>
<p>To venture into this career, you need to have vast experience in IT. This is because clients will expect you to be knowledgeable in all of the seven domains of an IT infrastructure. You will also need to have up-to-date information on the most prevalent cyber attacks and how they can be prevented or mitigated. You might also need some soft skills, as you will be expected to train users on security threats and how they can reduce their exposure or act during an attack.</p>
<p>There are several courses for this career being offered by reputable institutions. Microsoft has 39 courses on enterprise security, which touch upon the whole scope of today's IT infrastructure. One of these is the <strong>Microsoft Professional Program for Cybersecurity</strong>, which is fully inclusive of all that you need to know to be an enterprise security specialist for organizations that use Microsoft operating systems. Taking such courses is an investment, since job opportunities are already there and others will continually present themselves. Besides this, there is less competition in this line of work, as it requires a specialist that has undergone long-term training and is conversant with all the enterprise security needs.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Penetration testing</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Most organizations are opting to have white hats search for vulnerabilities in different systems, networks, and even users to identify the weak points that can be used to attack. Penetration testing entails the legal attempts to hack an organization with the purpose of finding all possible avenues that can be exploited by real hackers during attacks. Learning to be a penetration tester takes you through the same concepts of hacking that black hats use. Black hats only use these hacking skills for their own malicious purposes, while white hats use the hacking skills they have to help organizations protect themselves. In a penetration testing course, the tools and techniques that are used during real attacks are the ones that get taught. This ensures that white hats are at par with black hats as far as skills and techniques are concerned.</p>
<p>Leading universities and online learning academies have warmed up to the idea of teaching this course. A comprehensive outline of what the course covers can be obtained from SANS, and it outlines the following:</p>
<p>The initial training introduces a learner to cybersecurity and ethical hacking in general. The learner then progresses and learns the categories of learning tools, techniques, and exploits that are used during hacks. The real ethical hacking then begins where learners are taught about web-based systems penetration testing using tools and techniques that hackers rely on to compromise such systems. From web-apps, learners are taught about network penetration where different tools that can compromise networks and devices connected to the networks are taught. At this point, the learner is able to scout for networks, steal network passwords, observe the traffic flowing in a network, and target devices connected to the network.</p>
<p>The stage of penetration testing involves learning social engineering techniques that can be used to hack the users. Users are often referred to as the weakest links in the cybersecurity chain because they can be easily manipulated. White hats are taught the techniques and tools that they can use to dig up background information about a user, target them with a social engineering attack, and take advantage of the user when he or she has fallen prey to the attack. Commonly, social engineering allows hackers to steal login credentials to highly secure systems, or directly steal data and funds by ordering the users to make unauthorized transactions. Lastly, the penetration testing course trains students on how to steal data from mobile devices. It might seem as though the course might lead to more malicious hackers, but, in the real sense, it produces white hats that protect organizations from black hats. Penetration testing courses are also neatly structured so that they promote ethical values in the IT world.</p>
<p>Learning penetration testing thrusts you into a lucrative career of being a vulnerability assessment consultant or a penetration tester. As the number of malicious actors continues to rise, organizations are going to be in demand of experts that can find vulnerabilities in their systems before the hackers can. Statistics show that organizations are continually increasing their IT spending on cybersecurity, and hiring a pen tester is one of the best investments that they can make. Therefore, it is worthwhile to learn penetration testing as it can guarantee a stable and well-paying career in the cybersecurity industry.</p>

However, most of these institutions only focus on teaching developers how to actualize functionalities in application systems. Very few developers join the market with the aspect of security in development. As the IT environment is continually becoming less secure and more unpredictable, a new approach is required when developing apps and systems.</p>
<p>DevSecOps is a premise that states that anyone involved in software development is responsible for bringing together development and security. Initially, security used to be an after-thought. The development team would build the software first and then integrate security into it.</p>
<p>DevSecOps discourages this, and instead enforces a new development approach where security is tightly coupled with all other software development phases. Security is thus embedded in all development processes rather than coming in as an addition at the end of a development project.</p>
<p>DevSecOps ensures that the responsibility of security is equally shared in a software development project and that security is continually integrated from start to end. With the integrated approach, security is not built around the perimeter of systemsâ€”it is built within every part of the system. This makes it hard for malicious persons to compromise the system. During software development, developers have security in mind and they continually share their insights on security threats and how they can make their software resistant to the threats. For instance, if the known threat takes advantage of a one-time authentication procedure, the developers can implement authentication at every module of a software so that an unauthorized person is not able to carry out any significant transactions in a system, even after bypassing the initial authentication process.</p>
<p>When learning DevSecOps, you will develop a new perspective on development. It will not just be about functionalities, but the security of the software as well. You will learn how to determine the risk tolerance of a software and how to improve it. You will also learn how to do a risk/benefit analysis. At times, too much security might hinder some essential services or make the software needlessly slow. Therefore, DevSecOps ensures that security is not at either extreme so that it makes a software unusable due to the inclusion of too many security controls, or insecure to use due to few security controls. DevSecOps is fast gaining popularity in the market and organizations are looking for system developers that use this approach of building software. The benefits of DevSecOps are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Speed and agility</strong>: Software development is done in small iterations in which security is continually added. Also, security teams do not have to wait until a piece of software is completed to integrate security controls.</li>
<li><strong>Response to changes</strong>: There are many changes that occur in the IT environment and they may, at times, affect the way security is integrated into software. For instance, new threats may emerge during software development and the developers have to respond by making their system resistant to the threat. For instance, older systems were built to check where login credentials matched those in a database. However, when hackers began using password dictionaries, software developers responded by including a counter to prevent a certain number of login trials from being exceeded. DevSecOps prepares developers to react in such ways.</li>
<li><strong>Quality assurance testing</strong>: Systems built with the DevSecOps approach are easier to test, since all components are tightly coupled. Security is not a module; rather, it is built into the software and can be thoroughly tested when other functionalities of the software are being tested.</li>
<li><strong>Early identification of vulnerabilities</strong>: With DevSecOps, software does not have to get to bug testers for vulnerabilities to be identified. All developers have the mindset of ensuring the security of a system, so they are always on the lookout for vulnerabilities that can be exploited. With many eyes sweeping through the code just to find out vulnerabilities, nearly all possible vulnerabilities are identified and resolved during development.</li>
</ul>
<p>DevSecOps training is focused on a technical shift where you learn how to prioritize security during development. You also learn how to collaborate with other developers or security teams to ensure that the end deliverable is highly secure. DevSecOps is also focused on agility and fast responses to change. When taking the training, you will mostly learn code analysis, change management, compliance monitoring, threat investigation, and vulnerability assessment. In the future, other software development approaches will slowly be abandoned and companies will be looking for developers who are well-versed in DevSecOps. Therefore, take the course today and reserve yourself a guaranteed space in software development in tomorrow's job market.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">IoT security</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>In the first two quarters of 2018, IoT devices grew at an unprecedented rate to hit a total of 7 billion devices. It has been projected that there may be 20.8 billion IoT devices in active use by 2020.</p>
<p>You can find more about this at <a href="https://iot-analytics.com/state-of-the-iot-update-q1-q2-2018-number-of-iot-devices-now-7b/">https://iot-analytics.com/state-of-the-iot-update-q1-q2-2018-number-of-iot-devices-now-7b/</a>.</p>
<p>Going by the numbers from the first two quarters of 2018, the numbers are going to grow quickly. However, there has been a major challenge with IoT devices regarding their security. These devices have been flooded into the market by different manufacturers while lacking the bare minimum security requirements. As a result, many botnets are being formed using these devices.</p>
<p>Botnets are malicious networks of internet-connected devices that are used for performing denial-of-service attacks, or spamming. One of the most powerful botnets today is called Mirai, which is purely made up of IoT devices. These are the repercussions of having so many insecure devices in use.</p>
<p>IoT devices are being targeted by hackers and are being used as points of entry into organizations or homes. Since the devices are normally connected to a network, hackers are breaching the devices and navigating through the network to attack other devices.</p>
<p>For instance, a hacker might breach an IoT device and get into the network to spread malware to all computers sharing the same network with the device. Such attacks have been happening, and there are bound to be more attacks like this in the future.</p>
<p>Since many organizations are prioritizing their security, they will be looking for experts to secure their IoT devices so that they cannot be manipulated by hackers. Apart from organizations, governments that are using IoT devices to implement systems such as smart grids are also going to be looking for experts to secure such systems from attacks. This, therefore, opens the opportunities for an IoT security expert.</p>
<p>IoT security is a fast growing area that is seeking to add a layer of reliable security to the IoT technology. It aims at eradicating the currently existing security flaws in the IoT technology so that they can be more resistant to cyber attacks. IoT security is performed in four steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Understanding the IoT process</strong>: IoT devices play different roles, such as collecting data or actualizing some functionalities in a system. You need to learn how to identify the process that needs to be protected. Some processes are more sensitive than others, and a good example is an IoT that controls a life-critical system.</li>
<li><strong>Understanding the engineering of the product</strong>: There are many IoT device manufacturers and they have engineered their devices in different ways due to the absence of industry-wide standards. Of importance from a security point of view is understanding how some access controls such as login have been implemented. It is also important to identify the backdoors and other poor security practices that may lead the device to being compromised.</li>
<li><strong>Securing the device</strong>: With a good understanding of the engineering of an IoT device, you can make the appropriate changes to secure it. These changes involve the implementation of security best practices to ensure that the device is secured. Default passwords can be changed, backdoors could be removed, cryptography could be enabled, the device could be reset to free it from any botnet, and all IoT devices could be connected to an isolated and highly secured network. The changes made need to be well-thought out to prevent potential damage or disruption of service to the IoT device itself.</li>
<li><strong>Implementation of security policies</strong>: To ensure standardized security for all IoT devices, it is important to set up security policies to be followed wherever IoT devices are concerned. Due to the interconnected nature of these devices, it only takes one insecure IoT device to compromise the whole organization. Therefore, there should be strict compliance with security policies.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is already expected that there will be more IoT devices in the market, so it is not a question of whether or not there will be IoT security jobs. With the trend of quick adoption of IoT devices and increased cyber attacks, many organizations will seek IoT security services. Therefore, this could be a secure career path to start today.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">User behavior analytics (UBA)</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Users have contributed to some of the worst cyber attacks that have happened in the world. For instance, the worst attack on Yahoo, an email service provider, was caused by just one click from a user. The FBI investigated the cause of the breach that led to the compromise of millions of user accounts and discovered that there were spear-phishing emails that were targeted at specific Yahoo employees. It is said that one of those targeted clicked on a malicious link that led to hackers compromising the employee's computer and using it to gain access to the network.</p>
<p>Once in the network, the hackers installed a backdoor that allowed them to connect to and steal Yahoo's user database. Investigations revealed that the hacker responsible for these operations handed over the stolen database to other commercial hackers. Soon, the hackers started breaching individual accounts to a point where Yahoo came open with news about the hack.</p>
<p>The hack can, therefore, be traced back to a single user that did not follow security policies and clicked on a malicious link. There might have been impenetrable defenses in the network, but once a logged in user was compromised, it was easy for the hackers to complete their mission. This type of scenario can happen to any organization. Users are known to be careless and their mistakes can lead to devastating cyber attacks.</p>
<p>Cybercriminals will take advantage of a compromised computer to achieve certain functionalities. For instance, they could use a compromised computer of a finance department employee to initiate financial transactions.</p>
<p>UBA is a new technology aimed at averting disasters when users are compromised. With UBA, big data analytics is used to map the normal user behaviors. For instance, finance department employees could be recorded to transact certain amounts of money to specific accounts and at certain dates. When an anomalous behavior is recorded from a certain user, a red flag is triggered by the system. For instance, if the account of a finance department employee makes abnormally large transactions or transacts at abnormal times, the UBA will send an alert and prevent the transaction from going through. This, therefore, stops an attack from being actualized.</p>
<p>UBA has already been adopted by big organizations that cannot tolerate huge losses. For instance, the SWIFT global payment network, which is used globally by banks to send huge amounts of money, uses such a system. In 2016, there was a hack of the Bangladeshi central bank and hackers initiated huge transactions, some of which SWIFT declined.</p>
<p>The hackers stole $81 million via sending fraudulent messages, and malware which allowed them to hack in to the bank's <strong>SWIFT</strong> (<strong>Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication</strong>), ostensibly from the central bank in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Despite blocking most of the transfer, about $81 million was sent to a Fillipino bank. Following this, the money was further moved to casinos and casino agents and much of it is still missing.</p>
<p>According to SWIFT, hackers obtained valid credentials of the banks employees and then used those credentials to initiate money transactions as if they were legitimate bank employees.</p>
<p>UBA is only getting better with the advancements in artificial intelligence and big data analytics. In the future, many organizations will be adopting such UBA systems. Therefore, there is huge potential in consultancy services for this technology. There are online learning academies that are offering training in several UBA programs that can be used to fight cyber attacks. Such courses teach you how to install and configure the UBA system in organizations, collect normal user data, and define the actions to be taken when a threat is detected. Since most of the actions are taken by the UBA system, most of the hard work will be during installation, configuration, and learning processes. With this information, you could be an established consultant for the installation of UBA systems, user training, and troubleshooting. Since many organizations are going to implement these systems to help them deal with hacking attempts, spam, the spread of malware, and leaks from employees, any trained professional in UBA will find lots of work opportunities in the future.</p>
<p>Learn how credentials work, what <strong>Pass the Hash</strong> (<strong>PtH</strong>) is as of April 2019, those kind attacks are still very active and effective.</p>
<p class="NormalPACKT">PtH is an attack technique where an attacker captures a password or hash and then simply uses the passwords or hash for authentication.</p>
<p>April 2019, Microsoft has confirmed that their free email service (Outlook/Hotmail /MSN) has been compromised. A support agents credential was stolen, which gave hackers unauthorized access to some accounts where they could view account email address, folder names, and some emails.</p>
<p>You can learn how to mitigate PtH attacks and other credential theft attacks via a white paper which Microsoft has published. You can download and read the white paper from this URL: <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=36036">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=36036</a></p>
<p>Also having <strong>Privileged Access Workstations</strong> (<strong>PAWs</strong>) can help you to minimize the potential internet attacks and threat vectors. You can learn more about PAW here: <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/securing-privileged-access/privileged-access-workstations">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/securing-privileged-access/privileged-access-workstations</a></p>
<p>To learn more about cybersecurity attack and defense strategies, you can read a book which is published by Packt and authored by Yuri Diogenes and myself:</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Endpoint detection and response (EDR)</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>EDR has been predicted to be the future of incidence response. Normal incidence response teams are not always well-informed about an attack to be able to quickly identify the cause, mitigate it to prevent adverse impacts, and to remediate the situation. Even after an attack has ended, the normal incidence response personnel cannot assure that they can prevent a future similar attack from happening. EDR is a term that's used to refer to the combination of tools that are used to detect and investigate incidences on endpoints.</p>
<p>This emerging technology is redefining what incidence response is by providing more reliable and timely incidence responses during attacks. EDR is not just one toolâ€”it is composed of different tools that continually monitor endpoints, networks, and users regarding where they centrally store all important information.</p>
<p>EDR is powered by powerful analytics systems that run from a central point to identify any peculiar data recorded by the monitoring agents running in different systems. When a security incident is about to happen, the EDR will give an early warning to system and network admins about a potential attack. For instance, the EDR could detect that a server's internal firewall has continually blocked suspicious traffic streaming from a certain source. The EDR will warn of an imminent attack on the specific server so that preventative measures can be taken. Some EDRs can integrate with other security software, such as antivirus programs that can be used to intervene in cases where malware is detected to have been passed to an endpoint.</p>
<p>EDR is going to receive adoption in the near future by organizations that want continuous monitoring to deter attacks and assist with incidence response. The technology has been marked as an essential component of today's cybersecurity infrastructure. Since attacks are going to keep increasing, organizations will want to have a tool that can help incidence response teams during attacks to quickly identify the cause and mitigate it. They will, therefore, be looking for professionals that can deploy EDR to their IT infrastructure. Also, knowledge of the EDR technology will give you an advantage in IT jobs. It is, therefore, worthwhile to learn about the technology.</p>
