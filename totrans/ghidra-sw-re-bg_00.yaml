- en: This book is a practical guide to the Ghidra reverse engineering tool. Throughout
    it, you will learn, from zero, how to use Ghidra for different purposes, such
    as malware analysis and binary auditing. As you progress through the initial chapters,
    you will also learn how to automate time-consuming reverse engineering tasks using
    Ghidra scripting and how to check the documentation to solve doubts and expand
    your knowledge on your own.

- en: After reading the initial chapters, once you become an advanced Ghidra user,
    you will learn how to extend the capabilities of this reverse engineering tool
    to support new GUI plugins, binary formats, processor modules, and so on. After
    that part of the book, you will acquire Ghidra development skills, being able
    to debug Ghidra and develop your own features extending Ghidra at your pleasure.

    to the Ghidra community where you will learn how to offer your own code, feedback,
    found bugs, and so on to the **National Security Agency** (**NSA**) project, apart
    from interacting with other community members.

- en: In the last chapter of the book, advanced reverse engineering topics will be
    introduced to open your mind to an extremely interesting world, being able to
    wonder about new useful Ghidra features you can develop to improve the Ghidra
    reverse engineering tool.
