      SVMs
     
    </strong>
    
     ), and NNs classify files by analyzing their behavior, metadata, and network activity.
    
    
     For instance, an NN trained on behavior-based features can spot sophisticated malware variants before they’re widely recognized.
    
    
     By continuously learning from new data, these models enhance detection accuracy and reduce dependency on
    
    
     
      signature updates.
     
    
   </p>
   <h3>
    
     Phishing detection with NLP
    
   </h3>
   <p>
    
     AI-powered phishing detection applies NLP to analyze email content, structure, and metadata.
    
    
     By examining factors such as sender authenticity, URL patterns, and textual clues, NLP
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker845">
    </a>
    
     models can accurately identify phishing attempts.
    
    
     For example, an NLP-based classifier trained on common phishing markers can parse subtle indicators in real time, such as domain mismatches or irregular language.
    
    
     This real-time analysis significantly reduces the chances of phishing links reaching
    
    
     
      end users.

     When
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker846">
    </a>
    
     unusual activity deviates from these baselines—such as high data transfers or unfamiliar IP access—the system generates alerts and can take automated action, such as blocking traffic or isolating compromised endpoints.
    
    
     This approach enables adaptive security that evolves with changing network conditions, enhancing response readiness against
    
    
     
      novel threats.

     AI for threat detection
    
   </h2>
   <p>
    
     One of

    </a>
    
     the most effective applications
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker897">
    </a>
    
     of AI in security is threat detection.
    
    
     AI models can analyze network traffic, user behavior, and system logs to identify abnormal patterns that may indicate a security breach.
    
    
     In this section, we will develop a simple anomaly detection system
    
    
     
      using ML.
     
    
   </p>
   <h3>
    
     Data collection and preprocessing
    
   </h3>
   <p>
    
     The first
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker898">
    </a>
    
     step in building a threat detection model is to collect relevant data.
    
    
     Security logs, network traffic data, and system events are typical sources of information.
    
    
     Preprocessing involves cleaning, normalizing, and structuring the data
    
    
     
      for analysis.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     For this example, let’s assume we have network traffic data in a CSV file.
    
    
     We’ll load and preprocess
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker899">
    </a>
    
     the data
    
    
     
      using pandas:
     
    
   </p>
   <pre class="source-code">
<strong class="bold">python</strong>
import pandas as pd
# Load network traffic data
data = pd.read_csv('network_traffic.csv')
# Normalize data (scaling features between 0 and 1)
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler
scaler = MinMaxScaler()
scaled_data = scaler.fit_transform(data)</pre>
   <h3>
    
     Building an anomaly detection model
    
   </h3>
   <p>
    
     Anomaly detection can be achieved using UL techniques.
    
    
     One popular algorithm is the Isolation
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker900">
    </a>
    
     Forest algorithm, which isolates anomalies by creating partitions in the data.
    
    
     We can implement it
    
    
     
      using scikit-learn:
     
    
   </p>
   <pre class="source-code">
from sklearn.ensemble import IsolationForest
# Train the Isolation Forest model
model = IsolationForest(contamination=0.05)  # Assume 5% of the data are anomalies
model.fit(scaled_data)
# Predict anomalies
anomalies = model.predict(scaled_data)
# Identify anomalies (-1 indicates an anomaly)
anomalous_data = data[anomalies == -1]
print(anomalous_data)</pre>
   <p>
    
     In
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker901">
    </a>
    
     this example, the model will detect anomalies in network traffic based on patterns and behavior.
    
    
     Once detected, these anomalies can trigger further investigation or automated
    
    
     
      response mechanisms.

    </a>
    
     antivirus systems rely on signature-based detection, which is ineffective against new or polymorphic malware.
    
    
     AI, however, can detect malware by analyzing the behavior and characteristics
    
    
     
      of files.

   <h3>
    
     Automated incident triage
    
   </h3>
   <p>
    
     AI models can classify incidents based on their severity and type.
    
    
     For instance, a model can analyze
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker910">
    </a>
    
     security logs and categorize
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker911">

   <p>
    
     Here’s a basic example of classifying incidents using an

     After triaging incidents, AI systems can automate responses by integrating with existing security
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker912">
    </a>
    
     tools.
    
    
     For instance, once a high-priority incident is detected, AI can trigger automated actions such as isolating compromised systems, updating firewall rules, or notifying
    
    
     
      security teams.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     Python’s integration with APIs allows for
