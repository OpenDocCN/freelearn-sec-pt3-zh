    are pervasive in the modern world we live in. It’s practically impossible to use
    a web, embedded, or mobile application without interacting with its API. Understanding
    its weaknesses is fundamental for a well-done invasion test. That’s what this
    book is all about.

    to them and their history, going through basic and advanced attacks, exploring
    different code excerpts and techniques, and finishing with security recommendations
    on how to block or avoid such attacks. Hence, this book is divided into the following

    a major social media platform suffered a data breach due to vulnerabilities in
    its API, exposing millions of user records. Similarly, in early 2023, a financial
    services company faced a significant security incident where hackers exploited
    API flaws to siphon off sensitive customer data. These incidents underscore the
    critical need for rigorous API pentesting to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities
    before they can be exploited by malicious actors.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Although pentesting APIs can be useful to junior and novice enthusiasts, it
    will be especially valuable to medium-level to experienced penetration testers,
    since you will preferably have a good foundation on cybersecurity concepts such
    as enumeration, discovery, and pentesting. Some knowledge about higher-level programming
    languages, such as Python and Golang, is also advised.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    owners, developers, pentesters, and all enthusiasts who want to learn a bit more
    about APIs and successful ways of testing their robustness.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 1*](B19657_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor014), *Understanding APIs and their
    Security Landscape*, introduces you to APIs, their components, the role they play
    in contemporary applications, and how users commonly interact with them. Understanding
    the landscape of APIs will enable you to envisage the potential attack vectors.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 2*](B19657_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor028), *Setting Up the Penetration
    Testing Environment*, guides you toward the preparations and setup of the various
    pentest lab components. Some important decisions need to be made, such as the
    selection of tools and frameworks along with the development environment and some
    initial tests. If you are new to the pentesting arena, you will have the chance
    to get to know some relevant terminology and important software.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 3*](B19657_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor042), *API Reconnaissance and Information
    Gathering*, is the first chapter where you will start to play with APIs. Before
    effectively attacking an API endpoint, it is paramount to enumerate and recognize
    what is available. Some penetration tests are completely black boxes, meaning
    you will have absolutely no knowledge about what is running on the API’s side.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 4*](B19657_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor056), *Authentication and Authorization
    Testing*, covers aspects related to **Authentication** (**AuthN**) and **Authorization**
    (**AuthZ**) on applications, focusing on the ways APIs work with this. Then, after
    learning how apps control the access of their users, it is time for you to understand
    how they can be explored and eventually bypassed.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 5*](B19657_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor078), *Injection Attacks and Validation
    Testing*, teaches you how to test APIs against both SQL and NoSQL injections,
    and how such types of attacks could be mostly avoided by correctly validating
    user input.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 6*](B19657_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor102), *Error Handling and Exception
    Testing*, explains that applications do not always run as they were designed by
    their creators. Some unexpected behavior might occur either caused by the users
    themselves or by some internal error. You will learn how bad exception and error
    handling might bring to light valuable information as well as open exploitable
    breaches.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 7*](B19657_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor110), *Denial of Service and* *Rate-Limitin**g
    Testing*, discusses pentesting by **Denial of Service** (**DoS**) and its “distributed”
    variation. These are some of the biggest attacks carried out on the internet.
    You will understand how to test targets with DoS and identify rate-limiting mechanisms,
    as well as how to circumvent them.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 8*](B19657_08.xhtml#_idTextAnchor131), *Data Exposure and Sensitive
    Information Leakage*, introduced you to one of the most dangerous threats to APIs,
    according to OWASP’s Top 10 API. You will learn how to identify data exposure
    and leakage and leverage them to take advantage of their penetration tests against
    APIs.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 9*](B19657_09.xhtml#_idTextAnchor141), *API Abuse and Business Logic
    Testing*, explains that knowing the logic behind API implementations can be quite
    useful for abusing them. You will learn that there are some strategies to leverage
    them for pentesting as well as approaches to avoid falling victim to such threats.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 10*](B19657_10.xhtml#_idTextAnchor153), *Secure Coding Practices
    for APIs*, discusses topics that every software developer, whether or not they
    are creating an API, should be aware of. You will learn about established secure
    coding approaches and standards, as well as some advice on how to avoid many of
    the attacks discussed in the book.'
