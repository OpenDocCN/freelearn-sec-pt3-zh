<p>There are a number of text conventions used throughout this book.</p>
<p><kbd>CodeInText</kbd>: Indicates code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles. Here is an example: "The handle in <kbd>hkResult</kbd> is used by <kbd>RegEnumValueA</kbd> to begin enumerating each registry value under the registry key."</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre> while (true) {<br/>    for (char i = 1; i &lt;= 255; i++) {<br/>      if (GetAsyncKeyState(i) &amp; 1) {<br/>        sprintf_s(lpBuffer, "\\x%02x", i);<br/>        LogFile(lpBuffer, (char*)"log.txt");<br/>      }<br/>    }</pre>
<p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p>
<pre>87 to base-2<br/>87 divided by 2 is 43 remainder <strong>1</strong>.<br/>43 divided by 2 is 21 remainder <strong>1</strong>.<br/>21 divided by 2 is 10 remainder <strong>1</strong>.<br/>10 divided by 2 is 5 remainder <strong>0</strong>.<br/>5 divided by 2 is 2 remainder <strong>1</strong>.</pre>
<p><strong>Bold</strong>: Indicates a new term, an important word, or words that you see onscreen. For example, words in menus or dialog boxes appear in the text like this. Here is an example: "In VirtualBox, click on File|Import Appliance."</p>
<p>Warnings or important notes appear like this.</p>
<p>Tips and tricks appear like this.</p>
