<p>The Windows Registry is one of the richest sources of digital evidence. You can find lots of extremely useful pieces of information during examination of the Registry hives and keys. Computer configurations, recently visited webpages and opened documents, connected USB devices, and many other artifacts can all be acquired through Windows Registry forensic examination.</p>
<p>The Registry has a tree structure. Each tree consists of keys, and each key may have one or more subkeys and values.</p>
<p>As forensic examiners usually deal with drive images, it's very important to know where these registry files are stored. The first six files are located at <span><kbd>C:\Windows\System32\config</kbd>. These files are:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>COMPONENTS</li>
<li>DEFAULT</li>
<li>SAM</li>
<li>SECURITY</li>
<li>SOFTWARE</li>
<li>SYSTEM</li>
</ul>
<p>There are also two files for each user account:</p>
<ul>
<li><kbd>NTUSER.DAT</kbd>, located at <kbd>C:\Users\%Username%\</kbd></li>
<li><kbd>UsrClass.dat</kbd>, located at <kbd><span>C:\Users\%Username%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows</span></kbd></li>
</ul>
<p>In this chapter, we will show you how to examine these files with both commercial and open source forensic tools, and how to recover deleted keys, sub keys, and values.</p>

<p class="mce-root CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">The steps to be followed for Windows Registry analysis using Magnet AXIOM are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Let's create a new case. Once it has been created and all the fields are filled in, go to evidence sources. Click the <span class="packt_screen">Load evidence</span> button, and you will see the <span class="packt_screen">S</span><span class="packt_screen">ELECT AN EVIDENCE SOURCE</span> window, like the one in the following figure:</li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="410" width="662" class="image-border" src="assets/85ea068c-6e6e-4a71-a934-050a871c0c8b.png"/></div>
<div class="packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">Figure 6.1. Magnet AXIOM <span><span>SELECT AN EVIDENCE SOURCE window</span></span></div>
<ol start="2">
<li>This time, let's choose the <span class="packt_screen">COMPUTER IMAGE</span> option. Again, you can use one of the images you acquired in a previous recipe; both RAW and E01 are supported. Looking at the following figure, we can see that our image contains two partitions and an unpartitioned space.</li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="404" width="653" class="image-border" src="assets/1b00e693-3aac-4f7c-94ca-38c78ae8acb4.png"/></div>
<div class="packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">Figure 6.2. Magnet AXIOM ADD FILES AND FOLDERS window</div>
<ol start="3">
<li>You can tick only the main partition (<span class="packt_screen">Partition 2</span>), or choose all available partitions, as we did. Click <span class="packt_screen">NEXT</span> and you will be brought to the <span class="packt_screen">SELECT SEARCH TYPE</span> screen, which you can see in the following figure:</li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="450" width="726" class="image-border" src="assets/21df54f3-538d-49b6-ac2a-834ec830911e.png"/></div>
<div class="packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">Figure 6.3. Magnet AXIOM <span>SELECT SEARCH TYPE window</span></div>
<ol start="4">
<li>There are four search types in the Magnet AXIOM process:
<ul>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Full</span> - used to extract data from all locations, including unallocated space, shadow copies, and so on.</li>
<li><strong><span class="packt_screen">Quick</span></strong> - used to extract data from common areas.</li>
<li><strong><span class="packt_screen">Sector level</span></strong> - this option is very useful for unknown or corrupted file systems, or formatted drives.</li>
<li><strong><span class="packt_screen">Custom</span></strong> - this option enables the examiner to choose locations. For example, if you want AXIOM to carve unallocated space only, you can choose only this location.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px" class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign CDPAlignLeft">For testing purposes, you can choose all locations, but it will take a lot of time to process it. Also, you can start from Quick type to gather low-hanging fruits. If you don't want to make changes to artifact types, you can go straight to the <span class="packt_screen">ANALYZE EVIDENCE</span> section. Click the <span class="packt_screen">ANALYZE EVIDENCE</span> button, and <span class="packt_screen">Magnet AXIOM Examine</span> will show up.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Once data source processing has finished, go to the drop-down menu on the left, like the one you can see in the following figure, and choose the <span class="packt_screen">Registry</span> option:</li>

</ol>
<p>Once you have exported the file, you can parse it with other tools. Of course, Magnet AXIOM is a very powerful forensic tool and it extracts lots of data from registry files, but sometimes it's useful to parse them with some other tools, for example, <strong>RegRipper.</strong> We will show you how to do this in the next recipe.</p>

<p>Magnet AXIOM collects all available registry files so that a digital forensic examiner can analyze them manually, or export them for parsing with other tools. Also, AXIOM extracts a lot of forensic artifacts from these files automatically, so an examiner can analyze the results in the evidence pane of Magnet AXIOM Examine.</p>

<p class="mce-root">RegRipper is an open source Windows forensic tool developed by the famous forensicator Harlan Carvey, the author of the <em>Windows Forensic Analysis</em> series. It's written in Perl, and has a lot of useful plugins available. Also, digital forensic examiners capable of writing in Perl can create their own plugins for their specific needs.</p>

<p>The steps for parsing registry files with RegRipper:</p>
<ol>
<li>You already know how to export registry files from disk images, at least with Magnet AXIOM. So, we are sure you have a file to parse with RegRipper. Start <kbd>rr.exe</kbd>, and you will see a window like the one in the following figure:</li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="265" width="312" class="image-border" src="assets/920bc867-7ee6-4024-9761-6a5e5eacc24b.png"/></div>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter packt_figref CDPAlign">Figure 6.9. RegRipper main window</div>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Here, you have three fields to fill in:</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none">
<ul>
<li>
<p><span class="packt_screen">Hive File</span> - Use the Browse button and choose the hive (registry) file you exported previously. In our case, it's <span class="packt_screen">SYSTEM</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="packt_screen">Report File</span> - Use the Browse button and choose a file to save the output (it's in plain text, so a TXT file will do). In our case, the file is called SYSTEM_output.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="packt_screen">Profile</span> - Choose the right profile for parsing from the drop-down menu. We are using the SYSTEM file as the source, so our profile of choice is 'system'.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li>Once you've chosen your files and the right profile, you can press the <span class="packt_screen">Rip It</span> button. As soon as processing is finished, you are ready to analyze the output:</li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="347" width="626" class="image-border" src="assets/cd23b0ec-e7ce-4b88-bfc9-69399c662af6.png"/></div>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Figure 6.10. RegRipper output</div>
<p>If you scroll down the output file, you will see that there is a lot of important information from a forensic point of view, such as connected USB devices, EventLog configuration, mounted devices, network connections, and so on. The tools work very fast, so this is a good tool set to start with.</p>

<p>If you already have FTK, Registry Viewer will be on your system. If you do not, you can download FTK Imager at AccessData's website - it's free. You will need to fill in some personal information, including your name, company name, position and email address to gain access to the free download. The following figure shows the download page for FTK Imager:</p>

<p>Once Registry Viewer has been installed, navigate to it on your machine and double-click the icon to open the program. Open FTK Imager at the same time.</p>
<ol>
<li>In Imager, go to <span class="packt_screen">File</span> &gt; <span class="packt_screen">Obtain Protected Files</span>.</li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="336" width="641" class="image-border" src="assets/cbc46f6b-b2d1-4bcb-807a-6893e8e5f014.png"/></div>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Figure 6.14. Obtaining protected files</div>
<ol start="2">
<li>In the small box that pops up, choose a destination folder for your files.</li>
</ol>

<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref"><span>Figure 6.15. Choosing a destination folder</span></div>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Note the warning about Imager getting the files from your own system. This is fine in an example like this, or as part of a practice case, but if it shows up when you're trying to find evidence on a forensic image, you know you've chosen the wrong source!</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Make sure you choose <span class="packt_screen">Password recovery and all registry files</span> from below the destination folder bar, otherwise you will only get a stripped-back version of the results. Click <span class="packt_screen">OK</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">It may take a little while to generate, and for the first few seconds it might look like nothing is happening. Remember, patience is a virtue when dealing with technology! You can check whether the process has finished by opening the folder in the file path you specified earlier, which should now be populated as shown in the following screenshot:</p>

<li>Click <span class="packt_screen">File</span> and then <span class="packt_screen">Change folder and Search Options</span>. This will open a dialogue box.

<p style="padding-left: 90px">Click <span class="packt_screen">Apply</span> and then <span class="packt_screen">OK</span>.</p>
<p>Now we can look at the data we have collected from the registry using Registry Viewer.</p>
<ol>
<li>To do that, open Registry Viewer and click <span class="packt_screen">File</span> &gt; <span class="packt_screen">Open</span>, then go to the folder in which you saved the registry files and find the one marked <kbd>NTUSER.DAT</kbd>. Open it.</li>
<li>The <span class="packt_screen">SOFTWARE</span> menu will give you a nice long list of all the pieces of software that have been installed on the machine in question:</li>

<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref"><span>Figure 6.18.</span> <span><span>Software installed on the machine</span></span></div>

<p style="padding-left: 60px">This can be particularly useful if you suspect that a user has been taking anti-forensic measures to try to scupper an investigation.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Under <kbd>NTUSER.DAT\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\InternetExplorer\TypedURLs</kbd>, you can see the addresses of any sites a user visited in Internet Explorer:</li>
