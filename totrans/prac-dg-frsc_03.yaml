    involved a computing device of some description, and the trend has continued and
    is likely to rise. Its use in legal cases too has grown and shows no sign of diminishing.
    Digital evidence is derived from the examination of a wide range of digital devices
    and shares similar characteristics with other forms of evidence. There are some
    differences that enhance evidence recovery analysis, but, as will be seen in this
    book, there are characteristics that also make it challenging for practitioners.

    devices; in fact, it is anything that has a microchip or has been processed by
    one and then stored on other media. Digital data is a numerical representation
    that is usually in binary form, as distinct from electronic data stored in analog
    form. It has been alleged that an Australian narcotics trafficker concealed a
    spreadsheet of his customers and transactions inside a microchip implanted in
    his pet dog. It was uncovered when a canny police officer queried the presence
    of a microchip implant gun, readily available online for a modest cost, in the
    suspect's premises. This discovery prompted minor surgery on the dog to remove
    the tag, which was later found to contain the incriminating information in the
    form of a spreadsheet containing a list of narcotics dealers and transactions.

    witness testimony or direct evidence, or indirect evidence in the form of an object,
    such as physical documents, the property owned by persons, and so forth. Evidence
    in electronic form, including digital and analog data, is defined as real evidence
    and sometimes as documentary evidence. It has also been referred to as IT evidence,
    electronic evidence, or computer evidence. Digital evidence includes e-mails,
    electronic documents, spreadsheets, databases, system logs, and audio, picture,
    and video files, amongst others. The most common form of evidence presented to
    courts is spoken word by practitioners when providing interpretations of digital
    evidence.

    as well as proving the plausibility of disputed facts—most notably, circumstantial
    evidence or indirect evidence. Digital evidence, just like documentary evidence,
    provides inferences that may assist in proving some key fact of the case. It helps
    investigators and legal teams develop reliable hypotheses or theories as to the
    perpetrator of a crime. Its usefulness is apparent in establishing a link between
    a crime, the victim, and the perpetrator of that crime. The reliability of the
    evidence is paramount to supporting or refuting any hypothesis put forward as
    to the involvement of possible suspects. We will look at this more in [Chapter

    case and the devices from which the evidence is recovered. In the past, the most
    common recoveries have been from desktop and laptop computers and network servers.
    Digital evidence collected assists in both criminal and civil cases and, on occasion,
    may be the only evidence tendered. Recovery from desktop and laptop computers
    was generally performed by physically removing the hard drive from the source
    device and connecting it to the practitioner's computer. To prevent or minimize
    contamination of the suspect's source device, we can use a hardware device called
    a **write blocker** on the suspect's device so as to copy data potentially holding
    evidence. The use of hardware and software write-blocking tools and processes
    is described in detail in [Chapter 4](ch04.html "Chapter 4. Recovering and Preserving
    Digital Evidence"), *Recovering and Preserving Digital Evidence*.

    to the practitioner's target device. This is sometimes referred to as a physical
    copy of all data, as distinct from a logical copy, which will only copy what a
    user would normally see. Logical copies do not capture all the data, and the process
    will alter some file metadata to the extent that its forensic value is greatly
    diminished, resulting in possible legal challenge by the opposing legal team.
    Therefore, a full bit-for-bit copy is the preferred forensic process. The file
    created on the target device is called a **forensic image file** and various formats
    are available, including `.AFF`, `.ASB`, `.E01`, and `.dd` or raw image files,
    and virtual image formats such as `.VMDK` and `.VDI`.

    consider to be acceptable and unacceptable evidence. There are different categories
    of evidence tendered in legal proceedings. The most common is **direct evidence**,
    sometimes called **witness** or **testimonial** evidence. This is evidence of
    events observed by the witness and depends on the credibility of the witness in
    terms of the reliability of the witness's memory, honesty, objectivity, and so
    on. Such witness testimony may be challenged and refuted, but it often goes a
    long way in establishing the truth of a matter before the court.

    as it is often called. It may be something the witness directly heard, felt, smelled,
    tasted, or touched, but it must not be **hearsay evidence** or layperson opinion.
    Hearsay evidence is any matter relevant to a case that a witness has not observed
    personally through the five senses.

    that has not been directly observed by the witness. For example, if a police officer
    is informed by a witness of an offense that has taken place and apprehends the
    perpetrator, the officer cannot provide evidence of what the witness observed
    and has made a claim about. Such evidence from the officer would be rejected as
    it would be considered unreliable. The witness may tell the court what was observed,
    not the officer. Courts do not consider hearsay to be credible, particularly as
    the courts are denied the ability to cross-examine for determining witness credibility.

    certain assurances as to the reliability and accuracy of the computer that created
    and recorded the information. Courts also require some proof that the creation
    and storage of these records are part of the organization's business activities.

    documentary evidence is not submitted in isolation but corroborates or is corroborated

    percent of documents are stored in digital format. This creates significant difficulties
    in detecting any alteration to the data, requiring practitioners to link transgressors
    to initiating events or to some conclusive statement through an unambiguous trail
    of evidence. This sounds fine in theory, but often pieces of evidence are missing
    or erased and a complete chain of evidence is not always available. The file metadata

    attacks. It can be a formidable prospect for practitioners to be aware of such

    on the crime scene, different agents may be present that can destroy or at least
    alter evidence. Animal and insect scavengers, the elements, and earth disturbance
    can all affect the composition of a corpse. This may make it difficult to identify
    the body and estimate the time and cause of death.

    improper handling, even by the well-intentioned. Switching on a digital device
    will launch the operating system and various applications linked to the startup
    system. Switching off a device will erase the RAM and, worse still, may make it
    impossible to regain later access if the device is password protected and encrypted.
    Forensic tools are required to connect and gain access to the data stored on the

    stored data. [Chapter 4](ch04.html "Chapter 4. Recovering and Preserving Digital

    is critical in making a valid reconstruction of key events. The timestamps on
    all digital devices are an automated system that can often be adjusted manually.
    Laptop and desktop computers, for example, need to have the computer clock set
    when the device is first commissioned for use. Computer clocks are notoriously
    unreliable at sound timekeeping and require automatic synchronization with a reliable
    online service such as the **National Institute of Standards and Technology**
    (**NIST**). If the device has not been used for some time or there is no automatic
    synchronization, then it is more than likely that the computer clock has been
    running slow or fast. This discrepancy can increase exponentially and make the
    logs of file events unreliable. Some clocks may be running an hour faster or slower
    and, in some cases, this may be in terms of days or even years.

    jury to deliberate upon in terms of the weight that may be inferred from each
    evidence exhibit. Because of the technical complexity of digital evidence, judges
    have difficulty in determining whether to admit the evidence based on what they
    believe its relevance is. It is not uncommon for an overzealous or inexperienced
    practitioner to misinterpret or overinterpret evidence to suit the particular
    argument or hypothesis.

    onerous, as a court's determination of logical relevance is reviewed under a test
    applied to digital evidence, in much the same way as it would apply to more traditional
    evidence forms. The relevance test of digital evidence is intuitive and dismisses
    the view that digital evidence possesses some fundamentally mystic logical relevance.

    When acquiring and processing digital evidence, evidence may easily be contaminated
    and ruin other potential evidence stored on a device. It is normal practice for
    practitioners to make forensic images of each device, thereby facilitating the
    identification of further evidence through further analysis. There is a problem
    if the acquisition tools and forensic processes fail to preserve and lead to the
    contamination of evidence. Data may be overwritten or lost, and false information
    could be retrieved if some software program has been set as a booby trap to conceal
    or destroy evidence, for example.

    separation bonus assisted by the company accountant. The employee e-mailed the
    accountant to seek the CEO's approval requesting that the bonus be backdated to
    a time prior to the takeover of the company by a new owner. The letter of approval
    tendered to obtain payment was backdated but not received and paid to the employee
    until after the takeover by the new owner, who believed that it was a pre-takeover
    arrangement. What later attracted the attention of the new owner was the large
    amount of the bonus. Further inquiry revealed that the e-mail records between
    the employee and the accountant were deleted from the employee's computer, in
    itself thought a highly suspicious act by the new owners.

    of the creation of the letter approving the bonus was located on the accountant's
    or CEO's computers. Using forensic tools, the e-mails were partially recovered
    from the employee's computer and the bonus attachment was recovered from a deleted
    e-mail backup file (`.OST`). Staff members who had tried to piece together the
    e-mails on the two computers did so without any formal forensic knowledge and
    altered several related documents that had been attached to the incriminating
    e-mails. The last accessed and modified dates had been inadvertently altered,
    preventing a fuller reconstruction of user access to the documents.
  prefs: []

    access to the files after the computers had been returned by the employees could
    be made to suggest that the e-mails could have been altered or falsified by these
    staff members. It was possible to determine the document metadata from server
    records. However, the timestamps on the e-mails and documents, so crucial to prove
    a conspiracy to falsify the bonus claim and approval, were now compromised.

    an original signed document and saved in PDF format. This document had retained
    its creation date but no authorship details. It appeared that the CEO's electronic
    signature had appeared on the original document, which was not recovered. The
    dates appended to the signature were handwritten and pre-dated the sale of the
    company. The CEO's electronic signature was present on a number of other documents
    found in the accountant's e-mail files and could possibly have been added to the
    original text document prior to it being scanned.

    post-takeover and was confirmed to be a scanned document by virtue of its content
    and identification by the ILookIX scan-detection tool. The tool was able to open
    up volume shadow snapshots that recovered and deconstructed the e-mail backup
    file containing various deleted e-mails. These e-mails, corroborated by the more
    reliable records stored on the server, assisted in reconstructing the case antecedents,
    which could then be used in subsequent legal proceedings.

    the vulnerability of the data to deliberate and unintentional human action resulting
    in evidence contamination. Had the fraudster had the wit and opportunity to delete
    e-mails while still synchronized to the e-mail server, those records too would
    have been erased and not necessarily recovered. This also shows the need to ensure
    that e-mail servers keep a full record of all e-mail messages, even those deleted
    by users. A backup of the e-mail stores for defined periods is often a legislative
    requirement of government organizations. In many countries, this is mandatory
    for public companies, as enacted in the US under the far-reaching provisions of
    the Sarbannes-Oxley Act of 2002.
