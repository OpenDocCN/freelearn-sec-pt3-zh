- en: An examiner like you must not only know how to use forensic tools but must also
    understand the methods and acquisition techniques that are deployed by the tools
    you use in your investigations. Apart from saving time, forensic tools also make
    the process of forensic analysis a lot easier. However, each tool has its flaws.
    You must catch any mistakes and know how to correct them by leveraging another
    tool or technique. It's impossible for a tool to support all devices. You are
    responsible for learning and using the best tools to complete the job. As we discussed
    in the previous chapters, you must understand how data is stored on iOS devices
    to ensure that the tool is capturing all the accessible data.

    Analyzer, BlackBag BlackLight, Oxygen Forensic Detective, Belkasoft Evidence Center,
    MSAB XRY, Magnet AXIOM, and others, which are available for the forensic acquisition
    and analysis of iOS devices. For familiarity purposes, this chapter will walk
    you through the usage of a few of them and provide details on the steps required
    to perform acquisitions and the analysis of iOS devices.

    law enforcement, antiterrorism, and security organizations to capture critical
    forensic evidence from mobile phones, smartphones, PDAs, and portable handset
    varieties, including updates for newly released models. The tool enables forensically
    sound data extraction, decoding, and analysis techniques to obtain existing and
    deleted data from different mobile devices. As of February 2019, UFED supports
    data extraction from almost 28,000 mobile devices.

    different types of forensic artifacts from acquired images but also for performing
    both logical and filesystem (and even physical, for older devices) types of extraction
    from iOS devices. Due to the fact that physical acquisition is actually only for
    older devices, the best option is an advanced logical acquisition.

- en: Forensic tools are helpful for an examiner as they not only save time but also
    make the process a lot easier. However, not everyone has a budget large enough
    to purchase commercial tools to obtain iOS acquisition. While free tools exist
    for acquisition, support may be limited and multiple extractions may be required
    to obtain the same amount of data as a commercial tool.

- en: For jailbroken devices, the iOS device can be connected to a forensic workstation
    for live examination through SSH, which is how some of the tools acquire the necessary
    data. However, this is not a method that is recommended for those new to mobile
    forensics. For such purposes, this chapter introduced you to several available
    iOS forensic tools and included the steps you need to follow to perform acquisition
    and analysis.

- en: You should take further steps to validate and understand each tool that might
    be used as part of an investigation. We recommend that you acquire test devices
    with known data to ensure that nothing is overlooked, the evidence hasn't been
    altered, and that the methods provide you with access to the data of interest,
    where possible.
