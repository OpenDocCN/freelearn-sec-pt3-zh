                    <h1 class="header-title">Cybersecurity Labs</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Traditional teaching methods have been observed to be ineffective for cybersecurity training. Theoretical approaches just give details on some aspects of cybersecurity, but they rarely impart skills to the learner. This is why hands-on experience is required, so that a learner can apply the principles they have learned to a real-world environment. Hands-on training allows for skills to be learned more efficiently and learners can appreciate the importance of all the tiny details. For instance, a flaw in the configuration of a firewall could lead to a network breach.</p>
<p>The IT world is agile and requires people to rapidly acquire new knowledge. It is likely that you will keep acquiring new skills for the better part of your cybersecurity career as you adjust to new market trends. It is, therefore, of great importance to know the avenues that you can use to acquire new skills or grow your existing ones. The advantage of cybersecurity training is that you don't need to enroll in a college in order to learn. There are several platforms available on the internet where you can learn either free of charge, or for a small fee.</p>
<p>However, there are several concerns that you have to bear in mind when it comes to online training. One of them is that the choice you make will greatly affect your outcome. Therefore, choosing the wrong learning platform will serve to your disadvantage. In addition to this, your commitment to learning will always affect how well or quickly you learn new skills. If you are keen and focused, you will quickly acquire new knowledge and skills. Therefore, if you have challenges with concentrating for long periods of time, it is best to choose training that is led by an instructor. This chapter will give you an overview of three popular training options that you may choose from, depending on your preferences and abilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instructor-led training (ILT)</li>
<li>Virtual instructor-led training (VILT)</li>
<li>Self-study</li>
</ul>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">ILT</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>ILT is often referred to as a traditional learning method. This method involves the physical presence of an instructor who interacts with students, with the goal of imparting to them new skills or developing the skills that the instructor already possesses. Technology has made ILT quite easy. It is suitable for training where there are complex topics that require expert, hands-on experience.</p>
<p>In ILT, the training is offered in training circles. Students get to work together in the same physical space and they can assist each other with challenges. The collaboration between students often plays a key role in the success of this method of training. Students can interact with each other by sharing challenges, experiences, tips, and tricks that can make the training easier or more fun. The end effect is that complex topics become more accessible due to the synergy between the students.</p>
<p>The cons of this type of training include limited accessibility, as students usually have to travel to get to the training venue. Additionally, they have to proceed at the same pace. This method is also expensive, and most of the expenses cannot be evaded. The reach of this type of training is also limited because the trainer and students have to meet physically. However, institutions are also offering boot camp sessions, which are shorter training events that can be rotated regularly in different locations. This improves the reach and accessibility of the training program.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">VILT</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>This is an extension of ILT that is powered by the internet. In VILT, there are virtual instructor-led classes on the internet. Both students and instructors do not have to travel to attend a class since they can participate from anywhere provided that they have a stable internet connection. The institutions offering this training have the advantage of not having to rent rooms for students to study in. There is more flexibility with this learning model since students can take up other tasks before and after the classes. The classes are also more time-efficient and will start and end at predefined times. The quality of training can also be high, since the institution is able to hire qualified personnel from anywhere, as long as they have a reliable internet connection.</p>
<p>However, VILT comes with its own set of challenges. To begin with, it is virtual and, therefore, comes with self-discipline requirements for the learners. Students have to avoid distractions such as phones while the training is going on. It is tempting for students, without physical supervision, to wander away from the training and be distracted by other things in their environment. Some estimates show that the attention-span for a VILT is 25%. This means that many students do wander off during the training session. The scope for interacting with instructors is also limited. This type of training tends to have many students per session, reducing the chance for each student to voice their concerns or ask questions to the instructor. The instructor is also unable to connect with the students. This is because one of the ways instructors know whether students understand what is being taught is by looking at their body language. VILT does not offer the best medium for instructors to observe non-verbal communication from their students. Finally, there is a limitation to the practicality of this type of training. Students are sent resources through PDFs, video clips, or manuals. However, these resources are not always optimized for different screen sizes and it can be uncomfortable for some students to actually follow the training.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Self-study</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>This is where learners follow text-based or video training modules and learn at their own pace. It requires self-discipline from the learner, in terms of time management and willingness to complete challenges in the lessons.</p>
<p>The benefits of this type of learning are numerous and range from flexibility to cost-effectiveness. In this type of training, the student does not have to go at the pace of other students or that of the trainer. Fast learners will complete it quickly, while slow learners will have the chance to stretch their learning timelines over a longer duration so that they can grasp what is being taught. This method of learning is also cost-effective. Institutions that offer self-study modules often price them cheaply or for free. For instance, you can learn many skills by watching and using YouTube tutorials, which are free of charge. A course that might cost thousands of dollars to take in college could be priced at under $1,000.</p>
<p>Self-study and assessment modules have been gaining traction due to the large number of people that want to learn at their own pace and convenience. Cybersecurity is seeing an increase in the number of experts due to these learning platforms. The industry is quickly responding to the shortage in the number of trained specialists. Projections suggest that in 2020, there will be a shortage of 1.5 million cybersecurity personnel, but this might just be averted.</p>
<p>One of the best methods for doing self-study and assessment in cybersecurity is through online cybersecurity labs. These expose you to real-world threats that you will have to respond to. There is a wide selection of labs that you can perform on the internet. However, some of them are costly.</p>
<p>This chapter focuses on the cheaper alternatives where you can set up and utilize security labs free of charge. It explores labs that are meant to improve your mastery of different types of threats and their resolutions.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Self-study cybersecurity labs</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>We will now discuss a number of online platforms that a cybersecurity professional can use for learning purposes. Some of the tools that will be covered are live and require authorization from the target to use. Therefore, exercise caution and do not run tests on highly sensitive or highly guarded websites. The end goal is to learn more about cybersecurity, so do focus on the results or reports given at the end of each exercise.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">The cross-site scripting (XSS) lab</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>To begin with, a simple security lab that you can carry out is an XSS attack, which can be found at <a href="https://pentest-tools.com/website-vulnerability-scanning/xss-scanner-online">https://pentest-tools.com/website-vulnerability-scanning/xss-scanner-online</a>:</p>
<div><img src="img/cd33a0a0-0091-4fa0-b71f-7d4ea095e9fd.png" style="width:38.92em;height:19.83em;"/></div>
<p>Figure 1: The landing page for XSS Scanner</p>
<p>The XSS online scanner is a free online tool that is used for detecting XSS attacks and vulnerabilities on websites. In XSS attacks, hackers inject malicious JavaScript in trusted websites. The script can then be used to harm the affected websites and their visitors in a number of ways, such as by reading sensitive page content, injecting malicious scripts, cookie stealing, and website defacement.</p>
<p>The security lab is quite simple to carry out, since you are only expected to have a URL of a website to be scanned. The scanner will go through the provided website by trying to identify all the pages that have exploitable avenues for XSS attacks, such as contact forms and search boxes. The tool will then attempt XSS attacks on each of the potentially vulnerable pages. The scanner will then give a report of its findings concerning the XSS vulnerabilities that were found on the entire website.</p>
<p>The XSS scanner supports light and full scans. A light scan is less comprehensive as the maximum number of URLs that can be scanned is set at 20 and the maximum active scan duration is two minutes. The full scan is more comprehensive and can support a maximum of 500 URLs and a scan duration of 30 minutes.</p>
<p>To perform a scan, a user is required to provide three parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>The URL of the web application to be scanned</li>
<li>The type of scan</li>
<li>Confirmation that they have the authorization to scan the target application</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to note that the scanner generates HTTP requests that can be flagged as attacks on the server side, although they are not harmful. This is why you should mostly use the XSS Scanner on authorized targets to avoid prosecution for security violations. The tool provides a detailed report of identified XSS vulnerabilities or attacks. The report can then be used to fix the vulnerabilities before attackers can exploit them.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">The Secure Socket Layer (SSL) configuration lab</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>This is a cybersecurity lab that is offered by Wormly. You can refer to it at <a href="https://www.wormly.com/test_ssl">https://www.wormly.com/test_ssl</a>. It allows you to conduct a deep analysis of the SSL configuration of a web server. This is an important test since misconfigured SSL can introduce security vulnerabilities that can be exploited by cybercriminals to steal data that is stored, sent, or received by the server or can be exploited to carry out <strong>Denial of Service</strong> (<strong>DoS</strong>) attacks. Additionally, a misconfigured SSL web server can slow down websites, thereby degrading a user's experience.</p>
<p>In this lab, a cybersecurity expert can identify the security configuration weaknesses or errors in web servers. It is important to note that SSL certificates are vital for securing communication between web clients and web servers. The SSL certificate ensures that all data that is exchanged between a web server and a browser is kept private and secure through encryption:</p>
<div><img src="img/134ba6b7-d675-4c49-9f0f-e2a26d68fa85.png" style="width:30.08em;height:28.58em;"/></div>
<p>Figure 2: The Wormly SSL server test tool user interface</p>
<p>Wormly offers a simplified interface where you can enter either the URL or public IP address of the web application whose SSL server is to be scanned. You can then click on the Start SSL test button to begin the test.</p>
<p>The tool provides important information about the SSL certificate that is in use, such as validity duration and trust level. The report also includes security information such as whether the encryption ciphers in use are strong, the public key size, the security protocols in use, and their version and performance information, such as SSL handshake size, TLS stateless resume, and SSL session cache. This information allows you to identify any weaknesses in SSL configuration so that appropriate measures can be taken to correct the weaknesses before criminals can exploit them. A cybersecurity expert will easily interpret and fix the errors that this tool highlights.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Acunetix Vulnerability Scanner</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>This is a security auditing tool that can be found at <a href="https://www.acunetix.com/vulnerability-scanner">https://www.acunetix.com/vulnerability-scanner</a>. It is used by cybersecurity professionals to identify vulnerabilities in web applications that are hosted on the cloud. The use of web applications has increased over the last decade. At the same time, criminals are exploiting the vulnerabilities that are in internet protocols to cause havoc and to benefit financially by stealing confidential information that is sold on the black market. This tool, therefore, provides webmasters or cybersecurity professionals with a free cloud-based system that they can use to detect two of the most common vulnerabilities in web applications. The free version of the tool has limited functionalities compared to the paid version, but it can still provide valuable information that can be used to harden a given web application.</p>
<p>The tool offers an interface with a control panel where a user can select the type of scan, the vulnerabilities to be scanned, reports, settings, and the target system. After a user provides the required information, the scan is conducted and a detailed report outlining the detected vulnerabilities is generated. The security tool also suggests suitable actions that a user can take to remedy the loopholes.</p>
<p>Acunetix is a useful security tool that can detect more than 4,500 web application vulnerabilities. Moreover, it can scan open source and custom-built applications to detect security loopholes that can be used to compromise the security of web applications. Acunetix online scanner can also scan perimeter servers for weaknesses and give suggestions on the appropriate cause of action to rectify these weaknesses. The security tool is, therefore, an effective security tool for detecting and rectifying security weaknesses in web applications.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Sucuri</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Sucuri is another free online malware that can be viewed at <a href="https://sitecheck.sucuri.net/">https://sitecheck.sucuri.net/</a>. It is a security scanner that cybersecurity professionals can use to find out the vulnerabilities in a website. The system provides an interface where users enter the URL of the websites to be scanned. The security tool will then scan the websites for known malware, blacklisting status, errors, and out-of-date software.</p>
<p>The Sucuri system can also be used to ensure that a given web application is clean, fast, and protected. In case malware is detected, the concerned security profession will be able to delete it so that the performance and security of the application are not compromised. The security tool can also detect out-of-date software, such as content management systems, which are common sources of security vulnerability. It will, therefore, be possible to update the software to secure versions in order to minimize exposure to security risks.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Valhalla</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Valhalla is a comprehensive online cybersecurity lab. You can visit its website at <a href="https://halls-of-valhalla.org/beta/challenges">https://halls-of-valhalla.org/beta/challenges</a>. <a href="https://halls-of-valhalla.org/beta/challenges"/>It allows users to undertake various security-related challenges for points. The challenges offered by the website include SQL injection, debugging, encryption, XSS, and reconnaissance. In reconnaissance, users are required to gather intelligence about a given target. Reconnaissance plays a big role in penetration testing, which forms the bulk of a cybersecurity career.</p>
<p>The goal of penetration testing is to discover the security loopholes in a given system, so that they can be rectified to reduce exposure to security risks. For this process to succeed, you must have adequate intelligence about the target. Intelligence gathering is, therefore, an important step in penetration testing and the Valhalla security lab will offer various services that will give you a hands-on experience on intelligence gathering. The reconnaissance challenge has three tasks for you to complete and to then check whether your answers are correct. The other cybersecurity labs feature the same layout of three labs. In all the challenges, the site offers hints and support that a user can utilize to complete the given tasks. A user is also allowed to access successfully completed solutions so that they can learn from them. The following screenshot shows the Valhalla user interface:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/4d379bf6-345d-4bdf-b3fa-395b66116dc7.png"/></p>
<p>Figure 3: The Valhalla user interface</p>
<p>The user is required to go to the Valhalla website and select the category of challenges that they want to attempt. The user will then select the level and begin working on the challenge. For example, a user may be required to gather appropriate intelligence that can enable them to find out the login credentials of one of the accounts in the system. Using this information, the user will gain access to the system and proceed to gather more intelligence that will allow them access to confidential information.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">F-Secure Router Checker</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>This is a networking security lab that helps you to check whether a router has been hijacked by cybercriminals. It can be found at <a href="https://www.f-secure.com/en/web/home_global/router-checker">https://www.f-secure.com/en/web/home_global/router-checker</a>. A common threat today is DNS hijacking; one of the ways in which it is carried out is through unauthorized modifications of a router's configurations so that a third party can monitor, control, or redirect the traffic that is passing through the router. This security lab teaches you how to easily check whether a router has fallen victim to DNS hijacking. This knowledge can help victims stop attacks early enough before any significant damage is done. For example, in a situation where a router's DNS has been hijacked, a quick test using this tool will detect the attack and recommend an appropriate cause of action. This will prevent a user from being redirected to fake versions of genuine sites, such as in online banking, where their records or login credentials can be stolen and used to access their bank accounts. The tool is also important because it detects vulnerabilities or misconfigured settings in routers that can be exploited by criminals to harm users.</p>
<p>F-Secure Router Checker provides the interface shown in the following screenshot to allow users to analyze the settings of their routers for vulnerabilities. A user, therefore, needs to access the F-Secure website, and then select Online Tools and they will be directed to the router checker tool. Provided that they are connected to the internet, they just need to click on the Check your router button to start the analysis. After a few minutes, a report with the relevant information regarding the health of the router will be displayed with appropriate suggestions on how the issues can be rectified. The tool offers more tests for other devices, but these are offered at a subscription fee and so they might not be ideal for learning purposes:</p>

<p>Now, let's explore Hacking-Lab in the next section to further strengthen our knowledge base.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Hacking-Lab</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Hacking-Lab can be visited at <a href="https://www.hacking-lab.com/Remote_Sec_Lab/">https://www.hacking-lab.com/Remote_Sec_Lab/</a>. Hacking-Lab is a free online ethical hacking lab that offers a virtual platform where you can conduct penetration tests. The tool also incorporates several computer network and security challenges that you can attempt in order to build hands-on experience on various networking and security aspects. Hacking-Lab's goal is to promote awareness of ethics in information security. This is achieved using cybersecurity competitions that test important aspects of cybersecurity such as forensics, cryptography, reverse engineering, and cyber defense. The tool is provided for free to foster an environment that creates cyber protection by equipping cybersecurity professionals with relevant knowledge and skills. The tool is also licensed to a number of universities worldwide for educational purposes with the goal of building young cyber talent that can meet the needs of the current business environment and encourage learners to pursue careers in cybersecurity.</p>
<p>The following screenshot shows the Hacking-Labs dashboard; there is also a section on Security Events, which lists events that you can join, such as free hacking challenges. Most of these events are delivered online and, therefore, you don't need any special software to undertake the cybersecurity challenges. To use the lab, you just need to register your Hacking-Lab account and then register for a free hacking challenge event that is running. A lot can be learned from the challenges, as they simulate how criminals take advantage of the vulnerabilities in applications in order to compromise their security. You can, therefore, gain hands-on experience of how to identify security loopholes in applications, and learn about the measures, such as system hardening, that can be taken to minimize exposure to various security risks:</p>

<p>Now that you've gained an insight into Hacking-Lab, let's move our focus to the Root Me password generator.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">The Root Me password generator</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The Root Me password generator can be visited at <a href="https://www.root-me.org/spip.php?page=outils&amp;inc=password&amp;lang=en">https://www.root-me.org/spip.php?page=outils&amp;amp;inc=password&amp;amp;lang=en</a>. To date, weak passwords are still a major threat to the security of organizational data and systems. The Root Me password generator is a security tool used to generate user passwords that users can then use to gain access to their account. The following screenshot shows the user interface for the password generator. There are a number of fields that a user is required to enter, such as password length and additional characters, before clicking on the Generate password button. The tool will then use brute force to try and guess the correct password for a given user account. This tool is important because when conducting a penetration test, it is common for a user to try and access accounts with weak passwords. The tool will, therefore, be used to identify weak passwords and develop an effective password policy that will ensure that users select passwords that cannot be hacked using common password hacking tools:</p>

<p>In the next section, we will explore the essentials of CTF365.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">CTF365</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>CTF365 can be visited at <a href="https://ctf365.com/">https://ctf365.com/</a>. CTF365 is a cybersecurity training gamification tool that offers numerous real-life games where players build the defenses for their systems, such as virtual private servers, in order to defend them from attacks. At the same time, the players try to attack systems developed by others in the network. This tool is useful because it simulates what happens in real life, as far as cybersecurity is concerned. Security professionals are expected to build and protect computer systems that are constantly under attack by criminals trying to destroy, modify, or steal data from systems. CTF365 uses a fun, entertaining, challenging, and community-driven approach to equip security professionals with the skills they need to be effective in the current information-security field.</p>
<p>According to the developers of the security training tool, the best way to learn is through applications. Gamification excels in this aspect by increasing the learner's engagement and improving their retention rate and the speed of their learning curve. The tool is free for not-for-profit information security conferences. You can also enjoy a 30-day trial period for individual use and training. To participate, all that is required is the installation of OpenVPN to use the security tool. Moreover, you need two important files: your VPN username and password file and your config file. The two files should be copied to the following location: <kbd>C:\Program files\OpenVPN\config\</kbd>. Then, search in Windows for <kbd>OpenVPN GUI</kbd>, right-click on it, and select Run as an administrator. After the tool starts, you should right-click on the OpenVPN GUI icon and select Connect. This will allow you to connect to CTF365 and build the necessary systems and their defenses for practice and, at the same time, try to attack the systems developed by others in the community.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Mozilla Observatory</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>You can access Mozilla Observatory at <a href="https://observatory.mozilla.org/">https://observatory.mozilla.org/</a>. Mozilla Observatory is a free and open source website security scanner that works on top of a Python code base. Mozilla claims that the tool has helped over 125,000 security professionals to configure their sites in a secure manner. It is, therefore, a great avenue for cybersecurity enthusiasts to learn. To use the tool, you just need to copy and paste the URL or domain name of a website into the Observatory, and then click on the Scan Me button. A scan will be conducted and a security report about the website will then be presented. The report includes important security elements such as OWASP header security and TSL best practices. The Observatory is also capable of performing third-party tests from SSL Labs, High-Tech Bridge, and HSTS preload. The security tool also provides links to quality resources that can be used to rectify the identified security issues.</p>
<p>The report is useful for web developers and security admins because it allows them to identify the vulnerabilities on their websites, thus making them safer. A big advantage of this tool is that a user can also schedule automatic security scans after a certain duration. This helps in the monitoring of the website, as the user is notified if their website has any newly developed security issues.</p>

<p>Everything begins with having the right hardware, which, at the very least, supports virtualization. If you have Windows 8 or 10 Pro, then you can just use the built-in Hyper-V. For this, you will need to learn how to install a <strong>virtual machine</strong> (<strong>VM</strong>) and a hypervisor, which is typically done in Microsoft Hyper-V, Oracle VirtualBox, or VMware (Fusion and Workstation are not free):</p>
<ul>
<li>How to install Hyper-V in Windows 10: <a href="https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/canitpro/2015/09/08/step-by-step-enabling-hyper-v-for-use-on-windows-10/">https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/canitpro/2015/09/08/step-by-step-enabling-hyper-v-for-use-on-windows-10/</a></li>
<li>How to install Oracle VirtualBox: <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E26217_01/E26796/html/qs-create-vm.html">https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E26217_01/E26796/html/qs-create-vm.html</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have done this, you will need to start setting up a network. The following links will help you to get started.</p>
<p>The preceding URLs can help you set the network up as well. For the attacking machine, you can set up a Kali box or download a pre-built image from OffensiveSecurity at <a href="https://www.offensive-security.com/kali-linux-vmware-virtualbox-image-download/">https://www.offensive-security.com/kali-linux-vmware-virtualbox-image-download/</a>.</p>
<p>To learn more about firewalls, go to the pfSense website, which can be found at <a href="https://pfsense.org/download/">https://pfsense.org/download/</a>. Additionally, you can refer to the guides that you find on the internet, or to books that will help you to install other machines that will expand your lab environment (Packt Publishing has a number of great books on this topic). <a href="https://pfsense.org/download/"/></p>
<p>For instance, you could install an Ubuntu VM and set it up as a DNS server. Afterward, you could install a CentOS VM and use it as your web server with the appropriate Apache (or Nginx), MySQL, and PHP/Perl/Python (LAMP stack) software. Optionally, you could use the pre-built images from the websites listed, or install some of the applications on the newly-deployed VMs. The following links will give you ready-to-use VM images that you can deploy in your lab:</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Summary</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>In this chapter, we looked at an avenue for training through cybersecurity labs. It began with a cross-examination of the types of online learning methods and discussed ILT, VILT, and self-study. We then explored the benefits of self-study and why it is gaining wide acceptance in the cybersecurity industry. This method of learning is also helping to address the shortage of sufficiently trained skillsets in the cybersecurity field. Additionally, a number of online cybersecurity labs are available, both free and paid, but this chapter focused on the free labs that anyone can perform without spending a dime. The first lab is an XSS exercise that can be used to figure out whether a website has components that are vulnerable to XSS. The next lab is an SSL test to check whether a website is running on a server with misconfigured SSL. The third test is a cloud-based vulnerability scan that can be used to detect more than 4,500 vulnerabilities in web applications.</p>
<p>The fourth lab is a malware scanning tool that could be used to detect whether a website has any known malware, outdated software, or other security errors. The fifth tool is more comprehensive, as it features a platform offering a number of cybersecurity challenges that a user can try solving. The sixth lab is a network security tool that cybersecurity professionals can use to check whether a router is a victim of DNS hijacking. The seventh is another comprehensive lab where users can participate in a number of challenges from an attacker's perspective and exploit vulnerabilities in dummy targets. The eighth lab focuses on password security and gives learners a chance to try and generate passwords that users are likely to create and use in systems. Here, you can check a number of parameters and provide certain characters that are likely to be in a password, and the tool will generate highly-probable passwords.</p>
<p>The ninth lab is a gamification cybersecurity training platform in which the user can create systems and defend them from attacks. Alongside this, they can also attack systems created by other users on the platform. The last lab was a tool from Mozilla, called Mozilla Observatory. The tool is a website security scanner that generates in-depth reports on the vulnerabilities that are on a website. These labs are a sure way for a cybersecurity enthusiast to continue learning and assess their skills. Some of the labs might not be too engaging, as they feature automated tests. However, the reports generated are important. You should try and find out how the details contained in the lab reports affect the website.</p>
<p>Finally, there are many other cybersecurity training platforms that you can use to advance your knowledge. Some of the best platforms charge a premium to allow you to carry out simulations, but it could be worthwhile trying out these premium platforms. However, you should at least consider doing a number of the free labs to get a preview of what to expect from the premium tools. Cybersecurity is quite involving, and a career in this field will always be filled with new learning opportunities. You should, therefore, be proactive in trying out any other security lab that you come across.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, we will take a close look at the various knowledge checks and certifications that are quintessential to kickstarting your career in cybersecurity.</p>
