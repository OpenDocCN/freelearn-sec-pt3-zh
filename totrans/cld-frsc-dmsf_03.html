<h3 id="_idParaDest-24" class="calibre6"><a id="_idTextAnchor028" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/>Trends in Cyber and Privacy Laws and Their Impact on DFIR</h3>
<p class="calibre3">When considering the cloud, organizations must factor in the legal risks associated with their data being hosted off-premises by a third-party cloud service provider. As a result, there is also a direct implication for the availability of forensic artifacts, what artifacts can be acquired or accessed outside of a particular country, and so on. Jurisdiction plays a key role in cloud forensics. This chapter aims to uncover the legal, privacy, and contractual risks that typically arise out of cloud usage and its impact on <span>forensic investigations.</span></p>

<h1 id="_idParaDest-25" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor029" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/>The role of a breach counselor (breach coach)</h1>
<p class="calibre3">A breach counselor (also known as a breach coach) is an attorney with expertise in cybersecurity and<a id="_idIndexMarker078" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/> related legal frameworks. A breach counselor’s responsibility is to understand the data hosted by an affected organization and develop an understanding of the respective legal implications for the organization because of the cybersecurity incident or breach. Typically, breach coaches are retained when there is a risk of litigation due to the impact of the security incident or breach (for example, unauthorized disclosure of private and sensitive data leading to identity fraud against customers) and as a result, breach coaches provide recommendations and legal advice to the affected organization as they navigate and respond to <span>the incident.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">Breach coaches can also represent the organization in a court of law should the matter go to court, but in most cases, an organization retains breach coaches to identify the organization’s legal obligations to report the incident in due course and to limit the chances <span>of litigation.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">For breach coaches to provide legal advice to the affected organization, breach coaches work with DFIR teams to identify the nature and cause of the cybersecurity incident, the extent of private or sensitive data disclosure, and any additional insights in relation to the cyber incident itself. To ensure all the parties in a cybersecurity incident (the breach coach, the organization, and the DFIR team) can freely communicate with each other about the cyber incident without the risk of such communications being disclosed, breach coaches exercise<a id="_idIndexMarker079" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/> something called <strong class="bold">solicitor-client privilege</strong> or <strong class="bold">litigation privilege</strong>. Solicitor-client <a id="_idIndexMarker080" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/>privilege or attorney-client privilege protects the communication between the organization, lawyer, and DFIR team. Where the communication is intended to be privileged and confidential, it is protected from disclosure, unless the communication is <a id="_idIndexMarker081" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/>deemed to be factual in nature, in which case the privilege may not be exercised in <span>certain jurisdictions.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">Litigation privilege preserves the documents and communications specifically drafted for the purpose of litigation, for example, a cybersecurity forensic report prepared at the instruction of <span>legal counsel.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">There can be one or more breach coaches retained by an organization, depending upon the countries/jurisdictions in which the organization <span>does business.</span></p>
<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>
<p class="callout">It is very important that digital forensic investigators familiarize themselves with the various legal regulations and frameworks that are applicable across jurisdictions, along with the role of a breach coach. Where required, DFIR teams should consult breach coaches/counselors to ensure appropriate legal compliance when collecting, analyzing, or handling forensic artifacts that may contain <span>sensitive information.</span></p>

<h1 id="_idParaDest-26" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor030" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/>General legal considerations for cloud adoption</h1>
<p class="calibre3">The legal framework<a id="_idIndexMarker082" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/> for the cloud and its adoption varies from one country to another, but at a high level, here are some of the common concepts that are typically considered with respect to a <span>legal framework:</span></p>

<ul class="calibre12">
<li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">Data protection and privacy</strong>: As of 2023, the majority of organizations will have to consider the<a id="_idIndexMarker083" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/> concerns around securing their data hosted in the cloud. Regulations such as, but<a id="_idIndexMarker084" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/> not limited to, the <strong class="bold">General Data Protection Regulation</strong> (<strong class="bold">GDPR</strong>) in the <strong class="bold">European Union</strong> (<strong class="bold">EU</strong>) and the <strong class="bold">California Consumer Privacy Act</strong> (<strong class="bold">CCPA</strong>) in the <strong class="bold">United States (US)</strong> outline how personal data must be handled and protected in the cloud. Some of these data protection and privacy laws may also restrict digital forensic investigators from transferring artifacts outside of <span>respective jurisdictions:</span><ul class="calibre17"><li class="calibre13">GDPR in the EU sets out specific rules for the protection of personal data, which also include instructions that the processing of personal information shall be done lawfully, fairly, and transparently within the EU, and that individuals have the right to access, rectify, and erase their personal information. This means that you cannot transfer any artifacts as part of an investigation outside of the EU (GDPR enforcement) zone, and will be required to set up and<a id="_idIndexMarker085" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/> conduct your forensic investigation locally within the EU region. Investigators may also be required to work with their EU counterparts instead, to comply with GDPR requirements. Even if you can access the artifacts from anywhere in the world, GDPR requires that any artifacts that may contain personal information are physically located/stored within <span>the EU.</span></li><li class="calibre13">CCPA also outlines some of the considerations for incident investigations where personal information is involved. It is similar to GDPR in stating that artifacts must be collected lawfully, meaning there should be a legal basis on which to collect these artifacts (which may contain personal information, health information, and so on), and investigate. CCPA also requires investigators to comply with deletion requests for personal information that may be collected as part of investigations, and investigators are required to apply the necessary security controls to prevent the unauthorized access to, or destruction or modification of, artifacts <span>during investigations.</span></li></ul></li>
<li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">Cyber risk management</strong>: As the cloud is always available (online), it constantly poses a security<a id="_idIndexMarker086" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/> risk, including the risk of data breaches and cyber-attacks. Legal frameworks and guidelines <a id="_idIndexMarker087" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/>often require <strong class="bold">Cloud Service Providers</strong> (<strong class="bold">CSPs</strong>) to implement security measures and risk management strategies to protect against risk. These typically include CSPs having appropriate risk management documentation, including incident response plans, to ensure CSPs are familiar with the procedures for detecting, containing, and recovering from <span>an incident.</span>
<p class="calibre3">Businesses or cloud service consumers are also required to establish their own risk management program prior to embarking on cloud adoption. This also means that businesses <a id="_idIndexMarker088" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/>work with CSPs to define an appropriate incident response plan (clearly outlining the roles and responsibilities between the CSP and business), deploy specialized tooling to protect, detect, and <a id="_idIndexMarker089" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/>support investigations in the cloud (for example, an <strong class="bold">Endpoint Detection and Response</strong> (<strong class="bold">EDR</strong>) tool) in the event of a cyber incident, and develop in-house or outsourced (on a retainer) experts who are familiar with <span>cloud infrastructure.</span></p>
</li>
<li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">Compliance</strong>: Cloud<a id="_idIndexMarker090" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/> computing must comply with a range of regulations, such as industry-specific regulations (GDPR for <a id="_idIndexMarker091" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/>protecting EU citizens’ private information), financial regulations (<strong class="bold">Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard</strong> (<strong class="bold">PCI DSS</strong>)), and healthcare regulations (<strong class="bold">Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act</strong> (<strong class="bold">HIPAA</strong>) or <strong class="bold">Health Information Trust Alliance</strong> (<strong class="bold">HITRUST</strong>)). Legal frameworks and guidelines may set requirements for CSPs to comply with <span>these regulations.</span>
<p class="calibre3">Furthermore, if your services are offered to US government agencies, then your cloud infrastructure<a id="_idIndexMarker092" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/> must be shown to comply with the <strong class="bold">Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program</strong> (<strong class="bold">FedRAMP</strong>). The FedRAMP program provides a standardized approach and framework for security assessments, access control and authorizations, and the continuous monitoring of cloud infrastructure services, to ensure CSPs achieve the necessary security compliance prior to offering services to US government agencies. Compliance with FedRAMP ensures digital forensic investigators access to any necessary logs and artifacts, as FedRAMP outlines requirements for CSPs to maintain logs and artifacts, preserve evidence for forensic analysis, and comply with the appropriate legal and regulatory mandates. However, it is important to note that CSPs do not need to show FedRAMP compliance for all their service offerings (entire <span>cloud products).</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">Cloud services/products are typically a subset of specialized and curated cloud service offerings that comply with FedRAMP and are specifically designed to cater to US government agencies who would like to leverage cloud services. It is therefore<a id="_idIndexMarker093" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/> important for investigators to recognize whether the cloud service or product offering that is the subject of an investigation is compliant with FedRAMP or not, as the availability of artifacts and logs for investigation may vary significantly as <span>a result.</span></p>
</li>
<li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">Applicable jurisdiction</strong>: Cloud computing can involve data processing and storage in multiple<a id="_idIndexMarker094" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/> jurisdictions, which can raise questions about jurisdictional authority and legal requirements. Legal frameworks and guidelines may address these issues and set requirements for cross-border <span>data transfers.</span></li>
<li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">Contractual considerations</strong>: Cloud computing often involves contractual agreements between <a id="_idIndexMarker095" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/>CSPs and their customers. Legal frameworks and guidelines may set requirements for these agreements, such as the inclusion of specific provisions related to data protection, security, <span>and liability.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="calibre3">In summary, organizations must recognize the legal guardrails to protect the privacy of the information stored within their systems as they transition to the cloud. It is important that they safeguard and implement appropriate controls to prevent the accidental or unauthorized disclosure of private and sensitive information. For DFIR teams, it is important that they understand the compliance requirements to support the organization’s cloud transition. Similarly, as part of the investigation into a cybersecurity incident, understanding the legal requirements and their goals will enable the DFIR teams to focus their investigation on identifying the root cause and impact of the breach of private or sensitive information, and to plan appropriate mitigation to prevent reoccurrence of <span>security incidents.</span></p>

<h1 id="_idParaDest-27" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor031" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/>eDiscovery considerations and legal guidance</h1>
<p class="calibre3"><strong class="bold">eDiscovery</strong>, or <strong class="bold">electronic discovery</strong>, refers to<a id="_idIndexMarker096" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/> identifying, collecting, preserving, and producing data stored in digital formats or electronic storage as part of a legal or regulatory investigation. This includes searching for <strong class="bold">electronically stored information</strong> (<strong class="bold">ESI</strong>) such as emails, documents, datasets, and any other<a id="_idIndexMarker097" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/> digital content with specialized tools and software. The legal framework and guidelines for eDiscovery are constantly evolving, but there are several key standards and guidelines that are widely recognized and used in the industry. In digital forensics, ESI plays a key role in investigating digital crimes or intellectual property theft. Digital forensic investigators rely on ESI for reconstructing the activities of a threat actor, determining the source of the breach, or identifying any suspects. eDiscovery is a critical component of this process as it requires investigators to collect, preserve, and analyze in a forensically sound and legally defensible manner. Outlined in the following bullet list are some of the most accepted standards <span>for ESI:</span></p>

<ul class="calibre12">
<li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">International Organization for Standardization/International Electrotechnical Commission (ISO/IEC) 27050: ISO/IEC 27050</strong>: This standard provides a <a id="_idIndexMarker098" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/>comprehensive framework for managing ESI during eDiscovery processes. It is designed to help organizations ensure that they are complying with legal and regulatory requirements related to eDiscovery, while also protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive data. Some of the key elements of ISO/IEC 27050 include <span>the following:</span><ul class="calibre17"><li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">Identification</strong>: This<a id="_idIndexMarker099" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/> phase involves identifying the relevant ESI that may be subject to a legal request or investigation. This includes data that is stored on servers, in emails, on mobile devices, or in other <span>digital formats.</span></li><li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">Preservation</strong>: Once the relevant ESI has been identified, it must be preserved to ensure that it is <a id="_idIndexMarker100" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/>not altered or destroyed. This may involve making copies of data prior to any review or investigation, implementing legal holds, or restricting access to certain data, ensuring the data cannot be destroyed <span>by anyone.</span></li><li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">Collection</strong>: After the ESI has <a id="_idIndexMarker101" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/>been preserved, it must be collected and analyzed to determine its relevance to the legal request or investigation. This may involve searching for specific keywords or phrases, reviewing metadata, or using forensic tools to extract data from <span>digital devices.</span></li><li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">Analysis</strong>: Once the ESI has <a id="_idIndexMarker102" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/>been collected, it must be analyzed to determine its significance <a id="_idIndexMarker103" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/>and relevance to the legal request or investigation. This may involve reviewing the data to identify patterns or trends or using analytics tools to extract insights from <span>large datasets.</span></li><li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">Production</strong>: The relevant ESI<a id="_idIndexMarker104" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/> must be produced for the requesting party or authority. This may involve providing copies of data, producing reports or summaries of data, or testifying in court as an <span>expert witness.</span></li></ul></li>
<li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) guidance</strong>: The CSA provides a range of guidance documents related to cloud computing, including guidance on eDiscovery in cloud <a id="_idIndexMarker105" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/>environments. The CSA’s guidance is designed to help organizations manage the unique challenges of eDiscovery in the cloud, such as data privacy, security, and legal and <span>regulatory compliance:</span><ul class="calibre17"><li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">Data privacy</strong>: The CSA recommends that organizations implement strong data privacy controls to protect sensitive data during eDiscovery processes. This may involve using encryption to protect data at rest and in transit, implementing access controls to limit who can access data, or using data masking to obfuscate <span>sensitive information.</span></li><li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">Security</strong>: The CSA recommends that organizations implement appropriate controls to protect against breaches and incidents during eDiscovery processes. This may involve using security monitoring tools to detect and respond to threats, implementing multi-factor authentication to protect against unauthorized access, or using intrusion detection and prevention systems to detect and block <span>malicious activity.</span></li><li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">Legal and regulatory compliance</strong>: The CSA recommends that organizations ensure that they are complying with legal and regulatory requirements<a id="_idIndexMarker106" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/> related to eDiscovery. This may involve conducting regular risk assessments, implementing policies and procedures for eDiscovery, or engaging legal counsel to provide guidance on legal and <span>regulatory issues.</span></li></ul></li>
<li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (FRCP)</strong>: The FRCP is a set of rules that oversee civil proceedings<a id="_idIndexMarker107" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/> in US federal courts. These rules have been amended several times to address eDiscovery issues. For example, the rules require parties to implement appropriate procedures to preserve any relevant digital content that contains relevant information when litigation is expected. The rules also establish the scope of eDiscovery, which includes any supporting information, such as working papers, that could lead to the discovery of <span>admissible evidence.</span></li>
<li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">Sedona Conference</strong>: The Sedona Conference is a nonprofit legal research and educational organization that provides legal guidance on a range of issues, including eDiscovery. It<a id="_idIndexMarker108" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/> produces publications that cover a variety of eDiscovery principles, such as proportionality, data privacy, and the use of technology-assisted review, preservations, records management within eDiscovery processes, multi-jurisdictional eDiscovery, and cost and liabilities management because of eDiscovery. The Sedona Conference’s publications are often cited by courts in eDiscovery cases and are widely regarded as one of the authoritative sources of guidance on <span>eDiscovery issues.</span></li>
<li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">Electronic Discovery Reference Model (EDRM)</strong>: The EDRM is a framework that outlines the<a id="_idIndexMarker109" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/> stages of the eDiscovery process, from information management to production. The framework is designed to provide a common language and structure for eDiscovery activities, which can help parties to a legal matter understand and manage the eDiscovery process more effectively. The EDRM framework includes nine steps, including information management, identification, preservation, collection, processing, review, analysis, production, and presentation. Each stage is designed to build on the previous one, with the goal of producing accurate, complete, and defensible evidence that can be used in <span>legal proceedings.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="calibre3">In summary, irrespective of the choice of eDiscovery framework that investigators may follow, the underlying procedures for discovery, collection, preservation, and presentation of electronically stored information are generally similar. Legal courts around the world expect that ESI is collected in a forensically sound and legally <span>defensible manner.</span></p>

<h1 id="_idParaDest-28" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor032" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/>Digital forensics challenges</h1>
<p class="calibre3">The cloud has brought significant benefits to organizations, including increased flexibility, scalability, and cost savings. However, it has also introduced new challenges when it comes to eDiscovery and forensics. Outlined in the following list are some of the common challenges an investigator could encounter. Each cloud forensic case may present a unique challenge; however, these are some of the <span>common themes:</span></p>

<ul class="calibre12">
<li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">Data complexity and volume</strong>: The cloud provides organizations with virtually unlimited storage<a id="_idIndexMarker110" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/> capacity, which means that the amount of data that needs to be searched, collected, and analyzed during eDiscovery and forensic investigations can <span>be overwhelming.</span></li>
<li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">Data security</strong>: CSPs are responsible for securing the data stored in their systems, but organizations also have a responsibility to ensure that their data is protected during eDiscovery and forensic investigations. This can be particularly challenging in multi-tenant cloud environments, where data from multiple organizations is stored on the <span>same servers.</span></li>
<li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">Jurisdictional issues</strong>: Cloud data can be stored in multiple jurisdictions, which can make it difficult to determine which laws and regulations apply to eDiscovery and forensic investigations. This is particularly challenging when data is stored in countries with strict data protection laws, as organizations may need to navigate complex legal frameworks to access and process data. Forensic investigators would have to work through breach coaches (legal counsel) to obtain subpoenas to allow them to search and access data that may be hosted by CSPs in another jurisdiction. CSPs may also have policies and procedures in place, which may be a further hindrance in obtaining necessary information. This obviously requires multi-party cooperation (organization, investigator, CSP, breach coach) to allow access to the artifacts that are the subject of <span>the investigation.</span></li>
<li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">Lack of transparency</strong>: CSPs often use proprietary technologies and processes to manage their cloud infrastructure, which can make it difficult for organizations to understand how their data is being stored, accessed, and protected. This lack of transparency can make it challenging for organizations to conduct effective eDiscovery and <span>forensic investigations.</span></li>
<li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">Technical challenges</strong>: Conducting eDiscovery and forensic investigations in the cloud requires <a id="_idIndexMarker111" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/>specialized technical skills and tools. This includes the ability to collect and analyze data from a variety of sources in the cloud, including structured and unstructured datasets, as well as the ability to ensure that data is preserved in a forensically <span>sound manner.</span></li>
<li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">Data location and access</strong>: CSPs often spread data between various locations or zones (even if it is in the same country, data is spread between various volumes to ensure availability). This makes it difficult for investigators to locate and access relevant data. CSPs may also have their own access control that prevents or restricts <span>certain datasets.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="calibre3">In summary, DFIR teams are expected to encounter these challenges when dealing with a cloud investigation case. In the real world, this is often complicated by multi-jurisdictional legal requirements, eDiscovery requirements, and adhering to various legal requirements to<a id="_idIndexMarker112" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/> ensure the investigation is acceptable in a court of law. Nevertheless, it is important that you familiarize yourself with these challenges ahead of time and plan your investigations <span>around them.</span></p>

<div id="_idContainer013" class="calibre2">
<h1 id="_idParaDest-29" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor033" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/>Legal frameworks for private data</h1>
<p class="calibre3">In general terms, private <a id="_idIndexMarker113" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/>data is any data that is personal or sensitive in nature and is not intended for public dissemination. Examples include your name, date<a id="_idIndexMarker114" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/> of birth, address, and <strong class="bold">Social Security Number</strong> (<strong class="bold">SSN</strong>) as these are<a id="_idIndexMarker115" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/> typically classified as <strong class="bold">Personally Identifiable Information</strong> (<strong class="bold">PII</strong>), meaning these datasets can be used<a id="_idIndexMarker116" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/> to identify someone. <strong class="bold">Payment Card Information</strong> (<strong class="bold">PCI</strong>) is a group of confidential datasets that includes bank account, credit card number, card validation number, and the expiration month and year of the card. Finally, you have data such as medical records, diagnosis and assessment reports, X-ray reports, and psychological <a id="_idIndexMarker117" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/>assessment reports, which are referred to as <strong class="bold">Personal Health Information</strong> (<strong class="bold">PHI</strong>), which is sensitive <span>in nature.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">The sensitivity of the information also presents a challenge for incident responders and digital forensic investigators. Private data is often protected by laws and regulations governing data privacy and security (GDPR, CCPA, and so on), and therefore companies and incident responders are responsible for acting appropriately to safeguard private data and prevent unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. This also means that companies must address the necessary contractual obligations to ensure private data remains private. From a cloud forensics point of view, it is important for a forensic investigator to understand the nuances of various datasets that may be hosted in the cloud. Indicated in the next sections are some of the <span>legal considerations.</span></p>

<h2 id="_idParaDest-30" class="calibre10"><a id="_idTextAnchor034" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/>Contractual private data</h2>
<p class="calibre3">Any information that is<a id="_idIndexMarker118" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/> shared between parties in a <a id="_idIndexMarker119" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/>contractual agreement is considered confidential and not meant for public distribution. This type of data is typically protected by the terms of the contract itself, as well as applicable laws and regulations governing data privacy and security. Examples include trade secrets, financial information, personal information of employees or customers, and proprietary information about products or services. The parties to a contract<a id="_idIndexMarker120" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/> may be required to sign a <strong class="bold">non-disclosure agreement</strong> (<strong class="bold">NDA</strong>) or confidentiality clause that specifically outlines the types of information that are considered confidential and the obligations of the parties with respect to safeguarding <span>that information.</span></p>

<div id="sbo-rt-content" class="calibre1">
<div id="_idContainer013" class="calibre2">
<h2 id="_idParaDest-31" class="calibre10"><a id="_idTextAnchor035" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/>Regulated private data</h2>
<p class="calibre3">This refers to any<a id="_idIndexMarker121" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/> information that is regulated or protected under regulatory laws and compliance<a id="_idIndexMarker122" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/> requirements. For example, medical records, financial records, and PII. There are financial penalties and sanctions if companies fail to protect these regulated datasets. From an incident response standpoint, the following are some of the considerations the organizations should take <span>into account:</span></p>

<ul class="calibre12">
<li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">Regulatory compliance</strong>: Organizations that collect, process, or store regulated private data must follow regulations, such as HIPAA or GDPR. DFIR teams must be familiar with these regulations and ensure that their actions do not violate any <span>compliance requirements.</span></li>
<li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">Privacy laws</strong>: Privacy laws dictate how regulated private data should be collected, processed, and stored. DFIR teams must consider these privacy laws to ensure that their actions do not violate the privacy rights of individuals or <span>organizations involved.</span></li>
<li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">Data retention policies</strong>: Organizations that collect regulated private data often have specific data retention policies that dictate how long the data should be stored. This can typically range from 1 to 10 years. DFIR teams must take note of these policies to ensure that they do not destroy any data that should <span>be preserved.</span></li>
<li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">Chain of custody</strong>: DFIR teams must maintain a proper chain of custody for all data they collect during an investigation. This is especially crucial for regulated private data, as any mishandling or unauthorized disclosure can result in significant legal and financial consequences, including financial penalties for the company and <span>DFIR teams.</span></li>
<li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">Notification requirements</strong>: Many regulations require organizations to notify affected individuals or regulatory <a id="_idIndexMarker123" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/>authorities, including the Office of Privacy Commissioner (if applicable), in the event of a data breach within a specified time from the time the breach is discovered or identified. DFIR teams must be aware of these notification requirements and ensure they work with breach coaches to address notification requirements. Breach coaches will provide guidance on breach<a id="_idIndexMarker124" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/> notification requirements to the DFIR teams to prioritize certain investigative areas and be compliant with the <span>notification requirements.</span></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="_idParaDest-32" class="calibre10"><a id="_idTextAnchor036" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/>Jurisdictional requirements in relation to private data</h2>
<p class="calibre3">Private data could <a id="_idIndexMarker125" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/>be subject to specific legal requirements and protections in different jurisdictions, and it is critical to<a id="_idIndexMarker126" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/> comply with those requirements when handling incidents involving private data. This also includes notification requirements set out by these jurisdictions. For example, GDPR in the EU requires organizations to notify relevant authorities and individuals within 72 hours of a data breach that affects private data. CCPA requires businesses to notify affected parties/customers immediately upon personal information disclosure <span>or breach.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">When it comes to DFIR, these jurisdictional requirements can impact the collection, handling, and sharing of private data. For example, data may need to be collected and processed in a specific way to comply with local privacy laws. Similarly, the sharing of data with law enforcement agencies or other third parties may require legal approval or specific contractual agreements. It is critical for DFIR professionals to be familiar with the relevant jurisdictional requirements and to work closely with legal teams and breach coaches to ensure that all legal and regulatory requirements are met when handling incidents involving private data. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in significant legal and financial <a id="_idIndexMarker127" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/>consequences for the organization and potentially for individuals involved in <span>the investigation.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">The following regulations affect a lot of industries and organizations, and DFIR teams should be familiar with these depending on what type of data is investigated <span>and analyzed:</span></p>

<ul class="calibre12">
<li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)</strong>: Beyond GDPR and CCPA, in the US there are other privacy laws that exist, some at the federal level, such as HIPAA, which is designed to safeguard the privacy of an individual’s health information and enforces healthcare providers to ensure private and sensitive information is <a id="_idIndexMarker128" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/>protected while breaches <span>are reported.</span></li>
<li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA)</strong>: This law regulates the collection, use, and disclosure of<a id="_idIndexMarker129" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/> credit information by consumer reporting agencies, employers, and other entities. It also gives consumers the right to access and correct their <span>credit information.</span></li>
<li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)</strong>: This law protects the privacy of students’ educational <a id="_idIndexMarker130" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/>records and gives parents and students the right to access and correct <span>these records.</span></li>
<li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA)</strong>: This federal law regulates what personal information is collected, used, and disclosed<a id="_idIndexMarker131" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/> by financial institutions. It requires these institutions to safeguard this information and provide consumers with notice of their <span>privacy policies.</span></li>
<li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA)</strong>: This law regulates the interception of electronic <a id="_idIndexMarker132" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/>communications and sets out rules for obtaining and disclosing electronic communications stored by third-party <span>service providers.</span></li>
<li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)</strong>: This law outlines guidelines for online<a id="_idIndexMarker133" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/> service providers on the collection of personal information from children, specifically those under the age of 13. It requires online service providers to seek consent from their parents prior to collecting personal information <span>from children.</span></li>
<li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">Video Privacy Protection Act (VPPA)</strong>: This law regulates the collection, use, and <a id="_idIndexMarker134" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/>disclosure of personal video viewing information by video rental and streaming services. It requires these services to obtain consent before disclosing <span>this information.</span></li>
<li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">International Organization for Standardization/International Electrotechnical Commission (ISO/IEC) 27018</strong>: First published in 2014, ISO/IEC 27018 is a standard for providing guidelines for the protection of PII in public cloud <a id="_idIndexMarker135" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/>environments. DFIR teams should note that this is a standard and not a regulation to comply with. However, the standard provides a framework for implementing controls to protect PII and to help customers and regulators assess the level <a id="_idIndexMarker136" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/>of security implemented by a CSP. The guidance domains include <span>the following:</span><ul class="calibre17"><li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">Consent and notice for data processing</strong>: The standard requires CSPs to obtain consent from customers prior to collection, use, and disclosure of their personal information, and to provide notice about how their information will <span>be used.</span></li><li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">Transparency regarding sub-contractors</strong>: The standard requires CSPs to disclose the use of subcontractors that may have access to customers’ <span>personal information.</span></li><li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">Limitations on data use</strong>: The standard requires CSPs to limit the use of customers’ PII to that for which it was collected, and to obtain additional consent if the information is to be used for <span>other purposes.</span></li><li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">Security and confidentiality controls</strong>: The standard requires CSPs to implement security and confidentiality controls to protect customers’ personal information, such as encryption including data tokenization, access controls, and incident<a id="_idIndexMarker137" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/> <span>response procedures.</span></li><li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">Data retention and disposal</strong>: The standard outlines CSPs must establish policies and procedures for the retention and disposal of customers’ PII, and ensure that data is securely destroyed when it is no <span>longer needed.</span></li></ul></li>
<li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">Generally Accepted Privacy Principles (GAPP)</strong>: A framework developed by the <strong class="bold">American Institute of Certified Public Accountants</strong> (<strong class="bold">AICPA</strong>) and the <strong class="bold">Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants</strong> (<strong class="bold">CICA</strong>) to address privacy concerns. GAPP<a id="_idIndexMarker138" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/> is based on 10 fundamental privacy principles developed based on <strong class="bold">Fair Information Practices</strong> (<strong class="bold">FIP</strong>) for maintaining privacy. These include <span>the following:</span><ul class="calibre17"><li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">Management</strong>: An organization must assign information governance responsibility to an individual or team within the organization and implement appropriate policies and procedures complying with relevant <span>privacy laws.</span></li><li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">Notice</strong>: An organization must notify and detail what personal information is collected, used, retained, and disclosed <span>to individuals.</span></li><li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">Choice and consent</strong>: Individuals or customers are given the opportunity to opt out of sharing private data if they choose to do so. This includes opting-out choices on collection, usage, and disclosure of <span>personal information.</span></li><li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">Collection</strong>: An organization must clearly outline and collect data on specific personal information necessary for its <span>business purposes.</span></li><li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">Use, retention, and disposal</strong>: An organization must only use and retain personal information for its business purposes and dispose of it in a <span>secure manner.</span></li><li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">Access</strong>: An <a id="_idIndexMarker139" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/>organization must provide individuals/customers with access to their personal information allowing the option to change, update, or clarify <span>any inaccuracies.</span></li><li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">Disclosure to third parties</strong>: An organization must only disclose or share personal information with third parties after they have received an individual’s consent or as required <span>by law.</span></li><li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">Security for privacy</strong>: An organization must implement safeguards and ensure personal or private information is secured from unauthorized access, processing, disclosure, <span>or destruction.</span></li><li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">Quality</strong>: Like access, an organization must ensure personal or private information that is collected is correct and up <span>to date.</span></li><li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">Monitoring and enforcement</strong>: An organization must monitor and ensure compliance against the outlined principles and take appropriate action to address <span>any violations.</span></li></ul></li>
<li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</strong>: A privacy regulation in the EU that requires organizations to comply with how personal data is managed. GDPR applies to any organization, irrespective of location, that collects and processes the PII of <a id="_idIndexMarker140" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/>EU residents and citizens. GDPR outlines the key requirements for data controllers <span>and processors:</span><ul class="calibre17"><li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">Consent</strong>: Organizations must request permission from individuals prior to processing their personal <a id="_idIndexMarker141" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/>data, for example, they should use <strong class="bold">customer relationship management software</strong> (<strong class="bold">CRM</strong>) that has a consent management tool that documents the users consenting to the collection, storage, and processing of information of <span>its users.</span></li><li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">Transparency</strong>: Organizations must provide individuals with clear information on the purposes of the collection and processing of their <span>personal data.</span></li><li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">Data subject rights</strong>: Individuals have the right to access, manage the accuracy of, or remove their <span>personal data.</span></li><li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">Data minimization</strong>: Organizations must only collect and process personal data that is necessary for <span>their business.</span></li><li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">Security</strong>: Organizations must implement appropriate controls to ensure the security of <span>personal data.</span></li><li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">Accountability</strong>: Organizations must be able to demonstrate compliance with GDPR, including implementing appropriate data protection policies <span>and procedures.</span></li></ul></li>
</ul>
<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
<p class="callout">GDPR also includes strict requirements for data breach notification, with organizations required to report any breaches to the regulatory authority within 72 hours of becoming aware of the breach. Non-compliance with GDPR can result in significant fines and reputational damage, making it imperative for organizations to ensure that they are following <span>the regulation.</span></p>

<ul class="calibre12">
<li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA)</strong>: PIA provides detailed steps to allow organizations to review, address, and identify any privacy risks associated with a project. It provides a <a id="_idIndexMarker142" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/>comprehensive evaluation criterion to validate how personal information is collected, used, stored, and processed. The PIA process helps organizations to identify and mitigate privacy risks before they arise, as well as to <a id="_idIndexMarker143" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/>ensure that privacy considerations are integrated into the design and implementation of the project or initiative. This can help to build trust with stakeholders, including customers and employees, and to avoid legal and reputational risks associated with <span>privacy breaches.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
<p class="callout">In some jurisdictions, such as the EU under GDPR, PIAs may be mandatory for certain types of data processing activities, such as those involving sensitive personal data or the large-scale processing of <span>personal data.</span></p>

<ul class="calibre12">
<li class="calibre13">In Canada, some of the key privacy laws include <span>the following:</span><ul class="calibre17"><li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act</strong> (<strong class="bold">PIPEDA</strong>), which <a id="_idIndexMarker144" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/>provides the framework for the management and processing of personal information by businesses <span>and organizations.</span></li><li class="calibre13">For federal-government-led institutions, there is the <strong class="bold">Privacy Act</strong>, which defines the rules for the collection, use, and disclosure of <span>personal information.</span></li><li class="calibre13">The <strong class="bold">Canadian Anti-Spam Legislation</strong> (<strong class="bold">CASL</strong>) regulates <a id="_idIndexMarker145" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/>the sending of electronic messages (emails) and requires prior consent before sending <span>these messages.</span></li><li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act</strong> (<strong class="bold">FIPPA</strong>) is applicable to British<a id="_idIndexMarker146" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/> Columbia public organizations and sets out guidelines for the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information. It requires these organizations to protect personal information and to provide individuals with the ability to access their own <span>personal information.</span></li><li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">Personal Information Protection Act</strong> (<strong class="bold">PIPA</strong>), which is applicable only to businesses in the <a id="_idIndexMarker147" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/>province of<a id="_idIndexMarker148" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/> Alberta, Canada. This law requires organizations to obtain consent prior to the collection, usage, or disclosure of personal information during commercial activities in the province of <span>Alberta, Canada.</span></li><li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">Law 25 in Quebec, Canada</strong>, is a law that is aimed at modernizing legal requirements to protect personal information. Under Law 25, private sector organizations must obtain consent from individuals or customers when it comes to the collection, processing, or disclosing of their personal information. Law 25 also requires organizations to take steps to place guardrails to protect personal information and to report any data breaches. Quebec has its own privacy regulator, the <strong class="bold">Commission d’accès à l’information</strong> (<strong class="bold">CAI</strong>), which<a id="_idIndexMarker149" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/> oversees and enforces privacy laws in the province. DFIR teams should be aware of the role of the CAI in investigating and enforcing privacy breaches in the province of Quebec and should work closely with breach coaches to ensure compliance with <span>these laws.</span></li></ul></li>
</ul>
<p class="calibre3">In summary, it’s all about organizations obtaining consent prior to the collection and usage of information and clearly outlining the business purpose for such collection of personal information. Organizations are ultimately responsible for deploying appropriate controls to safeguard personal information. Similarly, for DFIR teams it is important to be aware of these privacy laws and jurisdictional requirements, as breach coaches will rely upon DFIR teams to provide appropriate recommendations based on applicable jurisdiction and <span>regulatory requirements.</span></p>

<h1 id="_idParaDest-33" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor037" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/>Legal implications for data retention and deletion</h1>
<p class="calibre3">Storing and retaining data, including in a multi-tenant cloud setup, can have significant legal implications for <a id="_idIndexMarker150" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/>organizations. These implications may vary depending on the type of data being stored, the jurisdiction in which the data is stored, and the applicable laws and regulations. Specifically, these include <span>the following:</span></p>

<ul class="calibre12">
<li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">Data retention requirements</strong>: Depending on the type of data and the jurisdiction in which it is stored, there may be legal requirements for organizations to retain data for a certain period. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in fines <span>and penalties.</span></li>
<li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">Data privacy laws</strong>: Data privacy laws, such as GDPR in the EU, place strict requirements on how personal data is collected, used, and disclosed. Organizations that store and retain personal data must comply with these laws, including implementing appropriate security measures to protect <span>the data.</span></li>
<li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">Data breach notification laws</strong>: Many jurisdictions have data breach notification laws that require organizations to notify affected individuals and regulatory authorities in the event of a data breach. Organizations that store and retain data must have appropriate breach notification policies and procedures in place to comply with <span>these laws.</span></li>
<li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">Intellectual property laws</strong>: Storing and retaining data, particularly in a cloud setup, may implicate intellectual property laws related to ownership and control of <span>the data.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="callout-heading">Property laws</p>
<p class="callout">Set of laws enforced to protect creations of human intellect such as inventions, literacy, artistic works, symbols, names, and images. These laws are designed to protect the inventors and encourage <span>creative freedom.</span></p>

<ul class="calibre12">
<li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">eDiscovery requirements</strong>: Organizations may be required to produce data in response to legal requests, such as during litigation or government investigations. Failure to retain data that may be relevant to these requests can result in <span>legal sanctions.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="calibre3">On the other hand, data<a id="_idIndexMarker151" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/> deletion has a very significant impact from a legal compliance standpoint and from a digital forensic standpoint, especially where legal and regulatory guidelines are enforced on data retention. In some jurisdictions, failure to comply with retention requirements can attract financial penalties as regulators will perceive this as mishandling data. From a forensic standpoint, if data is deleted that contains sensitive data or evidence of wrongdoing, there can be a significant reputational impact on the organization along with forensic <span>investigation impacts.</span></p>

<p class="calibre3">With the cloud, DIFR<a id="_idIndexMarker152" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/> has become a little more complicated. As such, it has significant implications for the assigning of liabilities and responsibilities for data <a id="_idIndexMarker153" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/>breaches and other security incidents. In cloud computing, there are several different parties involved, including the CSPs, the cloud customer, and any third-party providers that may be involved. Each of these parties may have different roles and therefore different levels of liability and responsibility exposures in the event of a <span>security incident.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">CSPs generally have a higher level of liability and responsibility for security incidents because they are responsible for the overall security and availability of the cloud infrastructure. This includes maintaining the physical security of the data centers, securing the network infrastructure, and implementing security controls to protect <span>customer data.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">Cloud customers have the responsibility for security incidents because they are responsible for configuring and securing their own applications and data within the cloud environment. This includes implementing appropriate access controls, encrypting sensitive data, and monitoring their own systems for security incidents. It is important for DFIR teams to <a id="_idIndexMarker154" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/>understand that threat actors will always attempt to exploit what is exposed to the internet. So, if a customer web application is internet-facing, threat actors will attempt<a id="_idIndexMarker155" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/> to exploit the vulnerabilities in the applications owned and hosted by the customer, rather than the underlying <span>cloud infrastructure.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">In terms of DFIR, the implications of liability and responsibility in cloud computing are significant. DFIR investigations may require access to data that is stored within the cloud environment, which can be challenging to obtain if the data is encrypted or if access controls are not properly configured. CSPs may also have their own incident response processes that need to be followed in the event of a security incident, which can impact the ability of DFIR teams to conduct investigations in a timely and <span>effective manner.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">Ultimately, liability and responsibility in cloud computing can significantly differ and can affect DFIR investigations. It is important for organizations to understand their own responsibilities and to work closely with CSPs to ensure that proper security controls are in place and that incident response processes are well defined <span>and understood.</span></p>

<h1 id="_idParaDest-35" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor039" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/>Jurisdiction and cross-border data transfers</h1>
<p class="calibre3">When data is transferred<a id="_idIndexMarker156" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/> across borders, it may be subject to different legal frameworks and regulations. This can include data privacy laws, data localization requirements, and government surveillance laws. For example, GDPR in the EU has strict requirements for cross-border data transfers, which can impact the ability of organizations to transfer data to CSPs located outside of <span>the EU.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">As incident responders, it is important to be aware of the legal implications of cross-border data transfers, especially when conducting DFIR investigations. Depending on the regional and global legal framework in place, access to data stored in the cloud may be restricted, or additional legal requirements may need to be met before data can <span>be accessed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">Therefore, as incident responders, it is important to stay informed about the legal framework in place and to<a id="_idIndexMarker157" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/> develop appropriate incident response plans that consider the unique challenges presented by cloud computing. By doing so, we can help ensure that investigations are conducted in a forensically sound manner and that the privacy and security of data <span>is protected.</span></p>

<h1 id="_idParaDest-36" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor040" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/>Summary</h1>
<p class="calibre3">This chapter provided various legal and privacy aspects for DFIR teams to consider prior to embarking upon a forensic investigation of a case where the cloud may be involved. A basic understanding of legal requirements will certainly help DFIR teams in making sure all the incident response sets adhere to legal and regulatory requirements. Some of the key learnings from this chapter include <span>the following:</span></p>

<ul class="calibre12">
<li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">It is all about jurisdiction</strong>: Where is the data located? Is it on a cloud system or a physical server? It is very important for DFIR teams to understand the location of the data being stored and whether there are any legal requirements to adhere to prior to collecting or transferring data <span>for investigations.</span></li>
<li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">Private data</strong>: It’s critically important for DFIR teams to recognize the type of data that is hosted on these affected systems. It could be PII, PHI, PCI, any other sensitive data, or all of them. However, it is important that they consider the legal requirements in each of the jurisdictions prior to collecting and analyzing the data. Keep in mind, DFIR teams are expected to ensure they clearly obtain consent from the organization prior to analyzing any sensitive information, and DFIR teams are expected to apply necessary security controls so that only authorized and qualified members of the team can analyze sensitive data. Once the analysis is completed, DFIR teams should make considerations to securely delete <span>the data.</span></li>
<li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">Various legal regulations</strong>: DFIR teams obviously face a tough challenge keeping up to date with various laws, legal frameworks, guidance notifications, and so on. It therefore becomes imperative that the legal counsel or breach coach becomes your best friend, specifically, to advise DFIR teams on various legal requirements, notification requirements, and consent prior to the collection, storage, and maintenance of such <span>sensitive data.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="calibre3">Through previous chapters, we learned about data being available in the cloud and elsewhere. Collecting and processing personal information poses a great responsibility for organizations and an even greater responsibility for DFIR teams to identify the root cause of any breaches that contain personal information. Given the various laws enforcing strong response and breach notifications, it becomes imperative that DFIR teams are well aware of how to investigate breaches, specifically if the data is being stored on <span>the cloud.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">In the next few chapters, we will focus on introducing the cloud for novices, and where logs can be found that can be crucial from an investigation point of view. We will also look at various CSPs and their relative capabilities to support DFIR teams in their <span>investigative journey.</span></p>
