It will enable you to gain a clear understanding of the role of digital forensics practitioners and their vital work in cybercrime and corporate environments, where they recover evidence of criminal offences and civil transgressions. Examples of real case studies of digital crime scenes will help you understand the complexity typical of many cases and the challenges digital evidence analysis poses to practitioners.</p><p>During the past 10 years or so, there has been a growing interest in digital forensics as part of tertiary courses and as a career path in law enforcement and corporate investigations. New technologies and forensic processes have developed to meet the growing number of cases relying on digital evidence. However, it has been apparent that the increasing complexity, size, and number of cases is creating problems for practitioners, who also face resource and costing restrictions and a shortage of well-trained and experienced personnel. The book will describe these challenges and offer some solutions, which hopefully will assist and empower current and prospective practitioners to manage problems more effectively in the future.</p><p>These are truly exciting and challenging times for practitioners seeking to enhance their skills and experience in recovering evidence and assisting the legal fraternity in making sense of their important findings. For those wishing to enter the discipline, they do so at a time when banality, complacency, and fatigue are disappointingly quite common. The enthusiasm of entering the profession can rapidly dissipate because of tedium and heavy caseloads, notwithstanding the inherently exciting and important nature of the work. Presented in this book are new and more effective ways to reduce tedium and time wastage, reinvigorate practitioners, and restore the excitement of the hunt for evidence heralded by fresh winds of change.</p><div class="section" title="What this book covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>
<a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. The Role of Digital Forensics and Its Environment">Chapter 1</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>The Role of Digital Forensics and Its Environment</em></span>, describes the digital forensics environment—an emerging discipline within the broader field of forensic science. It outlines the main digital forensics environments of criminal and civil law cases and describes the role of digital forensics practitioners.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Hardware and Software Environments">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Hardware and Software Environments</em></span>, presents the basic working of computer hardware, operating systems, and application software and describes the nature of recovered digital evidence. A basic introduction to filesystems and files commonly recovered during forensics examination is given as well as an insight into file encryption and password protection.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. The Nature and Special Properties of Digital Evidence">Chapter 3</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>The Nature and Special Properties of Digital Evidence</em></span>, describes the special characteristics of digital evidence, including the nature of files, file metadata, and timestamps, which form an essential part in the reconstruction of suspected offences. The complex nature of digital evidence is introduced, and the expectations of the courts as to its admissibility in legal hearings is explained.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Recovering and Preserving Digital Evidence">Chapter 4</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Recovering and Preserving Digital Evidence</em></span>, explains the importance of preserving digital evidence in accordance with legal conventions. It describes forensic recovery processes and tools used to acquire digital evidence without undue contamination under different forensic conditions.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. The Need for Enhanced Forensic Tools">Chapter 5</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>The Need for Enhanced Forensic Tools</em></span>, emphasizes the redundancy of conventional forensic imaging and the indexing of increasingly larger datasets and introduces new forensic processes and tools to assist in sounder evidence recovery and better use of resources. The chapter introduces the disruptive technology now challenging established digital forensic responses and the overreliance on forensic specialists, who are themselves becoming swamped with heavier caseloads and larger, more disparate datasets.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Selecting and Analyzing Digital Evidence">Chapter 6</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Selecting and Analyzing Digital Evidence</em></span>, introduces the structure of digital forensic examinations of digital information through the iterative and interactive stages of selecting and analyzing digital evidence that may be used in legal proceedings. The chapter introduces the stages of digital evidence selection and analysis in line with acceptable forensic standards.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. Windows and Other Operating Systems as Sources of Evidence">Chapter 7</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Windows and Other Operating Systems as Sources of Evidence</em></span>, provides you with an understanding of the complexity and nature of information processed on computers that assist forensic examinations. The chapter looks at the structure of typical Windows, Apple, and other operating systems to facilitate the recreation of key events relating to the presence of recovered digital evidence. It touches on malware attacks and the problems encountered with anti-forensics tactics used by transgressors.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch08.html" title="Chapter 8. Examining Browsers, E-mails, Messaging Systems, and Mobile Phones">Chapter 8</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Examining Browsers, E-mails, Messaging Systems, and Mobile Phones</em></span>, looks at Internet browsers, e-mail and messaging systems, mobile phone and other handheld devices, and the processes of locating and recovering digital evidence relating to records of personal communications such as e-mails, browsing records, and mobile phones. The value of extracting and examining communications between persons of interest stored on computer and mobile phones is described.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch09.html" title="Chapter 9. Validating the Evidence">Chapter 9</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Validating the Evidence</em></span>, emphasizes the importance of validating digital evidence to ensure that as thorough as possible an examination of the evidence is undertaken to test its authenticity, relevance, and reliability. Some common pitfalls that diminish the admissibility of digital evidence, as well as the evidentiary weight or value of evidence, are discussed, as is the need for open-minded and unbiased testing and checking of evidence to be a routine matter. The presentation of digital evidence and the role of the forensic expert is outlined in the chapter.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch10.html" title="Chapter 10. Empowering Practitioners and Other Stakeholders">Chapter 10</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Empowering Practitioners and Other Stakeholders</em></span>, provides a summary of the book and reflects on the changes presently occurring within the discipline. It offers some new processes and tools that enhance the work of practitioners and reduce the time spent on each case as well as untangling the complexity of analyzing large datasets.</p></div></div>
