    Forensics. We covered these tools as we are involved in their development and
    we also have lengthy experience using them. However, the market for mobile forensic
    tools is not limited to the small bunch of products reviewed in this book. There
    are more well-known and truly excellent tools available.

    an extensive range of tools for mobile forensics under their **Universal Forensic

    UFED Logical Analyzer, UFED Phone Detective, and more are available from Cellebrite.

    This includes the ability to acquire a number of devices (such as those equipped
    with Qualcomm chipsets, a number of Lumia smartphones, and so on) via a company-developed
    bootloader exploit ([http://blog.cellebrite.com/blog/tag/android-forensics/](http://blog.cellebrite.com/blog/tag/android-forensics/)).
    This acquisition method is clean, robust, and forensically sound. In certain cases,
    UFED can be the only acquisition tool that can do the job.

    a range of high-quality mobile forensic tools under the XRY umbrella. This includes
    XRY Physical, XRY Logical, XRY PinPoint, and XRY Viewer. XRY allows performing
    physical and logical extraction from a wide range of mobile devices, extracting
    all available raw data (physical only). XRY Logical allows recovering most of
    the live and filesystem data from the device and is the automated equivalent of
    manually examining each available screen on the device.

    to exploit unique properties of certain chipsets and OEMs that allow investigators
    to dump the entire contents of the device while bypassing bootloader lock and
    screen lock altogether. Oxygen Forensic Suite has been thoroughly reviewed in

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It depends on what's available. If all you have is a working but locked iPhone,
    and the passcode is not known, the only chance of extracting anything off the
    phone is to attempt physical acquisition. If the phone falls within the compatibility
    matrix, you can follow these steps to extract information out of the device. With
    its characteristic-guaranteed timeframe, physical acquisition is the only way
    to obtain information out of a locked device.

    to perform a selective download of essential information, such as call logs, geolocation
    information, address book, messages, and so on from iCloud. Selective downloading

    download information right away, without knowing the user's passcode, Apple ID,
    and account password.

    With recovery key deposit and obligatory recovery procedures for corporate online

    data without the end user's knowledge. However, Apple has modified its security
    policies. Apple automatically sends an e-mail notification to the user's registered
    Apple ID when someone attempts to download their iCloud backup. A notification
    is delivered to a registered e-mail address when accessing iCloud backups from
    a new IP address. However, the notification is not sent when accessing application
    data such as **Keynotes**, **Pages**, or **Numbers** documents. These notifications
    are designed to prevent spying on unsuspecting users, notifying the user that
    their data is being downloaded.
