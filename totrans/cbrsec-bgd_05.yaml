    related to cybersecurity and cyber attacks have also burgeoned, with organizations
    having to pay more to keep their infrastructure secure. McAfee, a leading cybersecurity
    company, reported that the cost of cybercrime in 2017 was $600 billion. Individual
    attacks were estimated to have cost $5 million in the same year with $2.75 million
    having been lost to downtime and productivity loss. The cost of securing organizations
    was estimated to be $81 billion in 2016\. Since the cost of cybersecurity solutions
    has also increased, the total cost of securing organizations has also been going
    up. Therefore, the world economy is losing a lot of money to cybercrime. This
    money could have been put to more productive use, but it is either ending up in
    the hands of cybercriminals or being spent on cybersecurity solutions.

    their time to first study their targets. They do observations of how the system
    they are targeting operates, how secure it is, the humans that use it, and the
    times that it is active. Once they have done reconnaissance, they scan the system
    and identify its technical specifications, as well as the vulnerabilities it may
    be having. Only when sure of the vulnerabilities, will the hackers try to breach
    the system to steal data and money, or to compromise it. These stages can be replicated
    on other targets, such as networks or users. It is evident that each stage takes
    time, and this is why hackers have to be patient. If they attack without knowing
    the security systems in place, the attack could flop and the organization could
    be triggered to secure the system even more. In addition to this, hackers are
    also patient when learning how to hack. Veteran hackers have studied programming
    languages in order to be able to read code or reverse engineer programs to find
    out where vulnerabilities exist. To become such an expert that you can analyze
    code written in different languages, one definitely has to spend a lot of time
    learning how to code. Hackers invest their time in this to prepare for their cybercrime
    activities.

    always have an upper hand. Many old hacking techniques and tools will not work
    today due to the sophistication of cybersecurity tools. Systems that could have
    been exploited a few years ago through vulnerabilities such as SQL injection,
    have also been patched and are fully secure. However, hacking is still on the
    rise, which means that hackers are constantly coming up with new techniques and
    tools that cybersecurity companies are not aware of. They are also actively searching
    for new vulnerabilities to exploit. This just shows how determined hackers are.
    Hackers have also been targeting large corporations that are expected to have
    state-of-the-art security. However, this is not enough to stop the hackers, as
    previous incidences have shown. For instance, Facebook, with a user base of 2
    billion people, was hacked in 2018 and data belonging to 50 million users stolen.
    To many people, it could be assumed that Facebook has so many security features
    that it would just be time wastage to try and hack it. However, hackers have proven
    just how determined they are to bring down any target they aim at.

    bars if caught. However, hacking is still going on. Some of the cybercriminals
    are known by their pseudo names and will often leave their signatures wherever
    they have hacked. A good example is a hacker known as Higinio Ochoa who was caught
    in 2012 by the FBI after leaving a clumsy message after his hack. As was the norm
    after every attack, Ochoa left a signature via a message taped on his girlfriend's
    stomach and uploaded it on Twitter. However, Ochoa had forgotten to remove meta
    information from the image that the FBI used to track and arrest him. Ochoa had
    stolen data from the FBI, yet had the guts to try and taunt the agency, which
    is known for tracking down all types of criminals with a high success rate. This
    incidence shows how risk-taking hackers are. They are not afraid of breaking laws
    and informing law enforcement officers that they are the ones responsible.

    into handing sensitive details, or even transferring money to hackers. With the
    increasing cybersecurity budgets for organizations to buy more effective tools
    and security services, the channels for attacking systems and networks directly
    are reducing. However, hackers are exploiting other avenues to hack into highly
    secured organizations, and they are doing this through social engineering. There
    have been multiple hacks where it has been reported that the hackers simply coerced
    users into sending them money or giving them passwords. An increasingly common
    technique is business email compromise, where hackers are spoofing emails of executive
    employees and instructing junior employees to send money or passwords to certain
    accounts or emails. The use of coercion is working so effectively because hackers
    are exploiting flaws in the communication channels used by organizations. It has
    become normal for executives to order around junior employees and even to break
    protocol. Therefore, if the junior employees are asked by a spoofed email to send
    money to an overseas account, they will yield, simply because that is what the
    real executive does. Hackers have perfected their coercion skills as well, to
    a point that it is hard for the targets to say no. Hackers will refine the stories
    they will tell the users they target before sending them. If it is a call they
    are making, they will know what to say, depending on how the targets respond.
    Some social engineers even make physical appearances before targets to gain their
    trust. Therefore, coercion is simply one of the many essential tricks that hackers
    possess. They are coercive.

    ever arrested or convicted. Cybercrime networks are hardly ever broken. All this
    is because cybercriminals employ a lot of caution in their malicious activities.
    From the planning phase of an attack, cybercriminals will start exercising caution,
    and use communication tools and techniques that make it hard for the messages
    to be traceable. Encryption, self-destructing emails, spoofed emails, and dark
    web communication tools are commonly used. During an attack, hackers will also
    cover their trails. They will use IP addresses from VPNs or proxies routed through
    other VPNs and proxies. The flow of data will be such that it is hard to trace
    where hackers came from and where stolen data was routed to. Additionally, hackers
    will operate systematically, where each of them knows what to do and when. Funds
    stolen directly from targets are not directly cashed into the hacker's banks since
    this would make it easy for them to be tracked. Instead, ghost accounts opened
    in overseas banks that do not have as many restrictions are used. Alternatively,
    money obtained from cybercrime passes through money laundering schemes till it
    cannot be traced back to the cybercrime incident. With the advent of cryptocurrencies
    that come with privacy controls aimed at anonymizing transacting parties, it is
    even easier for hackers to cleanse their money by converting it to cryptocurrencies
    and then withdrawing it or buying assets using the cryptocurrencies and liquidating
    them later on.

    a small number of them that get caught in unfortunate circumstances. For instance,
    the FBI has been said to list its own fake malware on such sites only to arrest
    those that buy the malware. In response to this, both buyers and sellers in the
    market become extra-cautious when transacting. Even when a hacker is arrested,
    it is hard for the enforcement agencies to arrest another because they do not
    operate using real names, and will quickly cut off communication if they are suspicious.
    At the moment, cybercrime is operating as an underground economy that is thriving,
    and the appropriate steps have been taken by players in the economy to protect
    its existence. Therefore, cybercriminals will keep on acting with a great deal
    of caution to protect themselves and others. Hacking networks are hard to break,
    due to the high levels of secrecy employed by hackers. For instance, it is known
    that there are dark web sites where one can purchase highly effective malware.
    However, not just anyone can buy. Most of these markets use invitation-only systems
    and, even then, none of the hackers in the market dare to divulge any information
    that could be used to bust any of the hackers.

    their bank accounts and withdrawing all the money found. No society expects its
    own to do such things. Cybercriminals also defy laws. They will engage in fraud,
    theft, destruction of resources, and identity theft, among other crimes. In any
    case, cybercriminals are not typical people. They are hardened to steal without
    mercy and break rules without fearing any consequences. Therefore, hackers will
    tend to be divergent from the norm, and will be ready to engage in malicious acts
    despite knowing that it is wrong to do so.

    be less drawn towards engaging in cybercrime as they would fear being arrested
    and leaving the dependents without a breadwinner. The lack of social skills also
    presents another problem, where the hackers will be soulless and thus merciless
    in their attacks. They do not view the other side of the target, such as the people
    that depend on the organization they are trying to attack. They will do these

    complex, and thus compensate for this by hurting others or damaging assets. An
    inferiority complex is where an individual lacks self-esteem, doubts their own
    capabilities, and feels that they do not measure up to some standards. Such a
    person will feel weak and, thus, to compensate for this, they will try and do
    something to prove that they are strong. Some hackers have these social characteristics,
    and this makes them very dangerous. If the hacker feels that the world sees him
    or her as a weakling, he will be ready to prove that he is not by hacking. Sometimes
    this feeling gets to employees in organizations and they eventually become insider
    threats. For instance, an employee kept under constant pressure and highly criticized
    by their boss for never delivering, or not being good enough, could be pushed
    to the edge and decide to strike back to prove that they are strong. Hackers that
    suffer from inferiority complexes are prone to carrying out cyber attacks that
    can cause heavy damage, as they will be trying to show others just how powerful
    they are. Such hackers are also not worried about the consequences of their actions,
    as their main objective is to send a message to those that had shown them disrespect
    or looked down on their abilities.

    and will do anything to overhaul what they do not like. For instance, hacktivists
    could stand up against the arrest of an influential journalist due to the existence
    of laws that limit the freedom of expression. They could be ready to force such
    laws to be done away with by unleashing waves of attacks against government agencies
    and top government officials. Cyber terrorists borrow from the ideals of the terrorist
    groups they are affiliated with, and mostly these ideals are from radical views.
    For instance, cyber terrorists from a group such as Al Qaeda could be against
    the interference of Westerners in local wars and could end up destroying infrastructure
    in the Western countries to promote the message that they are not wanted and must
    leave. Other cybercriminals will have their own radical views that they will base
    their actions on. Radicalism helps the cybercriminals escape the guilt of the
    negative impacts of what they do. For instance, if cyber terrorism leads to the
    destruction of a nuclear energy plant, and, consequently, to the deaths of the
    workers in such a plant, the perpetrators will be shielded from the guilt of killing
    innocent people by their radical beliefs.

    is, therefore, an extension of this rebellion, except that the crime is conducted
    via a computer network or computing device. Cybercriminals take bold stands against
    the law and tend to gang up when they do so. They can form organized hacking groups
    or cyber-crime support structures. These groups, or structures, bring like-minded
    people together, and they can be highly effective, since all the members already
    disregard laws, morality, and ethics. They also possess tools, techniques, and
    skills that they can use against the people, bodies, or agencies they are rebelling
    against. Rebellion has many causes, but the main cause in the case of skilled
    people turning to hacktivism and cybercrime is economic need. To some extent,
    there exists an imbalance in the society, where wealth lies with a small percentage
    of people. Some people rebel, with the hope that their rebellion will lead to
    the redistribution of the wealth held by only a few. In other cases, people turn
    to cybercrime as a rebellion as a result of deprivation and oppression. There
    are countries where citizens live under oppressive governments, and the only way
    to fight such governments is to rebel. People might decide to join others that
    have rebelled, and contribute in fights against oppression, by hacking people
    in the oppressive governments and destroying some crucial infrastructure that
    benefits such governments. For instance, hackers may engage in hacking activities
    that will lead to the economic sabotage of the country, thus forcing the oppressive
    government to step down. Therefore, sometimes hackers are created by extreme circumstances
    that require them to rebel, with the hopes of making a difference. However, the
    means of achieving the change they hope to see ends up blurring the lines between
    the good they want to achieve and the bad they have to do to achieve it.

    anger or depression at other people by hacking them. At such low points, hackers
    will lack any remorse for their targets. If they rob the elderly of all the money
    saved, they will not feel a thing. If the hackers destroy infrastructure worth
    billions of dollars, they will still not feel a thing. Therefore, the lack of

    incidences have shown this. Business Insider claimed in 2015 that hackers, relatively,

    customers interacting with the seller, who, in this case, is a hacker. Hackers
    do not have to directly engage in hacking to make money as there are many other
    ways of making a sustainable income in such a business. To begin with, they can
    make and sell exploits to other hackers. Some exploit kits are rented, where other
    hackers can use them for a given period as agreed during renting. Some hackers
    own botnets. Botnets are networks made up of many computers that have been infected
    with malware that can be used to force them to participate in attacks. Botnets
    are used in DDoS attacks, where they send more traffic than a target can handle,
    causing it to cease handling all legitimate requests. Since the advent of the
    IoT, many of these small devices that are connected to the internet were found
    to be lacking basic security features. They have thus been continually infected
    with malware which makes them botnets, and some of them have been used in attacks
    against renowned targets. A hacker who owns such malware gets many requests from
    other hackers to rent them the tool for a given duration, and the tool is paid

    already making money and will not be willing to stop doing so because of their

    to sustain their sources of income. Greed also motivates them to keep looking
    for vulnerabilities to exploit in systems. A hacker knows that a new vulnerability,
    unknown to others, could easily translate to millions, and so they are ready to
    undertake scanning across several systems used by different organizations just
    to find one that has vulnerabilities. Greed is also a motivator in phishing, where
    a hacker goes to make clones of authoritative companies, write phishing emails
    laid out exactly like those of authoritative companies, or  use spoof email addresses
    of executives in organizations to be used for hacking. The hacker is greedy for

    get resources from high-ranking politicians. In the case of state-sponsored hacking
    groups, the attackers are conditioned to behave like an army and will take orders
    to attack from those high in command. Hackers that have this type of thinking
    are not mainly motivated by greed or money. They are motivated by an illusion
    of patriotism to their own countries.

    of hackers that want to push for a certain societal or political change. Hacktivists
    will generally attack governments or specific organizations. When hacktivists
    are against the government, their operations are indeed political and the hackers
    will work towards having their voices heard.

    another country. This does not, however, discount the fact that an external entity
    already had the contact details of the family members of US military officers
    and proceeded to send threatening messages to them. Religious extremism is a motivator
    to hacking, and terrorist groups have been radicalizing those that join the groups
    to attack certain people or countries using any means they can. Religious extremist
    groups have been making news due to their technological advancements and presence
    in the cyberspace. Groups such as ISIS have promoted their ideals and recruited
    new members through the internet. Secret communications have been held by leaders
    of these terrorist groups on the dark web. Finally, terrorist groups have been
    moving towards hacking. While foot soldiers in terrorist groups make physical
    attacks to promote their radical interpretations of their own religion, terrorists
    now have other teams to carry out cyber attacks. This could stem from the fact
    that some groups, such as ISIS, opened their gates for everyone to join saying
    that there was an opportunity for anyone to support the group's ideals. In 2017,
    pro-ISIS hackers hacked 800 school websites. When visitors tried loading these
    pages, they would be redirected to videos containing ISIS propaganda. Investigations
    revealed that these school websites were developed by a company called SchoolDesk,
    which had probably been attacked, and updates pushed to the codes of the school
    website to redirect users to the ISIS propaganda video. In May 2018, alleged ISIS
    hackers started sending text messages to wives of US military personnel which
    contained threats to their lives and those of their children.

- en: There are intelligent people who occasionally want to try and see what some
    codes do. They end up inadvertently hacking into organizations, even though that
    was not their motive. For instance, computer science students might be taught
    about SQL injection. A curious student might want to try out what they learned.
    While many of the current websites have been built with security considerations
    in place to prevent such attacks, old websites that are not maintained, might
    not be so protected. Therefore, the student could try to hack an old website and
    end up compromising it using an SQL injection statement. Such hackers could be
    innocent, but they can still cause damage. Even more dangerous is the possibility
    of curiosity leading to one becoming a cybercriminal after finding out that it
    is possible to break into poorly secured web-based systems.

- en: From the discussions above, hacking can be better understood by looking at it
    from a psychological perspective. The traits of hackers, as presented, show that
    maintaining healthy social lives can help reduce cybercrime. People that lack
    social lives or like to lead isolated lives could be checked up on to make sure
    that they do not fall into cybercrime. It has been said that hackers are both
    patient and determined. These two traits have far-reaching implications for cybersecurity
    approaches in organizations. Since hackers will not relent easily, and will also
    take their time to find a vulnerability in the organization, it is prudent for
    organizations to adopt cyber resilience rather than cyber defense. Unlike cyber
    defense, cyber resilience ensures that an organization is protected from attackers,
    and, in the event that an attack happens, business processes will not be adversely
    affected. It has also been discussed that hackers are coercive. This, therefore,
    means that employees can easily fall prey. Organizations must, consequently, invest
    in programs to train their employees on how to protect themselves from hackers.
    Alongside this, organizations must set up clear procedures on how credentials
    can be shared, and also how a transfer of funds can be authorized. Hackers have
    been said to be careful in their attacks and this affects how organizations should monitor
    their systems and networks. Minor observations of abnormal activities on networks
    should not be ignored as hackers might be making a move. Additionally, organizations
    should invest in intrusion prevention systems to prevent some activities, such
    as network scanning, that might be used by attackers. Based on how attackers think,
    it can be learned that the main motivator for them is money, thus all resources
    that they can steal and make money from should be highly secured. Organizations
    that store personal data should employ extra security measures, such as encrypting
    their databases. Additionally, since some hacking events are politically motivated,
    governments in other countries have to take the initiative to follow up with the
    attackers and seek diplomatic resolutions.

- en: The chapter has focused on what drives hackers and has discussed their psychological
    make-up and thought patterns. In the psychological make-up section, we have looked
    at the traits which define most hackers. These traits include patience, determination,
    insensitivity, risk-taking, coercion, carefulness, defiance, lack of social skills,
    radicalism, and rebellion, among others. Most of these traits help profile attackers
    and can be used to prepare an organization for hacking incidences. The patience
    and determination show just how far a hacker is willing to go. Insensitivity rules
    out appeals for mercy as a countermeasure to hacking events. The risk-taking trait
    shows that the hackers are not afraid of the law catching up with them, as it
    hardly ever does. Coercion and carefulness show how meticulous hackers are in
    their attacks and can get the best of targets, even before they can suspect they
    are being attacked. These traits also show that it may be hard to try and recover
    what has been stolen after an attack and thus more attention should be paid to
    protecting an organization from the attack in the first place. Radicalism and
    rebellion also add to the understanding of hackers as people who are not so remorseful
    and have an internal motivation to carry out their attacks. The chapter then looked
    at how hackers think and showed that their motivators are financial gain, greed,
    politics, religious extremism, and curiosity. Lastly, the chapter has looked at
    what can be learned from the psychology of the hackers covered.
