- en: Windows Phone is a newcomer in the mobile market. Microsoft is playing aggressively,
    selling large numbers of low-cost devices through many wireless carriers. The
    operating system is optimized to run perfectly even on low-end hardware and it
    offers a much smoother user experience on cheap phones, compared to the bulkier
    and heavier Android.

    Windows Phone accounts for some 2.6% market share (Q2 2015). 8.8 million units
    were sold in Q2 of 2015.

    manages to grow its user base by selling millions of inexpensive devices in emerging
    markets, such as India. Windows Phone is a strong third after Google Android and
    Apple iOS, while BlackBerry barely makes it into the **Others** chart.

    Microsoft has full control over the platform (Qualcomm) that is used by the different
    manufacturers of Windows Phone devices, so unlike Android there can be no sub-standard
    implementations here. As a result, all Windows Phone devices are roughly equivalent
    in terms of security. Until very recently, JTAG and chipoff acquisitions were
    the only methods to acquire most Windows Phones. However, in January 2015, Cellebrite
    implemented an acquisition module enabling investigators to perform physical acquisition
    of a lot of Lumia devices. The technology is still at an early stage. There's
    still a lot to do in parsing the contents. However, the filesystem is NTFS, and
    the OS is very similar to Windows, so eventually, this will be done.

    developed a bootloader unlock method for Lumia 520, 521, 525, 620, 625, 720, 820,
    920, 925, 928, 1020, and 1320\. Devices with unlocked bootloaders can be used
    to boot unsigned code which, in turn, can be used for the purpose of physical
    acquisition.

    can be successfully acquired via the process of JTAG forensics. The process is

    the data partition. According to the official **Windows Phone 8.1 Security Overview**
    document (which can be downloaded from [https://download.microsoft.com/download/B/9/A/B9A00269-28D5-4ACA-9E8E-E2E722B35A7D/Windows-Phone-8-1-Security-Overview.pdf](https://download.microsoft.com/download/B/9/A/B9A00269-28D5-4ACA-9E8E-E2E722B35A7D/Windows-Phone-8-1-Security-Overview.pdf)),
    internal storage can only be encrypted via a corporate security policy by implementing
    the **Require Device Encryption** policy. When activated, the policy prevents
    users from disabling device encryption and forces encryption of internal storage.
    No escrow keys are created or uploaded to anywhere on the network to allow decrypting
    the encrypted partition. When enabled, Windows Phone 8.1 devices are encrypted
    with BitLocker technology using **Advanced Encryption Standard** (**AES**) 128-bit
    encryption.

    must be decrypted prior to acquisition. In order to decrypt the device, the correct
    PIN code must be entered to unlock the device; however, Windows 10 Mobile makes
    encryption possible even without a PIN code. In Windows 10 Mobile, there is no
    user-configurable provision to wipe device memory after n unsuccessful login attempts;
    therefore, hardware-based PIN recovery options are possible for such devices.
