The chapter explains the importance of preserving digital evidence in line with legal expectations. It describes the forensic processes and tools used to acquire digital evidence without undue contamination. The topics covered in this chapter are as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The concept of the chain of custody in relation to the preservation of evidence from its collection up to its tendering in legal proceedings</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The acquisition and safe custody of digital devices and data</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The recovery of digital evidence through forensic imaging processes, also known as<a id="id258" class="indexterm"/> <span class="strong"><strong>dead recovery</strong></span></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The acquisition of digital evidence<a id="id259" class="indexterm"/> through <span class="strong"><strong>live recovery</strong></span> processes</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The efficacy of existing forensic tools and the emergence of enhanced tools</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Case studies that highlight the processes and pitfalls of recovering and preserving digital evidence recovered from a crime scene</li></ul></div><p>A digital forensic examination requires a systematic, formalized, and legal compliance approach to enhance the admissibility of the evidence, the need for which was introduced and emphasized in <a class="link" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. The Nature and Special Properties of Digital Evidence">Chapter 3</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>The Nature and Special Properties of Digital Evidence</em></span>. It is always important to assume that any forensic examination will be critically scrutinized. Courts need to satisfy themselves as to the reliability of the evidence and the integrity of the forensic processes and tools used to procure, secure, and analyze the evidence throughout the entire forensic process.</p><p>The digital crime scene is integrated with the physical crime scene in that the digital evidence is located in a physical artifact, notably, some form of computing device such as a desktop computer, a mobile phone, or a digital storage medium, including flash drives and external storage drives. A physical crime scene observes the laws of a physical nature, which dictate the appropriate recovery of physical evidence, whereas the analysis of stored digital data is used to find digital evidence.</p><p>Courts will generally accept that a chain of responsible and legitimate custody of an exhibit acts as an assurance of the integrity of evidence unless proven to be otherwise. Any break in the history<a id="id260" class="indexterm"/> of what is commonly referred to as the chain of custody potentially degrades the<a id="id261" class="indexterm"/> admissibility of digital evidence as well as its evidentiary value. It is the maintenance of the integrity of the evidence from seizure until the time the practitioner or custodian of the exhibit produces it in court.</p><p>The next section describes the chain of custody and its importance in preserving evidence exhibits that will later be used in legal proceedings, criminal as well as civil.</p><div class="section" title="Understanding the chain of custody"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl1sec33"/>Understanding the chain of custody</h1></div></div></div><p>Whenever possible, great care<a id="id262" class="indexterm"/> must be taken when collecting and taking lawful possession of any physical objects that may potentially be used as evidence in legal cases. There are a number of important reasons why collected evidence must be safeguarded from contamination. Preventing any intentional or unintentional tampering of the evidence is paramount. If the evidence is not maintained in pristine condition, some inconvenient and probing challenge from the opposing legal team may well be anticipated.</p><p>If the evidence is seen to be tainted in some way, then its admissibility is questionable. Not unreasonably, it should, as a matter of course, be challenged because it is possibly unreliable and its authenticity is in serious doubt. In criminal cases, where there is doubt about evidence, the jury would clearly be placed in a difficult position trying to unravel the truth and determine the reliability of a questionable exhibit. In such circumstances, the judge may well direct that the benefit of the doubt be given to the defendant. The value of the exhibit is therefore diminished and the judge may have it struck out as being inadmissible. This is highlighted in the case studies later in this chapter.</p><p>Assurances that sound protection processes and adherence to court conventions and standards have been observed must be demonstrated to the court. Courts expect that reasonable steps are taken to ensure exhibits were protected at all times. It is critical to observe the rules of collection and the chain of custody of the evidence by ensuring that the recovered evidence was not contaminated. This includes ensuring that the evidence was not altered between its acquisition and its presentation in legal proceedings and even before its acquisition by the practitioner. If it was altered for some reason, then this must be disclosed to the court and other parties to the trial; some explanation and justification should also be provided.</p><p>The rules of collection for a<a id="id263" class="indexterm"/> typical digital forensic recovery include the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Some assertion that the devices and evidence acquired were done so under lawful authority.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">A complete record describing the computer devices and peripheral equipment such as modems, monitors, and printers and their location in the premises where the devices were seized or accessed—a sketch map is essential.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Photographic and video recordings of the previous two points.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The handling of each seized exhibit using antistatic and sterile gloves and tagged with a firmly affixed label that describes the exhibit and may be cross-referenced to the evidence register.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Noting the powered state of each device and recording whether the devices were powered down and the nature of access if a live recovery was attempted.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">A description<a id="id264" class="indexterm"/> of the forensics tools used, including hardware and software write blockers used, the model or version of each device or piece of software that was used, and confirmation that the tools were tested and up to date.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">A record of the personnel who seized and handled the devices and a complete record of access to each device and the evidence storage device from the point of seizure to court presentation.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">A report of any alteration to the evidence recovered and an explanation and justification of such alteration. For example, during the recovery of data from mobile phones, it is normal to switch on the device and install a small executable file to allow extraction. In theory, this might cause a loss of data from the phone but it is an unavoidable process and self-justifying, provided the practitioner can explain this if required to do so.</li></ul></div><p>The complete history of the custody of the exhibit must be fully documented to account for its location and custodianship between seizure and presentation. This includes confirmation of its safe custody until the expiration of possible appeal periods. The court must also be satisfied that there is a complete record of any test and examination of the exhibit, in particular, whether the exhibit was altered in any way, such as in the case of sample tissue removed for toxicology and other analysis. The court also requires some proof that the exhibit was protected from physical damage while being transported from the crime scene to the place of safekeeping and laboratories.</p><p>Obviously, the case can collapse if it can be shown or there is some suspicion that there has been a break in the chain of custody. On occasion, the judge may direct that the evidence is inadmissible, but alternatively may also permit the jury to make a decision on its admissibility while considering its evidentiary value. Therefore, it is important to show that the chain of custody is unbroken; otherwise, the court may disallow it if it were to be challenged by the opposing legal team. The completeness and accuracy of the evidence logging of the chain of custody enhances the court's willingness to accept assurances as to the<a id="id265" class="indexterm"/> authenticity of digital evidence. Consequently, it is crucial that the chain of custody adhere to approved legal standards.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Describing the physical acquisition and safekeeping of digital evidence"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl1sec34"/>Describing the physical acquisition and safekeeping of digital evidence</h1></div></div></div><p>The process of handling<a id="id266" class="indexterm"/> digital evidence is especially vulnerable to errors. Just like blood samples or fingerprints, which may easily be contaminated at the<a id="id267" class="indexterm"/> crime scene, digital evidence may also be damaged during collection and extraction unless strict procedures are followed. The storage and safekeeping of physical records, such as witness statements, crime scene photographs, facsimiles of manuscripts, and so forth, require prudent record-keeping and safe custody, thus facilitating their production as evidence. It must be reiterated that the courts expect that digital evidence can be shown to be unaltered or contaminated from its point of seizure to the time it is tendered in legal proceedings.</p><p>This is no different from crime scene preservation, which requires preservation of the evidence in pristine condition. In traditional crime scenes, it is not uncommon for the scene to be disturbed by those who make discovery of it. Disturbance by extreme weather conditions, such as fire, heat, wind, rain, and water, as well as animals, insects, and bacteria can also alter the state of the evidence. This leaves the forensics examiner with the challenge of trying to preserve the remains and other exhibits, such as a corpse or the murder weapon, from further deterioration. Consequently, it makes reconstructing the events of the crime difficult.</p><p>So it is with a digital crime scene, which must also be protected from contamination and further interference. It is common that information stored on a computer suggesting some form of offense or impropriety is discovered by an organization's personnel, such as a supervisor of administrator. Their well-intentioned efforts to preview and collect what they consider to be vital evidence may in effect contaminate and render such evidence inadmissible at worse and altered so as to diminish the weight of the evidence at best. Without some sound forensic training in evidence recovery and initial management of suspected transgressions, this will remain a problem to practitioners left with the task of reconstructing the chain of key events.</p><p>You can refer to just such an occurrence mentioned in the case study in <a class="link" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. The Nature and Special Properties of Digital Evidence">Chapter 3</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>The Nature and Special Properties of Digital Evidence</em></span>.</p><div class="section" title="Explaining the chain of custody of digital evidence"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec65"/>Explaining the chain of custody of digital evidence</h2></div></div></div><p>The recovery of digital <a id="id268" class="indexterm"/>evidence is often a complicated process requiring great care to ensure that evidence is not inadvertently<a id="id269" class="indexterm"/> contaminated, destroyed, or lost (refer to the case studies at the end of this chapter). Common pitfalls are often encountered during the recovery and preservation stage, and it is easy for an overzealous and inexperienced examiner to alter the evidence unintentionally when examining the crime scene or back in the forensic laboratory. Recall from <a class="link" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. The Nature and Special Properties of Digital Evidence">Chapter 3</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>The Nature and Special Properties of Digital Evidence</em></span>, how easy it is to alter digital metadata. For example, the last accessed timestamp may be inadvertently deleted or overwritten by an inept practitioner or custodian of the computer prior to or at its point of seizure.</p><p>Simply seizing an exhibit and locking it in a secure container until it is required in court will not suffice. A formal record cataloging the history of the exhibit is required. The courts expect exactly the same assurances that apply to other forms of evidence as to the safe care of digital evidence throughout its possession. Documented careful handling of the evidence by practitioners enables courts to reconstruct the events surrounding the creation of digital evidence as well as what occurred on a computer system in the past. This will substantially enhance confidence in the genuineness of the evidence.</p><p>The chain of custody is important. Each exhibit acquired and every forensic image made of the data recovered from the devices must be recorded in detail. When taking possession of an exhibit, a record of the acquisition must be recorded. This should include a full description of the exhibit, case reference, the custodian details, and signatures of all parties involved, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/4931_04_01.jpg" alt="Explaining the chain of custody of digital evidence"/><div class="caption"><p>An acquisition of evidence exhibit</p></div></div><p>When the <a id="id270" class="indexterm"/>custodianship is passed to another party, such <a id="id271" class="indexterm"/>as the forensic examiner or an external examiner, or is released back to the original owner, the transfer details must be recorded in the chain of custody register. An example of such a form is shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/4931_04_02.jpg" alt="Explaining the chain of custody of digital evidence"/><div class="caption"><p>The transfer of an evidence exhibit to another party</p></div></div></div><div class="section" title="Outlining the seizure and initial inspection of digital devices"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec66"/>Outlining the seizure and initial inspection of digital devices</h2></div></div></div><p>In conventional crime scene examinations, each item of physical evidence is a single and often independent component of the case. The inadmissibility of a physical exhibit may not seriously<a id="id272" class="indexterm"/> weaken the strength of the case and the prosecution may well succeed without it. In contrast, a digital evidence artifact is often highly interconnected <a id="id273" class="indexterm"/>with other evidence and, if it is deemed inadmissible, may occasionally be more damaging to the case. It is so important when reconstructing a timeline of key events to support any hypothesis or counter-argument as to the nature of a transgression that, wherever possible, the practitioner should try to corroborate each evidence object against other information or at least show some correlation between two events. If there is any indication that the evidence has been tampered with before, during, or even after the recovery process, this may alter data and metadata such as relevant timestamps, which would diminish its value. Consequently, the practitioner needs to preserve the integrity of evidence contained in seized devices.</p><p>When making a forensic image of a device, it has been traditionally necessary to remove the hard drive from the device, which, if it is not immediately returned to the device, should be removed with great care to avoid physical damage to the drive. The use of sterile antistatic gloves <a id="id274" class="indexterm"/>should be used to avoid creating a short circuit to the drive, which might make it inoperable. The drive and the drive to which the image is being copied should be tagged<a id="id275" class="indexterm"/> and placed in an anti-static exhibit bag recording the date and time of the imaging process, the case identifying details, the details of the parent computer and drive serial number, make and model, and the name of the person filling out the tag.</p><p>The record of this exhibit identification process is duplicated and cross-referenced in the chain of custody register. This should record the date, time, and location of the acquisition and the forensic process and tools used in the recovery of digital information. We will now look at samples of evidence collection forms, starting with the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/4931_04_03.jpg" alt="Outlining the seizure and initial inspection of digital devices"/><div class="caption"><p>A sample evidence collection form</p></div></div><p>The following screenshot shows an example of a sketch plan to show the connectivity of devices and their<a id="id276" class="indexterm"/> location at the crime scene:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/4931_04_04.jpg" alt="Outlining the seizure and initial inspection of digital devices"/><div class="caption"><p>A sample evidence collection form</p></div></div><p>The following <a id="id277" class="indexterm"/>screenshot shows the details of the seized exhibits:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/4931_04_05.jpg" alt="Outlining the seizure and initial inspection of digital devices"/><div class="caption"><p>A sample chain of custody form</p></div></div><p>The following <a id="id278" class="indexterm"/>screenshot shows an example of the exhibit tracking<a id="id279" class="indexterm"/> form and final disposal certificate:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/4931_04_06.jpg" alt="Outlining the seizure and initial inspection of digital devices"/><div class="caption"><p>A sample chain of custody form</p></div></div><p>Attached to the<a id="id280" class="indexterm"/> collection form should be a further exhibit: the imaging log<a id="id281" class="indexterm"/> report that confirms the identity of the device imaged, the date and time of the imaging, the name of the practitioner, and a hash of the device. A sample taken of an imaging log from a self-authenticating <code class="literal">.ASB</code> file (an IXImager digital forensic evidence container described later in this chapter) is shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/4931_04_07.jpg" alt="Outlining the seizure and initial inspection of digital devices"/><div class="caption"><p>An extract from a .ASB forensic image log</p></div></div><p>There is a legal expectation<a id="id282" class="indexterm"/> that the custodian of the exhibit be able to demonstrate some documentary proof <a id="id283" class="indexterm"/>of an unbroken chain of custody from the creation of the record to the tendering of the exhibit in court. Obviously, practitioners should handle the computer holding the potential evidence as little as possible to ensure that an authenticated copy of the data preserved in a forensic image or container is not altered. If it has been altered, the practitioner must be able to account for and describe any alterations that occurred.</p><p>The recovery and preservation phases of digital evidence acquisition attempt to stabilize the digital crime scene, thereby preventing, or at least minimizing, the loss or alteration of data being extracted. It will require isolating the system from any cable and active Wi-Fi network connections. Ideally, the means to recover potentially important volatile data such as RAM, which would be lost when the system is turned off, should be considered by practitioners beforehand.</p><p>Standard <a id="id284" class="indexterm"/>procedure is to take photographs and record video footage of the crime scene, including the computer monitor and any image that is displayed on the <a id="id285" class="indexterm"/>screen. Taking notes associated with each exhibit, such as its position at the crime scene, any cabling connected, and its powered state, should be a routine procedure.</p><p>When removing hard drives or opening a device, antistatic forensic gloves should be worn, or at least an antistatic band worn on the practitioner's wrist and be earthed appropriately. This will minimize any damage by static electric discharge to the circuitry of sensitive electronic equipment that may render it inoperable.</p><p>The practitioner should also consider identifying any suspicious processes running on live devices. Furthermore, the use of telecommunication equipment and Bluetooth transmitters, such as those embedded in mobile phones and tablets, may interfere with the devices being seized. If practicable, these telecommunication devices, and any equipment that emits strong magnetic waves, should be disconnected. The use of portable Faraday cages to transport and examine mobile phones should be considered if it is necessary to prevent nearby external telecommunications interfering with the devices.</p><p>The transportation of the physical artifacts to a suitable location for later examination may typically involve the physical transfer of seized computer devices to a safe location. Less commonly, it may involve network transmission of data. It is important to ensure that during transportation, the evidence is protected from physical harm or electronic interference. Exhibits also need to be protected from heat, moisture, dust, and physical shocks. Some form of protective packing is desirable, as well as an identity tag to clearly describe the artifact to avoid it becoming misplaced or misidentified. Isolating the device, especially if it has some form of telephony or Wi-Fi connectivity, is essential, and this certainly needs to be considered in the event that the device, such as a mobile phone, is switched on when accessing stored data on the device.</p><p>The collected evidence will, in most cases, need to be stored securely because examination cannot usually take place immediately. Care should be taken to identify and tag physical evidence such as a computer, which will often link stored digital evidence through the device to a potential suspect. The digital crime scene may be considered a secondary crime scene to the physical crime scene. Recall <span class="emphasis"><em>Locard's exchange principle</em></span> too: it may be necessary to take samples of DNA and fingerprints to determine who had access to the keyboard and device.</p><p>If the forensic examination leads to a court case, the practitioner needs to explain how and why forensic tools and processes were used. The practitioner must be prepared to vouch for and be able to verify the integrity of all these aspects of examination if called upon to do so. This would include describing the collection processes and confirming that the collection process caused no contamination, and that the evidence remained uncontaminated after it was collected and during its examination.</p><p>The practitioner may sometimes be called upon to verify that the evidence was unaltered in any way by later <a id="id286" class="indexterm"/>comparing the forensic image made with the state on the original computer. This<a id="id287" class="indexterm"/> is usually achieved by comparing the hash signature of the device and the image, which should be identical. This process is discussed in more detail in the subsection called <span class="emphasis"><em>The reliability of forensic imaging tools to recover and protect digital evidence</em></span> later in this chapter. The opposing legal team and the court can insist that the digital evidence presented be able to be confirmed by independent analysis.</p><p>Digital information suspected of containing evidence is normally preserved by storing it on another computer, external storage device, or DVDs. Before this copying process is undertaken, sound forensic processes must be adhered to that require strict compliance with the chain of custody. Forensic imaging is part of the chain of custody and is presented in the following section.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Recovering digital evidence through forensic imaging processes"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl1sec35"/>Recovering digital evidence through forensic imaging processes</h1></div></div></div><p>The practitioner takes possession of the physical exhibits that contain digital evidence, which are kept in secure<a id="id288" class="indexterm"/> storage in exactly the same way as other exhibits. As discussed in <a class="link" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. The Nature and Special Properties of Digital Evidence">Chapter 3</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>The Nature and Special Properties of Digital Evidence</em></span>, the courts recognize the increased risk of evidence<a id="id289" class="indexterm"/> tampering and authentication problems with digital evidence. Tampering of digital evidence is relatively easy and has, in the past, created great uncertainty about its soundness. The use<a id="id290" class="indexterm"/> of reliable forensic tools minimizes the risk of evidence contamination during formal recovery of digital data. Regrettably, the immature status of digital forensics as a scientific discipline continues to cause disagreement over defining helpful and broadly accepted standards and processes.</p><p>A practitioner has the option of undertaking a dead recovery or a live recovery of data from a computer believed to hold evidence of value. However, the practitioner will need to examine the data and has several options to do so. It has been the usual and preferred practice to make a forensic image of the drive or drives contained inside the device. This form of recovery is often referred to as a dead analysis and allows the imaging of drives without activating the operating system. This is intended to avoid evidence contamination and copying errors. Poor practices at this stage may put the admissibility of the evidence at risk if contamination occurs.</p><div class="section" title="Dead analysis evidence recovery"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec67"/>Dead analysis evidence recovery</h2></div></div></div><p>A <span class="strong"><strong>dead recovery</strong></span> occurs when data from a computer is being forensically copied without using the computer's <a id="id291" class="indexterm"/>operating system. The term "dead" refers to the state of the operating system and uses the computer's hardware booted from a trusted CD or external device or copies data from an extracted hard drive using a hardware write blocker.</p><p>Dead analysis recovery may be achieved by powering down the device and either removing the drive and making a duplicate copy of the drive by imaging it separately or by powering on the device to copy the drive in situ. A dead recovery occurs after the system has been shut down and then trusted forensic applications and hardware tools recover the data. For some time now, it has become progressively impractical to seize anything more than actual computer terminals. In both cases, the drive is not fully booted, and in the latter case, the device is accessed by a CD or USB thumb drive, which prevents the operating system from being mounted but allows the practitioner to view and select the file partitions for imaging.</p></div><div class="section" title="Write-blocking hardware"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec68"/>Write-blocking hardware</h2></div></div></div><p>In effect, dead recovery ensures that all operating system processes are terminated by turning the system off in the event that the device is active at the point of seizure. Write-blocker hardware <a id="id292" class="indexterm"/>and software is normally used to prevent evidence from being overwritten. Dead recovery ensures that later analysis of the forensic image may be undertaken using reliable forensic hardware and software in a trusted operating environment to find evidence. This process continues after data has been imaged to ensure that the image is not altered in any way, because it is essential to preserve the data for future analysis.</p><p>One benefit of making forensic images is that they can be copied and the duplicates used as backup copies, handed to other examiners for analysis, or handed to the other legal team for independent evidence inspection. However, logic would dictate that it is only necessary to collect data that is needed. Here, I part company from the die-hards in the discipline preoccupied with the need to make a forensic image of "anything that moves". The discipline has created some bad habits, and indiscriminately imaging entire hard drives is one of them.</p><p>It is entirely possible that data may be written to the device containing evidence unintentionally during the forensic recovery and examination stages. Naturally, such an eventuality may lead to the inadmissibility of the digital evidence during legal proceedings. It requires the practitioner to take measures to avoid contamination of the evidence.</p><p>Normal computer operation involves writing data to or reading data stored on the device by specific commands and transmitting these commands to the storage device, such as a hard drive, thereby contaminating the device from a forensic perspective. An effective way to avoid such contamination is using write-blocker software or hardware to allow data recovery from a device without writing to it.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note07"/>Note</h3><p>The use of a<a id="id293" class="indexterm"/> write blocker prevents the sourced computer from writing to its hard drive's interface and onto the hard drive, which would otherwise overwrite or contaminate the data.</p></div></div><p>Here is an image of a hardware write blocker that may be used to access a SATA drive:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/4931_04_08.jpg" alt="Write-blocking hardware"/><div class="caption"><p>The Tableau write blocker</p></div></div><p>The following image shows a laptop connected to a SATA hard drive through a hardware write blocker:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/4931_04_09.jpg" alt="Write-blocking hardware"/><div class="caption"><p>A laptop connected to a SATA hard drive through a hardware write blocker</p></div></div><p>With live recovery, where the device is not powered down, there is a high risk of recovering false and<a id="id294" class="indexterm"/> incomplete evidence because the operating and application software may be untrustworthy or may conceal or falsify data. However, cutting off the power supply too quickly may lead to information being cleared from memory. Moreover, by powering down abruptly, there is a possibility that it may not be possible to power the device back on. Damage to the device hardware may eventuate as well as an inevitable loss of some running services and filesystems. For desktop and laptop computers, which will maintain some log activity of these processes and some information on the hard drive in RAM slack, swap, and page files, they may be partially recoverable.</p><p>There is a range of disk editing programs, including Norton Diskedit, that can read and recover the contents of RAM, which may hold login passwords. More recently, RAM contents are required for malware analysis to more easily locate encrypted or obfuscated malware, which has been decrypted in RAM and is normally difficult to decrypt and analyze otherwise. However, these capture processes require the system to be operating and the programs to be installed prior to shutdown, which may itself contaminate data. When recovering data from networked systems that store large datasets, shutting down the system before collecting volatile data may result in some evidence loss.</p><p>The overriding need for the preservation of the operating system files and all other stored data must be considered prior to the recovery process, which may alter the source device. Preservation processes must <a id="id295" class="indexterm"/>be incorporated with data recovery processes to minimize, and ideally prevent, contamination and preserve the data in pristine condition. Dead recovery may be inappropriate on an organization's network as it may result in a loss of functionality for an extended time. This may occur if the network is not mirrored or duplicated for deployment to avoid a disruption to normal business.</p></div><div class="section" title="Write-blocking software"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec69"/>Write-blocking software</h2></div></div></div><p>Using write-blocking software offers advantages of using hardware write blockers that require the removal <a id="id296" class="indexterm"/>of hard drives, as described in the following process.</p><p>During the process of booting and then suspending the computer with the hard drive still in situ, the imager USB dongle (or CD) is inserted and the <span class="emphasis"><em>F12</em></span> key pressed to allow booting to take place from the USB dongle (or CD).

Forensic images may be mounted through such forensic tools as ILookIX. While this does not amount to a live recovery, the operating system and applications can be used as if a live analysis were taking place, and it may be of supplementary value to the practitioner and often a shortcut to identifying the location and contents of application logs and other files relevant to an investigation. As the forensic image is a copy and in non-writable mode, evidence contamination is avoided as the original data remains on the sourced device.</p></div><div class="section" title="Enhancing data preservation during recovery"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec70"/>Enhancing data preservation during recovery</h2></div></div></div><p>It is standard forensic <a id="id302" class="indexterm"/>practice to ensure that forensic tools are calibrated to meet the manufacturers' specifications and that any firmware updates are installed. This will reduce the likelihood of errors and inaccuracies occurring in the recovery process, such as during forensic imaging of devices. It is also important to calibrate digital storage devices such as external hard drives used to store forensic images and other media. These devices should be zeroed, hashed, and checked to ensure there are no bad sectors or errors that may affect the imaging process and the composition of the image. Failure to configure the destination device may result in residual data from previous events or from the manufacturing process remaining on the device mixing with the recovered data to cause contamination.</p><p>Effective preservation <a id="id303" class="indexterm"/>processes are typically recorded by acquisition logs and hashes that permit the attribution of events and data to the users of the device and prohibit future claims that they were manipulated by the practitioner imaging a device. The promptness with which data is forensically acquired minimizes the effect of future claims of deliberate or accidental contamination.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note08"/>Note</h3><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Hashing</strong></span> comprises<a id="id304" class="indexterm"/> taking an input of any length of data, performing complex mathematical calculations, and creating a fixed-length string that is unique.</p><p>The modification of the input data produces an altered output that is detectable by comparison of the two inputs.

Hashing is a time-consuming process and really only of value in forensic imaging, which in itself may eventually become obsolete—perhaps an outrageous prediction in the mind of less forward-thinking observers. The declining importance of forensic imaging is discussed in the <span class="emphasis"><em>Outlining the efficacy of existing forensic tools and the emergence of enhanced processes and tools</em></span> section, which discusses emerging technologies that herald a paradigm shift in the way digital evidence is garnered.</p></div><div class="section" title="Recovering remnants of deleted memory"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec71"/>Recovering remnants of deleted memory</h2></div></div></div><p>While dead recovery <a id="id305" class="indexterm"/>may deny the practitioner access to volatile memory, remnants of it are often left in what is termed file slack, which may facilitate some memory recovery. This is a phenomenon of Windows operating systems, which dictate the length of each file saved on a hard drive. Because most files vary in size and a percentage of clusters in each allocated cluster or file space is not occupied by the file, the sector is filled with clusters called <span class="strong"><strong>RAM slack</strong></span>. The computer may pack this free space with a random series of<a id="id306" class="indexterm"/> data from the computer memory, which may be recoverable and provide some useful evidence from recent and old RAM events. In the event that more drive sectors are needed during file storage, drive slack is used and is padded with remnants of deleted data. Both drive and RAM slack may hold remnants of memory, providing logon names and passwords as well as other potentially <a id="id307" class="indexterm"/>useful information. Recovering this may include advanced data carving during analysis of the forensic image. Live recovery may be able to more easily recover volatile memory, and this is discussed in the following section.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Acquiring digital evidence through live recovery processes"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl1sec36"/>Acquiring digital evidence through live recovery processes</h1></div></div></div><p>The process of recovering <a id="id308" class="indexterm"/>digital evidence by extracting live system data before powering down a computer involves<a id="id309" class="indexterm"/> capturing and at the same time preserving volatile memory, system processes, and network information that would otherwise not be recoverable with the traditional dead recovery process. Live recovery occurs when the computer operating system is still running. Until recently, it has been widespread practice to undertake dead recovery, with the recommendation that computers should be turned off to prevent accidental deletion and contamination of evidence.</p><p>The comparatively small size of datasets made it feasible but still time-consuming to image hard drives as a matter of convention. There was also the belief that the courts expected the best evidence to be produced and accepted that forensic images of hard drives were acceptable and certainly assisted the recovery and analysis of evidence while safeguarding the data.</p><p>Practitioners felt that there was a risk in using live recovery because the very examination could lead to data being overwritten and erased. Furthermore, there were well-justified concerns that the operating system and software applications may have been modified to delete vital information or produce false readings and information during the recovery process.</p><p>In exceptional circumstances, practitioners have found it expedient to access original data through the live recovery process. To undertake live recovery, practitioners must be competent to do so and to give evidence explaining the relevance, justification, and implications of their actions. A full report of all the processes used in the recovery must be recorded and made available for examination if later required.</p><div class="section" title="The benefits of live recovery"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec72"/>The benefits of live recovery</h2></div></div></div><p>One of the objectives<a id="id310" class="indexterm"/> of live recovery is the preservation and collection of the computer's volatile data to the best extent possible, preserving the state of the computer operating system and data. It is not uncommon for practitioners to undertake some form of triage, especially during an incident-response scenario, where it is important to determine whether a significant event occurred. This approach has the<a id="id311" class="indexterm"/> benefit of securing a sound data collection for a full forensic analysis if justified as a result of a triage. This seems to be quite common practice in mobile phone recovery using field kits.</p><p>Live recovery does not create a bit-for-bit image of the target drive, but it takes a snapshot of the targeted part of the system, which is not always reproducible later as the target drive may have been in subsequent use and earlier data may have been modified. While courts have questioned the admissibility of evidence acquired during live recovery because of concerns over some loss of data during the recovery process, this is now becoming less of an issue. However, this is provided the practitioner is able to explain the recovery process involved and assure the court that any small data loss would not adversely affect the remaining evidence presented. This concern is described in more detail in <a class="link" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. The Need for Enhanced Forensic Tools">Chapter 5</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>The Need for Enhanced Forensic Tools</em></span>.</p></div><div class="section" title="The challenges of live recovery"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec73"/>The challenges of live recovery</h2></div></div></div><p>Practitioners are still reluctant to use live recovery, not considering it to be a sound and straightforward forensic process. However, others consider the process will only have minor effects on the<a id="id312" class="indexterm"/> operating system and data. If undertaken, the practitioner should be able to predict the effects of the recovery on the system and data and explain and justify the process. Interestingly, much case law supports the preference to use whichever method best preserves all the data on computer media.</p><p>To reiterate, it is normal practice for practitioners to take forensically sound images of all bytes of data contained within each media device, thereby facilitating the identification of further evidence. To date, practitioners prefer dead recovery to capture and preserve digital evidence for fear of modifying it, and have shut down computers to do so. As pointed out previously, there is a concern that by closing down a device, there will be a loss of some metadata. Timestamps, for example, may be altered, thereby frustrating and confusing later event reconstruction. Moreover, it may not be possible to access the hard drive if it has been password protected and encrypted. RAM data will also be lost.</p><p>An emerging problem for practitioners examining local and computer networks is determining the authenticity and reliability of digital evidence because of the use of anti-forensic toolkits. These toolkits can obfuscate the reconstruction of events and may well obstruct recovery from live network sources. Slurred images can also occur as a result of the live recovery of a filesystem modified by a running program, thereby modifying and altering the metadata during acquisition, affecting correlation with file data.</p><p>In extreme cases, anti-forensic tactics may booby-trap a device so that when it is booted up, a previously installed program deletes or alters the data held on the device. Other anti-forensic ruses, such as the Metasploit Project, target and prevent forensic tools from recovering evidence. In other instances, explosives have been wired to computers in the hope that while powering it up, the investigators will be killed by the explosion.</p><p>The loss or tainting of digital evidence during its handling by practitioners is commonplace and<a id="id313" class="indexterm"/> potentially affects its admissibility. This has forced courts, notably those in the USA, to consider one of two existing standards: the court may pass a judgment on incomplete or missing evidence, or the court operates under the "good faith of the prosecution". However, some commentators believe that these practices could condemn a potentially innocent person or allow a guilty defendant to walk free. Until now, reliable forensic tools to undertake live recovery were not available. These are presented in <a class="link" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. The Need for Enhanced Forensic Tools">Chapter 5</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>The Need for Enhanced Forensic Tools</em></span>, relating to the emergence of enhanced forensic tools.</p></div><div class="section" title="The benefits of volatile memory recovery"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec74"/>The benefits of volatile memory recovery</h2></div></div></div><p>One of the advantages <a id="id314" class="indexterm"/>of live recovery is the ability to recover volatile and non-volatile data. Volatile data, such as that stored in RAM, is information that may be lost if power to the machine is disconnected, which would not be available if using dead recovery.</p><p>However, and most helpfully, IXImager can reboot fast enough to enable capture of the system's RAM, effectively allowing the capture of running programs, passwords, and so on. This may be undertaken by inserting a forensic USB drive, CD, or even an SD card into the computer, rebooting the computer and commencing the imaging process, and imaging the RAM captured in the device folder. It would be prudent, though, to determine which function key (often <span class="emphasis"><em>F12</em></span>) needs to be pressed on the respective device to prevent the normal startup process and ensure that the imaging process is successful.</p><p>Live recovery also facilitates the recovery of non-volatile data. The recovery of volatile data may assist in reconstructing a timeline of events to determine the identity of the suspect, the possible motive for a transgression, and other useful records of events. The type of volatile data that may be of value would include:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The system date and time</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Current network connections</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Open <span class="strong"><strong>Transmission Control Protocol</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>TCP</strong></span>) and <span class="strong"><strong>User Datagram Protocol</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>UDP</strong></span>) ports and the <a id="id315" class="indexterm"/>executables that are <a id="id316" class="indexterm"/>opening these ports</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Users currently logged on</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The internal routing table</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Running processes</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Scheduled jobs</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Open files</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Process memory dumps</li></ul></div><p>Live recovery can help correlate information between the computer being examined and other network-linked<a id="id317" class="indexterm"/> computers. Volatile data can be located and saved during live recovery. The order of volatility ranges from memory RAM, which is erased rapidly, through to raw disk blocks that are more persistent and will normally remain on a drive after it is switched off. The range of volatility, from most volatile to least volatile, is as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Memory</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Swap file</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Network processes</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">System processes</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Filesystem</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Information</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Raw disk blocks</li></ul></div></div><div class="section" title="Isolating the device from external exploits"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec75"/>Isolating the device from external exploits</h2></div></div></div><p>The threat from external <a id="id318" class="indexterm"/>sources to the integrity of data held in a computer is an ever-present problem. This is especially so when attempting a live recovery of evidence. It is prudent to isolate the device from unpredictable data on the device. Data located on a system that may have been booby-trapped to prevent forensic examination will most likely contain executable files that may, for example, delete all files on the device.</p><p>It may also be programmed to communicate with a remote system and warn others of the live recovery taking place. There may also be unintentional consequences of opening files, such as an HTML file, causing the installed browser to execute scripts and download files from a remote site. Isolation from the external environment is important to prevent any tampering from occurring to the suspect system by hostile parties. This will also prevent unintentional transmissions being sent out that may compromise a forensic examination.</p><p>When undertaking a live recovery, the practitioner needs to identify and suspend any suspect processes that may contaminate data. If there is a network connection that should be physically unplugged or the device may be connected to an empty hub, then care should be taken to <a id="id319" class="indexterm"/>prevent a log message about the network disconnection being sent to any external parties connected to the device. The risk of remote access to the device has to be prevented, and this may be achieved by applying network filters, thereby preventing any remote access.</p><p>The possibility always exists that a remote attacker can be linked to the computer server being examined during a live recovery. Moreover, it is possible that a brute-force attack may be taking place from the server and directed against other networked computers. It is standard practice to check a computer's network connections for active connections and identify legitimate ports from those that may indicate a hacker attack. For the inexperienced practitioner facing this form of recovery, they will often be confronted with a significant number of unidentified open ports, which may be legitimate or can be exploited as a backdoor attack. Therefore, it would be prudent to determine what executables are present on the computer that may exploit these open ports.</p><p>Live recovery recognizes the value of preserving volatile data that may be lost, but it may result in some effect on the system and data. Many feel this is an acceptable tradeoff given the value of the data that can be collected from a running system with minimal impact to other evidence. Some practitioners have commented that changing the evidence admissibility regimen to demonstrate that live recovery has not or cannot materially modify or introduce new information will empower practitioners to undertake more efficacious examinations. This may facilitate more digital evidence to be tendered in court proceedings. If one file is critical to prove a case, it must show that it has not been altered from its original state, as the process of evidence identification and file recovery becomes less of an issue.</p><p>Another argument often proposed by practitioners claims that live recovery should be a last resort until the use of the process is endorsed by case law and court rulings. Perhaps, rather than awaiting a response from the courts to make a change, practitioners should move the debate in a new direction. This may require some sound experience and training to undertake live recovery so as to be able to present and explain the processes involved to the court. In effect, many practitioners are already undertaking live recovery using new forensic tools designed for that purpose—tools that have adapted to the inefficiency of forensic imaging in the light of large and dispersed datasets.</p><p>Until recently, the discipline seemed preoccupied with heavy caseloads, large datasets, and tools that seemed to fall short of delivering sounder outcomes for practitioners to meet these new demands. The next section discusses the limitations of existing tools and processes.</p></div></div>

The processes and tools must present verifiable results as to how they produce evidence that is complete, authentic, and accurate, and has integrity and accuracy. While there has been a call from within the discipline emphasizing a scientific review of tools and processes, there have been complaints about the reliability of the tools. Questions have been raised as to their capability to gather data and the susceptibility of the imaged data to forgery.</p><p>Reports emerge from time to time of the apparent malfunction of some types of forensic hardware <a id="id322" class="indexterm"/>during data recovery, raising doubts as to the effectiveness of the imaging and hashing process. There have been earlier complaints from practitioners of forensic tools being incapable of detecting and recovering hidden data stored<a id="id323" class="indexterm"/> in the <span class="strong"><strong>Host Protected Sectors</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>HPA</strong></span>) and the <span class="strong"><strong>Device Configuration Overlay</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>DCO</strong></span>), thus raising doubts as to the effectiveness of the<a id="id324" class="indexterm"/> tool's imaging capabilities. My co-research developers have identified shortcomings in mobile phone tools to recover all that is recoverable from many of these devices.</p><p>Other observers have been disappointed with the paucity of academic research being successfully transitioned to practitioners, further compounded by forensic tool vendors being relatively uninformed about academic forensic research. Practitioners are in the hands of the vendors, who may find little profitability in continuing to invest much time and money in selling tools to a relatively small market of cash-strapped law enforcement officers. Banality also rules supreme in the commonplace acceptance of a generally low standard of tools.</p><p>The courts have a not unreasonable expectation that practitioners and the tools they use are eminently suitable<a id="id325" class="indexterm"/> for the job. Court and legislative standards exist, but whether they have any positive effect on raising the quality of forensic tools is questionable. While standards do exist, they appear to be seldom adhered to in many jurisdictions and paid little real heed by vendors designing and trialing new tools or versions. A preoccupation with profit-seeking by vendors, their apparent lack of understanding of the real needs of practitioners, and lack of first-hand forensic experience may well have contributed to the low quality of forensic tools available today.</p><p>The following subsections discuss the standards for digital forensic tools, their reliability to recover and protect digital evidence, and the emergence of new tools that overcome some of the major challenges in evidence recovery.</p><div class="section" title="Standards for digital forensic tools"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec76"/>Standards for digital forensic tools</h2></div></div></div><p>Various software <a id="id326" class="indexterm"/>packages assist practitioners in searching large datasets for suspected evidence. These tools filter and reduce large amounts of data into more manageable collations. They also assist in carving out deleted files and locating hidden data. Tools<a id="id327" class="indexterm"/> such as ILookIX, using <span class="strong"><strong>Xtreme File Recovery</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>XFR</strong></span>), designed and field tested by <span class="strong"><strong>information and communications technology</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>ICT</strong></span>) experts and practitioners, will identify and open folders and files and can also<a id="id328" class="indexterm"/> salvage data that other tools simply do not notice and which remain undetected and unused. Consequently, the tedium is now being removed from wading through the large, disorganized data output conventional tools produce. This means quicker resolution of case analysis through more automated, intelligent filesystem analysis.</p><p>The standards governing information security are outlined in ISO/IEC 27041/2015, which sets guidelines for validating forensic tools. This is intended to ensure that tools are suitable for use<a id="id329" class="indexterm"/> in forensic recovery and analysis. Many commentators say that these standards lack depth and sufficient detail for anyone to understand what they mean and they encourage designers to apply them ad hoc into the design of new forensic tools and applications. The rapid and ongoing changes to digital technology hardly lend themselves to being absorbed into some form of regulatory guideline without some concerted effort being made by those who set the standards.</p><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>National Institute of Standards and Technology</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>NIST</strong></span>), based in the United States, manages the <a id="id330" class="indexterm"/>Computer Forensics Tool Testing initiative, which attempts to ensure that forensic tools meet the expectations of courts. In particular, the initiative is intended to make sure the tools are reliable, provide accurate recovery, and minimize any data contamination during imaging and analysis.</p><p>In 2014, the United Kingdom's Forensic Science Regulator released a draft guideline called <span class="strong"><strong>Digital Forensics Method Validation</strong></span>, focusing on the validation of processes used to recover digital <a id="id331" class="indexterm"/>evidence. The proposed guidelines require that all recovery processes produce reliable evidence and that adequate documentation detailing the steps followed to validate their processes be created and retained. However, similar<a id="id332" class="indexterm"/> to the <span class="strong"><strong>National Institute of Standards and Technology</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>NIST</strong></span>) guidelines, no specific criterion is provided regarding "the integrity of the case files and chain of custody, despite them being an important part of digital forensics processes." (<span class="emphasis"><em>McCutcheon, 2014</em></span>)</p><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>International Organization on Computer Evidence</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>IOCE</strong></span>) stipulates that forensic software tools, including imaging packages, require independent assessment of the validity or some assurance <a id="id333" class="indexterm"/>from the software provider that it would support the validity of its product in court hearings if required. Most digital forensic tools are commercial software applications and hardware and are not independently validated, and some may be customized by the user. The IOCE has identified the impracticality and prohibitive expense of the independent validation of all tools, relying on a more pragmatic solution to validation-checking through greater cooperation between law enforcement agencies to identify suitable and reliable tools and then sharing the results of trials, testing any deficiencies identified with the tools.</p><p>It should be recalled that the Daubert Test benchmarks the validity of forensic processes and tools. This sometimes requires the manufacturers of these tools to explain and verify the efficacy of their tools so that courts may determine their suitability. Most of these digital forensics tools have been accepted in a wide range of jurisdictions with little or no challenge as to their soundness and accuracy. In the United States, the Daubert Test and court conventions are less likely to accept the soundness of a tool based on any unqualified claim by the manufacturer or practitioner without some form of formal and scientific assurances.</p><p>To some extent, there has been a lackluster approach to sharing information about the development of better-quality forensic tools that meet practitioners' needs, further aggravated by a lack of standards for tools and any form of real compliance requirement in many jurisdictions.</p><p>This has resulted in a duplication of efforts to address the same problems and the denying of efficacious<a id="id334" class="indexterm"/> research and gains to produce valid forensic tools. For some 10 years or more, it has been recognized that future analyses of large datasets will become increasingly time-consuming, further aggravated by requirements to produce timely results for stakeholders. Moreover, predominantly human involvement in analyzing large datasets has been unavoidable because of the absence of sophisticated, automated recovery and analysis techniques. Such time restrictions and manual intervention hinders the practitioner, who is also expected to provide expert witness testimony in addition to producing the recovered evidence.</p></div><div class="section" title="The reliability of forensic imaging tools to recover and protect digital evidence"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec77"/>The reliability of forensic imaging tools to recover and protect digital evidence</h2></div></div></div><p>The IOCE has asserted, perhaps <a id="id335" class="indexterm"/>with a lack of full investigation into the matter, that the forensic imaging of hard drives<a id="id336" class="indexterm"/> is a straightforward process dependent on having its accuracy confirmed by a reliable verification tool.</p><p>Forensic images must be verifiable as authentic copies for them to be admissible. This is typically achieved through a hashing process, which is the current standard for proving the integrity of forensic images and is used to prove the identical nature of two files or images. These hashes, often stored as unprotected text files, must be protected as they may vulnerable to tampering or alteration difficult to detect. This protection requires completing complex mathematical operations on the image during acquisition and recording the results for future comparison.</p><p>Hash reports are linked to digital evidence files and are constructs that store the files from the source device and store logs, hashes, and other information describing the acquisition process, but in reality, these processes fail to increase the security or integrity of the image file, as they may be deliberately modified. A transgressor could simply recalculate the hashes with altered input. An encrypted image file could be modified by those with access to the decryption key. This is a position an honest practitioner would not wish to be in and a dishonest one not overly concerned with, as any interference might be unlikely to be detected even if it were suspected.</p><p>Digital evidence image files are most commonly preserved in the <code class="literal">E01</code> and Advanced Forensic formats, which claim to preserve and protect data recovered from computer devices. The images may be hashed to later verify that the evidence is the same as that copied from the original device and has not been altered in any way. Until recently, it had been assumed that when these image files had been password protected and encrypted, they could not be manipulated without detection. File image acquisition logs were intended to be<a id="id337" class="indexterm"/> inviolable, but those created by popular forensic imagers such as FTK Imager and EnCase are now known to be vulnerable to exploitation.</p><p>However, McCutcheon (<span class="emphasis"><em>2014, p. 49-52</em></span>) has demonstrated that the <code class="literal">E01</code> forensic image format, which dominates some 90 percent of the forensic imaging environment, is not contamination proof: McCutcheon demonstrated that with unsophisticated editing tools, <code class="literal">E01</code> images can be tampered with without being detected or practitioners having the ability to authenticate the forensic image. This revelation has attracted little or no response to seek for better imaging such as that offered by the <code class="literal">.ASB</code> image container, which is no stranger to the discipline.</p><p>Experimentation by McCutcheon unequivocally demonstrated that the metadata contained within an <code class="literal">E01</code> image could be manipulated using open source third-party libraries, raising <a id="id338" class="indexterm"/>doubts as to the effectiveness of commonly used software processes to check the validity of forensic images. These findings show that file data and metadata could be altered as well as the image acquisition logs and, with a modicum of skill, be camouflaged to prevent detection by <a id="id339" class="indexterm"/>tools such as <span class="strong"><strong>Forensic Toolkit</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>FTK</strong></span>) and <a id="id340" class="indexterm"/>
<span class="strong"><strong>EnCase</strong></span>. At the time of writing this, these tools were simply unable to authenticate the integrity of the image files. This means that such evidence can be challenged if the opposing team believed there was a suggestion of any impropriety on the part of the practitioner during the imaging process or there were doubts as to the integrity of the data recovered and imaged.</p><p>The following link will provide you<a id="id341" class="indexterm"/> with more information regarding this experiment:</p><p>

</p><p>My field and laboratory testing of the IXImager <code class="literal">.ASB</code> evidence container confirmed claims that it does securely store a forensic image inside a protected evidence container. It offers a solution to the concerns about evidence authentication raised by McCutcheon in 2014. These experiments, completed in 2015, provided some significant and encouraging results, as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Unlike EnCase Forensic Imager, which records null data relating to the altered data, IXImager self-authenticates an altered image and repairs it by writing zeros to the altered space, making it possible to detect the adulterated sectors, thereby alerting the practitioner to those specific sectors of the image that have been subject to alteration.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">When opened with the imaging application IXImager, the application verifies that the image had been modified and is no longer authentic.

NIST has, at the time of writing this, not looked at this practice, which potentially diminishes the value of forensic images. However, IXImager, which creates the <code class="literal">.ASB</code> container, is the only 100-percent NIST-certified imaging software (<span class="emphasis"><em>NIST, 2013</em></span>). This situation has not altered at the time of writing this chapter in 2016.</p><p>IXImager is loaded through a CD or USB thumb drive when booting the device and provides a safe harbor for the forensic image and the embedded imaging log sheet. Furthermore, its write-blocking software avoids the use of expensive hardware write blockers and multiple dongles. Tests on the speed of data imaging also put this software ahead of its competitors.</p><p>There have been concerns expressed that digital forensic tools are inappropriate for use on networked computers, being oriented to imaging and analyzing single computers removed from networks. Recovery requirements would stipulate online local or remote analysis of networked systems that does not contaminate evidence during the imaging and recovery <a id="id344" class="indexterm"/>processes. <a class="link" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. The Need for Enhanced Forensic Tools">Chapter 5</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>The Need for Enhanced Forensic Tools</em></span>, looks at a solution to this problem in some detail.</p><p>The next section presents two Australian case studies that stress the importance of maintaining the<a id="id345" class="indexterm"/> highest professional standards when recovering digital evidence and emphasizes the importance of evidence preservation. They beg the question as to why law enforcement agencies over-rely on specialist digital forensic units rather than providing some sound basic digital para-forensic training and more effective tools for rank-and-file officers, for it is they who are often the first respondents at crime scenes that are increasingly involving computing devices of some form or other.</p></div></div>

This was epitomized in the case of indecent possession of child pornography in the jury trial of Mowday versus the State of Western Australia (2007). The case illustrated the failure of the trial judge to reject digital evidence where serious doubts on the antecedents about its safekeeping were raised by the defense lawyer at the commencement of the trial. Consequently, during the appeal proceedings, the digital evidence in the Mowday case was rejected as being invalid and specific <a id="id347" class="indexterm"/>convictions were reversed.

</p><p>In a 2008 child pornography case in Australia, child pornography videos and picture files were located on the defendant's laptop by a computer technician tasked previously by the defendant to upgrade the device and remove suspected malware. In the process of upgrading the computer with new memory chips, the operating system was deleted and the defendant's personal data was saved to the technician's backup computer. After defragmenting the hard drive, the operating system was reinstalled on the laptop and the defendant's personal data was copied on to the laptop. No special forensic tools were used to copy, remove, and later restore this personal data to the laptop.</p><p>During the copying process, the technician opened some video files that appeared to depict child pornography. Local police were notified of a possible offence, visited the workshop, and directed the technician to copy the data to a DVD, which was duly handed to the police officers. On police instructions, personal data was restored to the laptop and it was then returned to the defendant for later seizure. Subsequently, the police officers lost the DVD.</p><p>The laptop was held on a shelf in the technician's office for several weeks while awaiting the arrival of the correct memory chip. Other technicians had access to the room where the laptop was casually stored, yet no attempt was made by the police team to seize the laptop and preserve the evidence. This very fact led to the case being challenged on the grounds that no chain of custody was in place prior to the laptop being seized some considerable time later during a raid on the defendant's residence by a specialist computer team.</p><p>Two mistrials occurred. A third retrial eventuated in some of the digital evidence being determined by the judge as being unreliable because of anomalous file metadata—hardly surprising when the drive had been wiped and then more data placed on it. A comparison of the restored data and the original data deleted from the laptop could not be provided. There remained the possibility that the restored data may have differed from the original data or had been manipulated.</p><p>However, the jury convicted the defendant on the remaining possession charges despite the defense counsel making repeated and vigorous challenges to the absence of a reliable chain of custody that would prevent tampering of the evidence.</p><p>A subsequent appeal by the defendant was disallowed and the appeal court noted that the defendant had made some verbal admissions to the possession of child pornography on the laptop. Despite the appalling lack of any duty of care of the data contained on the defendant's laptop and the loss of the copy of the DVD, the evidence was allowed to be presented to the jury.</p><p>The onus was on the prosecution to verify that the digital evidence was in pristine condition, when it clearly was not. In drug trafficking and child pornography possession cases, there is a<a id="id348" class="indexterm"/> reversal of the presumption of proof of innocence, leaving defendants having to prove that they were not aware of possession of illegal or offensive material. It seems incredulous that the evidence was regarded as admissible when in fact its authenticity seemed in doubt—a view shared by the prosecution lawyer! What may have influenced the jury in reaching its guilty verdict was a partial admission of guilt by the defendant during a video interview.</p><p>Such lack of professionalism in digital forensic investigations is regrettably not uncommon. Information that is intended to form part of court proceedings or information that could conceivably be used as evidence must be handled carefully and protected. There is no room for a casual and lackadaisical approach. So, dear reader, if you are contemplating becoming part of the discipline, be disciplined when it comes to evidence handling.</p></div>

<div class="section" title="Summary"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl1sec40"/>Summary</h1></div></div></div><p>This chapter looked at evidence recovery and preservation in a general sense and then focused on how these two interlinked requirements relate to digital evidence. From the physical safekeeping of the exhibits that hold digital information to the recovery of it in its digital form, the chapter outlined the responsibilities of practitioners as well as the challenges that confront them in evidence handling.</p><p>Dead and live evidence recovery processes have been described, although these well-established processes are now facing a paradigm shift heralded by enhanced technologies. New and sounder ways of recovering and preserving evidence were presented as was a more reliable and efficient way of forensic imaging.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. The Need for Enhanced Forensic Tools">Chapter 5</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>The Need for Enhanced Forensic Tools</em></span>, will look at new processes and technologies that address and overcome some of the disadvantages of live recovery by introducing some "disruptive technology" that has arrived just in time to give practitioners the edge in forensic examinations. This will enable you to build on the knowledge gained from this chapter and provide an exciting look into the newly emerging environment of digital evidence recovery and handling.</p><p>The chapter will also highlight the rapidly changing forensic environment, where conventional forensic imaging and indexing of increasingly larger datasets is becoming unviable. It will introduce new forensic processes and tools to assist in sounder evidence recovery and better use of resources. This "disruptive technology" is already challenging the established digital forensic response and overreliance on forensic specialists, who are themselves becoming swamped with increased caseloads and an inability to process larger and disparate datasets.</p></div></body></html>
