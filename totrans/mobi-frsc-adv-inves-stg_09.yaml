    OS prior to BlackBerry 10, the users can configure it to produce offline backups
    protected with a user-selectable password. If, however, the device is running

    OS, BlackBerry devices could be configured to produce password-protected offline
    backups (`*.ipd` or `*.bbb` backup files) when connected to an authorized computer
    running BlackBerry Desktop Software. It is important to note that these backups
    were only protected with a user-selectable password. Unlike Apple, BlackBerry
    has not specified the use of any additional hardware-based encryption keys. As

- en: With BlackBerry losing its market share, the main reason to buy a BlackBerry
    is security. As a result, encryption is likely to be enabled on a BlackBerry 10
    device being acquired. With encryption enabled, chip-off acquisition of a BlackBerry
    10 phone is pointless without a valid decryption key, which cannot be dumped during
    chip-off.
