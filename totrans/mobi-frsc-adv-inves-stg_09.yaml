    OS prior to BlackBerry 10, the users can configure it to produce offline backups
    protected with a user-selectable password. If, however, the device is running
    BlackBerry 10, the backups are stored in an online cloud, and require the original

    OS, BlackBerry devices could be configured to produce password-protected offline
    backups (`*.ipd` or `*.bbb` backup files) when connected to an authorized computer
    running BlackBerry Desktop Software. It is important to note that these backups
    were only protected with a user-selectable password. Unlike Apple, BlackBerry
    has not specified the use of any additional hardware-based encryption keys. As
    a result, successfully recovering a password is all that is needed to decrypt

- en: With BlackBerry losing its market share, the main reason to buy a BlackBerry
    is security. As a result, encryption is likely to be enabled on a BlackBerry 10
    device being acquired. With encryption enabled, chip-off acquisition of a BlackBerry
    10 phone is pointless without a valid decryption key, which cannot be dumped during
    chip-off.
