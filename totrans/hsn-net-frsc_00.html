<p class="mce-root"><span>Network forensics is a subset of digital forensics that deals with network attacks and their investigation. In the era of network attacks and malware threats, it's now more important than ever to have the skills required to investigate network attacks and vulnerabilities.</span></p>
<p class="mce-root"><span><em>Hands-On Network Forensics</em> starts with the core concepts within network forensics, including coding, networking, forensics tools, and methodologies for forensic investigations. You'll then explore the tools used for network forensics, followed by understanding how to apply those tools to a PCAP file and write the accompanying report. In addition to this, you will understand how statistical flow analysis, network enumeration, tunneling and encryption, and malware detection can be used to investigate your network. Toward the end of this book, you will discover how network correlation works and how to bring all the information from different types of network devices together.</span></p>
<p class="mce-root"><span>By the end of this book, you will have gained hands-on experience of performing forensic analysis tasks.</span></p>
