<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.1">When examining threats to today’s </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.1">information technology</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.1">IT</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.1">), it seems overwhelming. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.2">From simple</span><a id="_idIndexMarker000"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.1"> script kiddies using off-the-shelf code to nation-state adversary tools, it is critical to be prepared. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.2">For example, an internal employee can download a single instance of ransomware and that can have a significant impact on an organization. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.3">More complex attacks, such as a network exploitation attempt or a targeted data breach, increase the chaos that a security incident causes. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.4">Technical personnel will have their hands full attempting to determine which systems have been impacted and how they are being manipulated. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.5">They will also have to contend with addressing the possible loss of data through compromised systems. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.6">Adding to this chaotic situation are senior managers haranguing them for updates and an answer to the all-important questions: </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.1">How did this happen?</span></em> <em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.1">Was this a web server vulnerability or a phishing email that led to lateral movement?</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.1"> Management also wants to know: </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.1">How bad is it?</span></em> <em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.1">Is the damage limited to the web server or is a large portion of the network compromised?</span></em></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.1">Having the ability to properly respond to security incidents in an orderly and efficient manner allows organizations to both limit the damage of a potential cyber attack and also recover from the associated damage that is caused. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.2">To facilitate this orderly response, organizations of all sizes have looked at adding an </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.1">incident response</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.1">IR</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.1">) capability to their existing policies, procedures, and processes.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.1">In order to build this capability within the organization, several key components must be addressed. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.2">First, organizations need to have a working knowledge of the IR process. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.3">This process outlines the general flow of an incident and general actions that are taken at each stage. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.4">Second, organizations need to have access to personnel who form the nucleus of any IR capability. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.5">Once a team is organized, a formalized plan and associated processes need to be created. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.6">This written plan and processes form an orderly structure that an organization can follow during an incident. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.7">Finally, with this framework in place, the plan must be continually evaluated, tested, and improved as new threats emerge. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.8">Utilizing this framework will position organizations to be prepared for the unfortunate reality that many organizations have already faced, an incident that compromises their security.</span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.1">The IR process</span><a id="_idIndexMarker005"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.1"> can be broken down into the following six distinct phases, each with a set of actions the organization can take to address the incident:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.1">Preparation</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.1">: Without good preparation, any subsequent</span><a id="_idIndexMarker006"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.1"> IR is going to be disorganized and has the potential to make the incident worse. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.2">One of the critical components of preparation is the creation of an IR plan. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.3">Once a plan is in place with the necessary staffing, ensure that personnel detailed with IR duties are properly trained. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.4">This includes processes, procedures, and any additional tools necessary for the investigation of an incident. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.5">In addition to a plan, tools such as forensics hardware and software should be acquired and incorporated into the overall process. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.6">Finally, regular exercises should be conducted to ensure that the organization is trained and familiar with the process.</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.1">Detection</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.1">: The detection of potential incidents</span><a id="_idIndexMarker007"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.1"> is a complex endeavor. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.2">Depending on the size of the organization, they may have over 100 million separate events per day. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.3">These events can be records of legitimate actions taken during the normal course of business or be indicators of potentially malicious activity. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.4">Couple this mountain of event data with other security</span><a id="_idIndexMarker008"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.1"> controls constantly alerting to activity and you have a situation where analysts are inundated with data and must subsequently sift out the valuable pieces of signal from the vastness</span><a id="_idIndexMarker009"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.1"> of network noise. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.2">Even today’s cutting-edge </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.1">Security Information and Event Management</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.1">SIEM</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.1">) tools lose their effectiveness if they are not properly maintained with regular updates of rulesets that identify which events qualify as a potential incident. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.2">The detection phase is that part of the IR process where the organization first becomes aware of a set of events that possibly indicates malicious activity. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.3">These events that have been detected and are indicative of malicious behavior are then classified as an incident. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.4">For example, a security analyst may receive an alert that a specific administrator account was in use when the administrator was on vacation. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.5">Detection</span><a id="_idIndexMarker010"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.1"> may also come from external sources. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.2">An </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.1">internet service provider</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.1">ISP</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.1">) or law enforcement agency may detect malicious activity originating in an organization’s network and contact them to advise them of the situation. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.2">In other instances, users may be the first to indicate a potential security incident. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.3">This may be as simple as an employee contacting the help desk and informing a help desk technician that they received an Excel spreadsheet from an unknown source and opened it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.4">They are now complaining that their files on the local system are being encrypted. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.5">In each case, an organization would have to escalate each of these events to the level of an incident (which we will cover a little later in this chapter) and begin the reactive process to investigate and remediate.</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.1">Analysis</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.1">: Once an incident has been detected, personnel</span><a id="_idIndexMarker011"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.1"> from the organization or a trusted third party will begin the analysis phase. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.2">In this phase, personnel begins the task of collecting evidence from systems such as running memory, log files, network connections, and running software processes. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.3">Depending on the type of incident, this collection can take from as little as a few hours to several days. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.4">Once evidence is collected, it then needs to be examined. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.5">There are a variety of tools to conduct this analysis, many of which are explored in this book. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.6">With these tools, analysts attempt to ascertain</span><a id="_idIndexMarker012"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.1"> what happened, what it affected, whether any other systems were involved, and whether any confidential data was removed. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.2">The ultimate goal of the analysis is to determine the root cause of the incident and reconstruct the actions of the threat actor, from initial compromise to detection.</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.1">Containment</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.1">: Once there is a solid understanding</span><a id="_idIndexMarker013"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.1"> of what the incident is and which systems are involved, organizations can then move into the containment phase. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.2">In this phase, organizations take measures to limit the ability of threat actors to continue compromising</span><a id="_idIndexMarker014"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.1"> other network resources, communicating with </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.1">command and control</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.1">C2</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.1">) infrastructures, or exfiltrating confidential data. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.2">Containment strategies can range</span><a id="_idIndexMarker015"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.1"> from locking down ports and </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.1">Internet Protocol</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.1">IP</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.1">) addresses on a firewall to simply removing the network cable from the back of an infected machine. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.2">Each type of incident involves its own containment strategy, but having several options allows personnel to stop the bleeding at the source if they are able to detect a security incident before or while threat actors are pilfering data.</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.1">Eradication and recovery</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.1">: During the eradication phase, the organization</span><a id="_idIndexMarker016"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.1"> removes the threat actor from the impacted network. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.2">In the case of a malware infection, the organization may run an enhanced anti-malware solution. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.3">Other times, infected machines must be wiped and reimaged. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.4">Other activities include removing or changing compromised user accounts. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.5">If an organization has identified a vulnerability that was exploited, vendor patches are applied or software updates are made. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.6">Recovery activities</span><a id="_idIndexMarker017"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.1"> are very closely aligned with those</span><a id="_idIndexMarker018"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.1"> that may be found in an organization’s </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.1">business continuity</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.90.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.1">BC</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.92.1">) or </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.1">disaster recovery</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.1">DR</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.96.1">) plans. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.96.2">In this phase of the process, organizations reinstall fresh operating systems or applications. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.96.3">They will also restore data on local systems from backups. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.96.4">As a due diligence step, organizations will also audit their existing user and administrator accounts to ensure that no accounts have been enabled by threat actors. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.96.5">Finally, a comprehensive vulnerability scan is conducted so that the organization is confident that any exploitable</span><a id="_idIndexMarker019"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.1"> vulnerabilities have been removed.</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.1">Post-incident activity</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.99.1">: At the conclusion of the incident process</span><a id="_idIndexMarker020"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.100.1"> is a complete review of the incident with all principal stakeholders. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.100.2">Post-incident activity includes a complete review of all actions taken during the incident. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.100.3">What worked and—more importantly—what did not work are important topics for discussion. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.100.4">These reviews are important because they may highlight specific tasks and actions that had either a positive or negative impact on the outcome of the IR. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.100.5">It is during this phase of the process that a written report is completed. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.100.6">Documenting the actions taken during the incident is critical to capture both what occurred and whether the incident will ever see the inside of a courtroom. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.100.7">For documentation to be effective, it should be detailed and show a clear chain of events with a focus on the root cause, if it was determined. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.100.8">Personnel involved in the preparation of this report should realize that stakeholders outside of IT might read this report. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.100.9">As a result, technical jargon or concepts should be explained.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.101.1">Finally, the organizational personnel should update their own IR processes with any new information developed during the post-incident debrief and reporting. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.101.2">This incorporation of lessons learned is important as it makes future responses to incidents more effective.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-17"><a id="_idTextAnchor016"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.102.1">The role of digital forensics</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.103.1">There is a misconception</span><a id="_idIndexMarker021"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.104.1"> that is often held by people unfamiliar</span><a id="_idIndexMarker022"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.105.1"> with the realm of IR, which is that IR is merely a digital forensics issue. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.105.2">As a result, they will often conflate the two terms. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.105.3">While digital forensics is a critical component of IR (and for this reason, we have included a number of chapters in this book that address digital forensics), there is more to addressing an incident than examining hard drives. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.105.4">It is best to think of forensics as a supporting function of the overall IR process. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.105.5">Digital forensics serves as the mechanism for understanding the technical aspects of an incident, potentially identifying the root cause, and discovering unidentified access or other</span><a id="_idIndexMarker023"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.106.1"> malicious activity. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.106.2">For example, some incidents such as </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.107.1">denial-of-service</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.108.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.109.1">DoS</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.110.1">) attacks will require little to no forensic work. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.110.2">On the other hand, a network intrusion involving the compromise of an internal server and C2 traffic leaving the network will require extensive examination of logs, traffic analysis, and examination of memory. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.110.3">From this analysis, the root cause may be derived. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.110.4">In both cases, the impacted organization would be able to connect with the incident, but forensics plays a much more important role in the latter case.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.111.1">IR is an information security function</span><a id="_idIndexMarker024"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.112.1"> that uses the methodologies, tools, and techniques of digital forensics</span><a id="_idIndexMarker025"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.113.1"> but goes beyond what digital forensics provides by addressing additional elements. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.113.2">These elements include containing possible malware or other exploits, identifying and remediating vulnerabilities, and managing various technical and non-technical personnel. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.113.3">Some incidents may require the analysis of host-based evidence or memory while others may only require a firewall log review but, in each, the responders will follow the IR process.</span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-18"><a id="_idTextAnchor017"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.114.1">The IR framework</span></h1>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.115.1">Responding to a data breach, ransomware</span><a id="_idIndexMarker026"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.116.1"> attack, or another security incident should never be an ad hoc process. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.116.2">Undefined processes or procedures will leave an organization unable to both identify the extent of the incident and be able to stop the bleeding in sufficient time to limit the damage. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.116.3">Further, attempting to craft plans during an incident may, in fact, destroy critical evidence or—worse—create more problems.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.117.1">Having a solid understanding of the IR process is just the first step to building this capability within an organization. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.117.2">What organizations need is a framework that puts processes to work utilizing the organization’s available resources. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.117.3">An IR framework describes the components of a functional IR capability within an organization. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.117.4">This framework is made up of elements such as personnel, policies, procedures, and implementation. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.117.5">It is through these elements that an organization builds its capability to respond to incidents.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-19"><a id="_idTextAnchor018"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.118.1">The IR charter</span></h2>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.151.1">The IR charter should be a written document that addresses the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.152.1">Obtaining senior leadership support</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.153.1">: In order to be a viable part of the organization, the CSIRT requires</span><a id="_idIndexMarker034"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.154.1"> the support of the senior leadership within the organization. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.154.2">In a private-sector institution, it may be difficult to obtain the necessary support and funding, as the CSIRT itself does not provide value in the same way marketing or sales does. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.154.3">What should be understood is that the CSIRT acts as an insurance policy in the event the worst happens. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.154.4">In this manner, a CSIRT can justify its existence by reducing the impact of incidents and thereby reducing costs associated with a security breach or other malicious activity.</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.155.1">Defining a constituency</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.156.1">: A constituency clearly defines</span><a id="_idIndexMarker035"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.157.1"> which organizational elements and domains the CSIRT has responsibility for. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.157.2">Some organizations have several divisions or subsidiaries that, for whatever reason, may not be part of the CSIRT’s responsibility. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.157.3">The constituency can be defined either as a domain such as </span><strong class="source-inline"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.158.1">local.example.com</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.159.1"> or an organization</span><a id="_idIndexMarker036"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.160.1"> name such as </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.161.1">ACME Inc.</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.162.1"> and associated subsidiary organizations.</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.163.1">Creating a mission statement</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.164.1">: Mission creep or the gradual </span><a id="_idIndexMarker037"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.165.1">expansion of the CSIRT’s responsibilities can occur without a clear definition of what the defined purpose of the CSIRT is. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.165.2">In order to counter this, a clearly defined mission statement should be included with the written information security plan. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.165.3">For example, the mission of the </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.166.1">ACME Inc.</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.167.1"> CSIRT is to provide timely analysis and actions for security incidents that impact the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.168.1">ACME Inc.</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.169.1"> information systems and personnel.</span></li>

</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.189.1">Another critical benefit of an expressly</span><a id="_idIndexMarker043"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.190.1"> stated charter is to socialize the CSIRT with the entire organization. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.190.2">This is done to remove any rumors or innuendo about the purpose of the team. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.190.3">Employees of the organization may hear terms such as </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.191.1">digital investigations</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.192.1"> or </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.193.1">IR team</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.194.1"> and believe the organization is preparing secret police specifically designed</span><a id="_idIndexMarker044"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.195.1"> to ferret out employee misconduct. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.195.2">To counter this, a short statement that includes the mission statement of the CSIRT can be made available to all employees. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.195.3">The CSIRT can also provide periodic updates to senior leadership on incidents handled to demonstrate the purpose of the team.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-20"><a id="_idTextAnchor019"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.196.1">CSIRT team</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.197.1">Once the IR charter is completed, the next stage</span><a id="_idIndexMarker045"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.198.1"> is to start staffing the CSIRT. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.198.2">Larger organizations </span><a id="_idIndexMarker046"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.199.1">with sufficient resources may be able to task personnel with IR duties full-time. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.199.2">Often, though, organizations will have to utilize personnel who have other duties outside IR. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.199.3">Personnel who comprise the internal CSIRT can be divided into three categories: core team, technical support, and organizational support. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.199.4">Everyone within the CSIRT fulfills a specific task. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.199.5">Building this capability into an organization takes more than just assigning personnel and creating a policy-and-procedure document. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.199.6">As with any major project initiative, there is a good deal of effort required in creating a functional CSIRT.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.200.1">For each of the CSIRT categories, there are specific roles and responsibilities. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.200.2">This wide range of personnel is designed to provide guidance and support through a wide range of incidents, ranging from minor to catastrophic.</span></p>
<h3><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.201.1">CSIRT core team</span></h3>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.202.1">The CSIRT core team consists of personnel</span><a id="_idIndexMarker047"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.203.1"> who have IR duties as their full-time job or assume IR activities when needed. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.203.2">In many instances, the core team is often made up of personnel assigned to the information security team. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.203.3">Other organizations can leverage personnel with expertise in IR activities. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.203.4">Here are some of the roles that can be incorporated into the core team:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.204.1">IR coordinator</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.205.1">: This is a critical component</span><a id="_idIndexMarker048"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.206.1"> of any CSIRT. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.206.2">Without clear leadership, the response to a potential incident may be disorganized or, with multiple individuals vying for control during an incident, a chaotic situation that can make</span><a id="_idIndexMarker049"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.207.1"> the incident worse. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.207.2">In many</span><a id="_idIndexMarker050"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.208.1"> instances, the IR coordinator is often the </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.209.1">chief security officer</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.210.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.211.1">CSO</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.212.1">), the </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.213.1">chief information security officer</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.214.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.215.1">CISO</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.216.1">), or the </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.217.1">information security officer</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.218.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.219.1">ISO</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.220.1">) as that individual often has overall responsibility</span><a id="_idIndexMarker051"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.221.1"> for the security of the organization’s information. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.221.2">Other organizations </span><a id="_idIndexMarker052"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.222.1">may name a single individual who serves as the IR coordinator. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.222.2">The IR coordinator is responsible for the management of the CSIRT prior to, during, and after an incident. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.222.3">In terms of preparation, the IR coordinator will ensure that any plans or policies concerning the CSIRT are reviewed periodically and updated as needed. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.222.4">In addition, the IR coordinator is responsible for ensuring that the CSIRT team is appropriately trained and also oversees testing and training for CSIRT personnel.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.223.1">During an incident, the IR coordinator</span><a id="_idIndexMarker053"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.224.1"> is responsible for ensuring the proper response and remediation of an incident and guides the team through the entire IR process. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.224.2">One of the most important of these tasks during an incident is the coordination of the CSIRT with senior leadership. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.224.3">With the stakes</span><a id="_idIndexMarker054"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.225.1"> of a data breach being high, senior leadership such as the </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.226.1">chief executive officer</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.227.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.228.1">CEO</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.229.1">) will want to be kept up-to-date in terms of critical information concerning an incident. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.229.2">It is the responsibility of the IR coordinator to ensure that senior leadership is fully informed of the activities associated with an incident, using clear and concise language. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.229.3">One stumbling block is that senior leaders within an organization may not have the acumen to understand the technical aspects of an incident, so it is important to speak in a language they will understand.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.230.1">Finally, at the conclusion of an incident, the IR coordinator is responsible for ensuring that the incident is properly documented and that reports of the CSIRT activity are delivered to the appropriate internal and external stakeholders. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.230.2">In addition, a full debrief of all CSIRT activities is conducted, and lessons learned are incorporated into the CSIRT plan.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.231.1">CSIRT senior analyst(s)</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.232.1">: CSIRT senior analysts are personnel</span><a id="_idIndexMarker055"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.233.1"> with extensive training and experience in IR and associated skills such as digital forensics or network data examination. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.233.2">They often have several years of experience conducting IR activities as either a consultant or as part of an enterprise CSIRT.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.234.1">During the preparation phase of the IR process, they are involved in ensuring that they have the necessary skills and training to address their specific role in the CSIRT. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.234.2">They are also often directed to assist in the IR plan review and modification. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.234.3">Finally, senior analysts will often take part in training junior members of the team.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.235.1">Once an incident has been</span><a id="_idIndexMarker056"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.236.1"> identified, senior analysts will engage with other CSIRT members</span><a id="_idIndexMarker057"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.237.1"> to acquire and analyze evidence, direct containment activities, and assist other personnel with remediation.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.238.1">At the conclusion of an incident, senior analysts will ensure that both they and other personnel appropriately document the incident. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.238.2">This will include the preparation of reports to internal and external stakeholders. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.238.3">They will also ensure that any evidence is appropriately archived or destroyed, depending on the IR plan.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.239.1">CSIRT analyst(s)</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.240.1">: CSIRT analysts are personnel</span><a id="_idIndexMarker058"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.241.1"> with CSIRT responsibilities that have less exposure or experience in IR activities. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.241.2">Oftentimes, they have only 1 or 2 years of experience in responding to incidents. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.241.3">As a result, they can perform a variety of activities, with some of those under the direction of senior analysts.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.242.1">In terms of preparation-phase activities, analysts will develop their skills via training and exercises. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.242.2">They may also take part in reviews and updates to the IR plan. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.242.3">During an incident, they will be tasked with gathering evidence from potentially compromised hosts, network devices, or various log sources. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.242.4">Analysts will also take part in the analysis of evidence and assist other team members in remediation activities.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.243.1">Security operations center (SOC) analyst</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.244.1">: Larger enterprises may have an in-house</span><a id="_idIndexMarker059"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.245.1"> or contracted 24/7 SOC monitoring capability. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.245.2">Analysts assigned to the SOC will often serve as the point person when it comes to incident detection and alerting. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.245.3">As a result, having a SOC analyst as part of the team allows them to be trained in incident identification and response techniques</span><a id="_idIndexMarker060"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.246.1"> and serve as an almost immediate response to a potential security incident.</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.247.1">IT security engineer/analyst(s)</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.248.1">: Depending on the size of the organization, there</span><a id="_idIndexMarker061"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.249.1"> may be personnel specifically </span><a id="_idIndexMarker062"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.250.1">tasked with the deployment, maintenance, and monitoring of security-related software such as anti-virus or hardware such as firewalls or SIEM systems. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.250.2">Having direct access to these devices is critical when an incident has been identified. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.250.3">The personnel assigned these duties will often have a direct role in the entire IR process.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.251.1">The IT security engineer or analyst will be responsible for the preparation component of the IR process. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.251.2">They will be the primary resource to ensure that security applications and devices are properly configured to alert to possible incidents and to ensure that the devices properly log events so that a reconstruction of events can take place.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.252.1">During an incident, they will be tasked with monitoring security systems for other indicators of malicious behavior. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.252.2">They will also assist other CSIRT personnel with obtaining evidence from security devices. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.252.3">Finally, after an incident, this personnel will be tasked with configuring security devices to monitor suspected behavior, to ensure that remediation activities have eradicated malicious activity on impacted systems.</span></p>
<h3><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.253.1">Technical support personnel</span></h3>
<p><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.254.1">Technical support personnel</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.255.1"> are those individuals within the organization</span><a id="_idIndexMarker063"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.256.1"> who do not have CSIRT activities</span><a id="_idIndexMarker064"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.257.1"> as part of their day-to-day operations, but rather have expertise or access to systems and processes that may be affected by an incident. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.257.2">For example, the CSIRT may need to engage a server administrator to assist the core team with acquiring evidence from servers such as memory captures, acquiring virtual systems, or offloading log files. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.257.3">Once </span><a id="_idIndexMarker065"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.258.1">completed, the server administrator’s role is completed and they may have no further involvement in the incident. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.258.2">Here are some of the personnel that can be of assistance to the CSIRT during an incident:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.259.1">Network architect/administrator</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.260.1">: Often, incidents involve the network infrastructure. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.260.2">This includes</span><a id="_idIndexMarker066"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.261.1"> attacks on routers, switches, and other network hardware and software. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.261.2">The network architect or administrator is vital for insight into what is normal and abnormal behavior for these devices, as well as for identifying anomalous network traffic. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.261.3">In incidents where the network infrastructure is involved, these support personnel can assist with obtaining network evidence such as access logs or packet captures.</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.262.1">Server administrator</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.263.1">: Threat actors often target systems</span><a id="_idIndexMarker067"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.264.1"> within the network where</span><a id="_idIndexMarker068"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.265.1"> critical or sensitive data is stored. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.265.2">These high-value targets often include domain controllers, file servers, or database servers. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.265.3">Server administrators can aid in acquiring log files from these systems. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.265.4">If the server administrator(s) are also responsible for the maintenance of the Active Directory structure, they may be able to assist with identifying new user accounts or changes to existing user or administrator accounts.</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.266.1">Application support</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.267.1">: Web applications are a prime target</span><a id="_idIndexMarker069"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.268.1"> for threat actors. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.268.2">Flaws in coding that allow attacks such as </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.269.1">Structured Query Language</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.270.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.271.1">SQL</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.272.1">) injection or security misconfigurations</span><a id="_idIndexMarker070"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.273.1"> are responsible for some security breaches. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.273.2">As a result, having application support personnel as part of the CSIRT facilitates the finding of information directly related to application attacks. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.273.3">These individuals will often be able to identify code changes or confirm vulnerabilities discovered during an investigation into a potential attack against an application.</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.274.1">Desktop support</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.275.1">: Desktop support personnel are often</span><a id="_idIndexMarker071"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.276.1"> involved in maintaining controls such as data loss prevention and anti-virus on desktop systems. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.276.2">In the event of an incident, they can assist in providing the CSIRT</span><a id="_idIndexMarker072"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.277.1"> with log files and other evidence. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.277.2">They may also be responsible for cleaning up infected systems during the remediation phase of an incident.</span></li>

<h3><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.282.1">Organizational support personnel</span></h3>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.283.1">Outside of the technical</span><a id="_idIndexMarker075"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.284.1"> realm, other organizational members</span><a id="_idIndexMarker076"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.285.1"> should also be included within the CSIRT. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.285.2">Organizational personnel can assist with a variety of non-technical issues that fall outside those that are addressed by the CSIRT core and technical support personnel. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.285.3">These include navigating the internal and external legal environment, assisting with customer communications, or supporting CSIRT personnel while on-site.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.286.1">Here are some of the organizational support personnel that should be included in a CSIRT plan:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.287.1">Legal</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.288.1">: Data breaches and other incidents</span><a id="_idIndexMarker077"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.289.1"> carry a variety of legal issues along with them. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.289.2">Many countries now have breach notification laws where organizations are required to notify customers</span><a id="_idIndexMarker078"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.290.1"> that their information was put at risk. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.290.2">Other compliance requirements such as the </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.291.1">Health Insurance and Portability Act</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.292.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.293.1">HIPAA</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.294.1">) and the </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.295.1">Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.296.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.297.1">PCI DSS</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.298.1">) require the impacted organization</span><a id="_idIndexMarker079"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.299.1"> to contact various external bodies and notify them of a suspected breach. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.299.2">Including legal representation</span><a id="_idIndexMarker080"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.300.1"> early in the IR process will ensure that these notifications and any other legal requirements are addressed in a timely fashion. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.300.2">In the event that a breach has been caused by an internal source such as an employee or contractor, the impacted organization may want to recoup losses through civil action. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.300.3">Including legal representation early in the process will allow a more informed decision as to which legal process should be followed.</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.301.1">Human resources (HR)</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.302.1">: A good deal of incidents that occur in organizations</span><a id="_idIndexMarker081"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.303.1"> are perpetrated by employees or contractors. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.303.2">The investigation of actions such as fraud, all the way to massive data theft, may have to be investigated by the CSIRT. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.303.3">In the event that the target of the investigation is an employee or contractor, the HR department can assist with ensuring that the CSIRT’s actions are in compliance with applicable labor laws and company policies. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.303.4">If an employee or contractor is to be terminated, the CSIRT can coordinate with HR personnel so that all proper documentation concerning the incident is complete, to reduce the potential of a wrongful termination suit.</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.304.1">Marketing/communications</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.305.1">: If external clients or customers may be adversely impacted</span><a id="_idIndexMarker082"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.306.1"> by an incident such</span><a id="_idIndexMarker083"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.307.1"> as a DoS attack or data breach, the marketing or communications department can assist in crafting the appropriate message to assuage fears and ensure that those external entities are receiving the best information possible. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.307.2">When looking back at past data breaches where organizations attempted to keep the details to themselves and customers were not informed, there was a backlash against those organizations. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.307.3">Having a solid communications plan that is put into action early will go a long way in soothing any potentially adverse reactions from customers or clients.</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.308.1">Facilities</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.309.1">: The CSIRT may need access to areas</span><a id="_idIndexMarker084"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.310.1"> after hours or for a prolonged time. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.310.2">The facilities department can assist the CSIRT in obtaining the necessary access in a timely manner. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.310.3">Facilities also may have access to additional meeting spaces for the CSIRT to utilize in the event of a prolonged incident</span><a id="_idIndexMarker085"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.311.1"> that requires a dedicated workspace and infrastructure.</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.312.1">Corporate security</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.313.1">: The CSIRT may be called in to deal</span><a id="_idIndexMarker086"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.314.1"> with the theft of network resources or other technology from the organization. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.314.2">Laptop and digital media theft are very common. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.314.3">Corporate security will often have access to surveillance footage from entrances and exits. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.314.4">They may also maintain access badges and visitor logs for the CSIRT to track the movement of employees and other personnel within the facility. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.314.5">This can allow a reconstruction of events leading up to a theft or other circumstances that led up to an incident.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.315.1">External resources</span></h3>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.316.1">Many industries have professional organizations</span><a id="_idIndexMarker087"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.317.1"> where practitioners, regardless of their employer, can come together to share information. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.317.2">CSIRT personnel may also be tasked with interfacing with law enforcement and government agencies at times, especially if they are targeted as part of a larger attack perpetrated against a number of similar organizations. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.317.3">Having relationships with external organizations and agencies can assist the CSIRT with intelligence sharing and resources in the event of an incident. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.317.4">These resources include the following:</span></p>

<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.340.1">Vendors</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.341.1">: External vendors can be leveraged in the event</span><a id="_idIndexMarker094"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.342.1"> of an incident, and what they can provide is often dependent</span><a id="_idIndexMarker095"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.343.1"> on the specific </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.344.1">line of business</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.345.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.346.1">LOB</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.347.1">) the organization has engaged them in. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.347.2">For example, an organization’s IPS/IDS solution provider could assist with crafting custom alerting and blocking rules to assist in the detection and containment </span><a id="_idIndexMarker096"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.348.1">of malicious activity. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.348.2">Vendors with </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.349.1">threat intelligence</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.350.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.351.1">TI</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.352.1">) capability can also provide guidance on malicious activity indicators. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.352.2">Finally, some organizations will need to engage vendors who have an IR specialty such as reverse engineering malware when those skills fall outside an organization’s capability.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.353.1">Depending on the size of the organization, it is easy</span><a id="_idIndexMarker097"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.354.1"> to see how the CSIRT can involve several people. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.354.2">It is critical to putting together the entire CSIRT that each member is aware of their roles and responsibilities. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.354.3">Each member should also be asked for specific guidance on which expertise can be leveraged during the entire IR process. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.354.4">This becomes more important in the next part of the IR framework, which is the creation of an IR plan.</span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-21"><a id="_idTextAnchor020"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.355.1">The IR plan</span></h1>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.356.1">With the IR charter written and the CSIRT formed, the next step is to craft an IR plan. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.356.2">An IR plan</span><a id="_idIndexMarker098"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.357.1"> is a document that outlines the high-level structure of an organization’s response capability. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.357.2">This is a high-level document that serves as the foundation of the CSIRT. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.357.3">The major components of an IR plan are set out here:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.358.1">IR charter</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.359.1">: An IR plan should include the mission</span><a id="_idIndexMarker099"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.360.1"> statement and constituency from the IR charter. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.360.2">This gives the plan continuity between the inception of the IR capability and the IR plan.</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.361.1">Expanded services catalog</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.362.1">: The initial IR charter had general service</span><a id="_idIndexMarker100"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.363.1"> categories with no real detail, so the IR plan should include specific details of which services the CSIRT will be offering. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.363.2">For example, if forensic services are listed as part of the service offering, the IR plan may state that forensic services include evidence recovery from hard drives, memory forensics, and reverse engineering potentially malicious code in support of an incident. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.363.3">This allows the CSIRT to clearly delineate between a normal request—say, for the searching of a hard drive for an accidentally deleted document not related to an incident, and the imaging of a hard drive in connection with a declared incident.</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.364.1">CSIRT personnel</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.365.1">: As outlined before, there are a great many</span><a id="_idIndexMarker101"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.366.1"> individuals who comprise the CSIRT. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.366.2">The IR plan will clearly define these roles and responsibilities. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.366.3">Organizations should expand out from just a name and title and define exactly the roles and responsibilities of each individual. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.366.4">It is not advisable to have a turf war during an incident, and having the roles and responsibilities of CSIRT personnel clearly defined goes a long way to reducing this possibility.</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.367.1">Contact list</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.368.1">: An up-to-date contact list should be part</span><a id="_idIndexMarker102"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.369.1"> of the IR plan. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.369.2">Depending on the organization, the CSIRT may have to respond to an incident 24 hours a day. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.369.3">In this case, the IR plan should have primary and secondary contact information. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.369.4">Organizations can also make use of a rotating on-call CSIRT member who could </span><a id="_idIndexMarker103"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.370.1">serve as the first contact in the event of an incident.</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.371.1">Internal communication plan</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.372.1">: Incidents can produce a good deal of chaos</span><a id="_idIndexMarker104"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.373.1"> as personnel attempt to ascertain what is happening, which resources they need, and who to engage to address the incident. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.373.2">The IR plan internal communication guidance can address this chaos. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.373.3">This portion of the plan addresses the flow of information upward and downward between senior leadership and the CSIRT. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.373.4">Communication sideways between the CSIRT core and support personnel should also be addressed. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.373.5">This limits the individuals who are communicating with each other and cuts down on potentially conflicting instructions.</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.374.1">Training</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.375.1">: The IR plan should also indicate</span><a id="_idIndexMarker105"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.376.1"> the frequency of training for CSIRT personnel. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.376.2">At a minimum, the entire CSIRT should be put through a tabletop exercise at least annually. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.376.3">In the event that an incident post-mortem analysis indicates a gap in training, that should also be addressed within a reasonable time after the conclusion of the incident.</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.377.1">Maintenance</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.378.1">: Organizations of every size continually change. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.378.2">This can include</span><a id="_idIndexMarker106"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.379.1"> changes to infrastructure, threats, and personnel. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.379.2">The IR plan should address the frequency of reviews and updates to the IR plan. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.379.3">For example, if the organization acquires another organization, the CSIRT may have to adjust service offerings or incorporate specific individuals and their roles. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.379.4">At a minimum, the IR plan should be updated at least annually. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.379.5">Individual team members should also supplement</span><a id="_idIndexMarker107"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.380.1"> their skills through individual training and certifications through organizations such as </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.381.1">System Administration, Network, and Security</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.382.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.383.1">SANS</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.384.1">) or on specific digital forensic tools. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.384.2">Organizations can incorporate lessons learned from any exercises conducted into this update.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-22"><a id="_idTextAnchor021"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.385.1">Incident classification</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.386.1">Not all incidents are equal in their severity</span><a id="_idIndexMarker108"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.387.1"> and threat to the organization. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.387.2">For example, a virus that infects several computers in a support area of the organization will dictate a different level of response than an active compromise of a critical server. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.387.3">Treating each incident the same will quickly burn out a CSIRT as they will have to respond in the same way to even minor incidents.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.388.1">As a result, it is important to define within the IR plan an incident classification schema. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.388.2">By classifying incidents and gauging the response, organizations make better use of the CSIRT and ensure that they are not all engaged in minor issues. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.388.3">Here is a sample classification schema:</span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.421.1">One key aspect of the IR plan</span><a id="_idIndexMarker113"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.422.1"> is the use of playbooks. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.422.2">An IR playbook is a set of instructions and actions to be performed at every step in the IR process. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.422.3">Playbooks are created to give organizations a clear path through the process, but with a degree of flexibility in the event that the incident under investigation does not fit neatly into the box.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.423.1">A good indicator of which playbooks</span><a id="_idIndexMarker114"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.424.1"> are critical is the organization’s risk assessment. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.424.2">Examining the risk assessment for any threat rated critical or high will indicate which scenarios need to be addressed via an IR playbook. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.424.3">Most organizations would identify a number of threats—such as a network intrusion via a zero-day exploit, ransomware, or phishing—as critical, requiring preventive and detective controls. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.424.4">As the risk assessment has identified those as critical risks, it is best to start the playbooks with those threats.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.425.1">In the absence of a risk or threat assessment, organizations should have a minimum of five playbooks that cover the most common scenarios that they will face, as outlined here:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.426.1">Phishing</span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.427.1">Malware</span></li>

<p class="callout"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.436.1">The last several years have demonstrated the devastating impact a ransomware attack can have on an organization. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.436.2">This book will examine several scenarios as part of the overall ransomware threat to provide a better understanding of preparation and response to this type of attack.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.437.1">For example, let’s examine the breakdown of a playbook for a common threat—social engineering. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.437.2">For this playbook, we are going to divide it out into the IR process that was previously discussed, as follows:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.438.1">Preparation</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.439.1">: In this section, the organization will highlight the</span><a id="_idIndexMarker116"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.440.1"> preparation that is undertaken. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.440.2">In the case of phishing, this can include employee awareness to identify potential phishing emails or the use of an email appliance</span><a id="_idIndexMarker117"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.441.1"> that scans attachments for malware.</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.442.1">Detection</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.443.1">: For phishing attacks, organizations</span><a id="_idIndexMarker118"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.444.1"> are often alerted by aware employees or through email security controls. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.444.2">Organizations</span><a id="_idIndexMarker119"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.445.1"> should also plan on receiving alerts via malware prevention or </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.446.1">host intrusion prevention system</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.447.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.448.1">HIPS</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.449.1">) controls.</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.450.1">Analysis</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.451.1">: If an event is detected, analyzing</span><a id="_idIndexMarker120"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.452.1"> any evidence available will be critical to classifying and appropriately responding to an incident. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.452.2">In this case, the analysis may include examining the compromised host’s memory, examining event logs for suspicious entries, and reviewing any network traffic going to and from the host.</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.453.1">Containment</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.454.1">: If a host has been identified</span><a id="_idIndexMarker121"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.455.1"> as compromised, it should be isolated from the network.</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.456.1">Eradication</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.457.1">: In the event that malware</span><a id="_idIndexMarker122"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.458.1"> has been identified, it should be removed. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.458.2">If not, the playbook should have an alternative such as reimaging with a known good image.</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.459.1">Recovery</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.460.1">: The recovery stage includes</span><a id="_idIndexMarker123"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.461.1"> scanning the host for potential vulnerabilities and monitoring the system for any anomalous traffic.</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.462.1">Post-incident activity</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.463.1">: The playbook should also give guidance</span><a id="_idIndexMarker124"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.464.1"> on which actions should take place after an incident. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.464.2">Many of these actions will be the same across the catalog of playbooks but are important to include, ensuring that they are completed in full.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.465.1">The following diagram is a sample playbook for a phishing attack. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.465.2">Note that each phase of the IR cycle is addressed, as well as specific actions that should be taken as part of the response. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.465.3">Additionally, organizations can break specific actions down, such as through log analysis for a certain playbook, for greater detail:</span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.468.1">Playbooks can be configured</span><a id="_idIndexMarker125"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.469.1"> in a number of ways—for example, a written document can be added to the IR plan for specific types of incidents. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.469.2">Other times, organizations can use a flow diagram utilizing software such as iStudio or Visio. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.469.3">They are designed to give the CSIRT and any other personnel a set of instructions to follow in an incident. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.469.4">This allows less time to be wasted if a course of action is planned out. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.469.5">Playbooks serve as a guide, and they should be updated regularly, especially if they are used in an incident, and any key pieces or steps identified. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.469.6">It should be noted that playbooks are not written in stone and are not a checklist. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.469.7">CSIRT personnel are not bound to the playbook in terms of actions and should be free to undertake additional actions if the incident requires it.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-24"><a id="_idTextAnchor023"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.470.1">Escalation process</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.471.1">A critical component of the IR plan is</span><a id="_idIndexMarker126"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.472.1"> escalation procedures. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.472.2">Escalation</span><a id="_idIndexMarker127"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.473.1"> procedures outline who is responsible for moving an event or series of events from just anomalies in the information system to an incident. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.473.2">The CSIRT will become burned out if they are sent to investigate too many false positives. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.473.3">Escalation procedures ensure that the CSIRT is effectively utilized and that personnel is only contacted if their expertise is required.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.474.1">The procedures start with the parties who are most likely to observe anomalies or events in the system that may be indicative of a larger incident—for example, the help desk may receive a number of calls that indicate a potential malware infection. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.474.2">The escalation procedures may indicate that if malware is detected and cannot be removed via malware prevention controls, personnel are to contact the CSIRT member on call. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.474.3">An important consideration at this step is determining which information should be contained within the escalation report. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.474.4">The following guidelines capture the details necessary for the CSIRT </span><a id="_idIndexMarker128"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.475.1">to begin addressing the issue:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.476.1">Date and time of detection</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.477.1">: This first data point is self-explanatory. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.477.2">There are two main considerations though. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.477.3">The first</span><a id="_idIndexMarker129"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.478.1"> is the time zone. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.478.2">The preferred time zone is </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.479.1">Coordinated Universal Time</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.480.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.481.1">UTC</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.482.1">). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.482.2">This is especially useful if all systems that are logging activity are configured to UTC. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.482.3">The second is the format. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.482.4">There can be some debate, but a good all-around method is to place the date and time together in the following formation: 20220117T1637 UTC.</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.483.1">Reporting person</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.484.1">: This serves as the initial point of contact for any additional personnel that may be called into the escalation. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.484.2">This individual should have visibility into the incident to answer any questions. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.484.3">This is often the SOC manager or another responsible party.</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.485.1">Incident type</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.486.1">: In the escalation, it is important to identify the type of incident that is being escalated. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.486.2">This may dictate a specific type of response. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.486.3">Here is a list of incident types to consider: </span><ul><li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.487.1">Ransomware</span></li><li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.488.1">Malware infection</span></li><li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.489.1">External system compromise</span></li><li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.490.1">Ongoing compromise</span></li><li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.491.1">Data exfiltration</span></li><li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.492.1">C2</span></li><li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.493.1">DoS</span></li><li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.494.1">Other</span></li></ul></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.495.1">Incident severity</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.496.1">: This is the first assessment </span><a id="_idIndexMarker130"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.497.1">of the incident’s severity. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.497.2">Having an idea of the severity</span><a id="_idIndexMarker131"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.498.1"> of the issue will allow the IR team to align resources properly. </span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.499.1">The number of systems impacted</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.500.1">: If possible, it is important to provide an order of magnitude of the incident. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.500.2">This should include the number of systems, operating system type, and the function of the systems—for example, an incident that is impacting only Linux servers running Apache versus Windows desktops.</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.501.1">Patient Zero identified</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.502.1">: This data is not often included in the initial escalation, as Patient Zero—or the first system identified as compromised—is often located during the analysis phase of an incident. </span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.503.1">Tactics identified</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.504.1">: Any tactics that have been identified</span><a id="_idIndexMarker132"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.505.1"> should be escalated as well. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.505.2">For example, lateral movement tactics using </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.506.1">Server Message Block</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.507.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.508.1">SMB</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.509.1">) or </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.510.1">Remote Desktop Protocol</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.511.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.512.1">RDP</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.513.1">) should be escalated as they</span><a id="_idIndexMarker133"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.514.1"> indicate a larger network-wide security incident. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.514.2">A good rubric of tactics to use is the MITRE </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.515.1">Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.516.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.517.1">ATT&amp;CK</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.518.1">) framework, which will be</span><a id="_idIndexMarker134"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.519.1"> covered in a later chapter. </span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.520.1">Indicators of compromise (IOCs)</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.521.1">: Data points such as IP addresses, domain names, or file hashes related</span><a id="_idIndexMarker135"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.522.1"> to the initial detection should be passed up to be included as part of the analysis. </span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.523.1">Actions taken</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.524.1">: If any actions were taken, the reporting party or their colleagues should be recorded</span><a id="_idIndexMarker136"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.525.1"> as well. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.525.2">For example, if the reporting group has the ability to block the execution of code and was successfully able to block further execution of malware, this has a direct impact on the type of response the IR team will execute.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.526.1">There are a variety of methods </span><a id="_idIndexMarker137"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.527.1">that can be used to communicate this information</span><a id="_idIndexMarker138"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.528.1"> to the CSIRT. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.528.2">A ticketing system can be configured to automatically notify CSIRT personnel with a ticket containing pertinent escalation details. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.528.3">Another option is the use of an email template that is sent to specific CSIRT personnel that handles escalations. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.528.4">During an incident, all actions taken by the CSIRT and other personnel from the start of the incident should be documented and tracked.</span></p>
<p class="callout-heading"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.529.1">Information</span></p>
<p class="callout"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.530.1">For organizations</span><a id="_idIndexMarker139"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.531.1"> that have limited resources and experience a limited number of incidents per year, most IT ticketing systems are sufficient for tracking incidents. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.531.2">The drawback to this method is that these systems generally lack an IR focus and do not have additional features that are designed to support IR activities. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.531.3">Larger organizations that have a higher frequency of incidents may be best served by implementing a purpose-designed IR tracking system. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.531.4">These systems allow the integration of evidence collection and incident playbooks.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.532.1">CSIRT members will then take control. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.532.2">If they are able to contain malware to that single system and identify an infection vector, they will attempt to remove the malware and, barring that, have the system reimaged and redeployed. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.532.3">At that point, the incident has been successfully concluded. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.532.4">The CSIRT member can document the incident and close it out without having to engage any other resources.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.533.1">Another example where escalation moves further up into an all-out CSIRT response can start very simply with an audit of Active Directory credentials. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.533.2">In this case, a server administrator with access management responsibilities is conducting a semi-annual audit of administrator credentials. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.533.3">During the audit, they identify three new administrator user accounts that do not tie to any known access rights. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.533.4">After further digging, they determine that these user accounts were created within several hours of each other and were created over a weekend. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.533.5">The server administrator contacts the CSIRT for investigation.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.534.1">The CSIRT analyst looks</span><a id="_idIndexMarker140"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.535.1"> at the situation and determines that a compromise</span><a id="_idIndexMarker141"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.536.1"> may have happened. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.536.2">The CSIRT member directs the server administrator to check event logs for any logins using those administrator accounts. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.536.3">The server administrator identifies</span><a id="_idIndexMarker142"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.537.1"> two logins: one on a database server and another on a web server in the </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.538.1">demilitarized zone</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.539.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.540.1">DMZ</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.541.1">). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.541.2">The CSIRT analyst then directs the network administrator assigned to the CSIRT to examine network traffic between the SQL database and the web server. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.541.3">Also, based on the circumstances, the CSIRT analyst escalates this to the CSIRT coordinator and informs them of the situation. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.541.4">The CSIRT coordinator then begins the process of engaging other CSIRT core teams and technical support members to assist.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.542.1">After examining the network traffic, it is determined that an external threat actor has compromised both systems and is in the process of exfiltrating the customer database from the internal network. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.542.2">At this point, the CSIRT coordinator identifies this as a high-level incident and begins the process of bringing support personnel into a briefing. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.542.3">As this incident has involved the compromise of customer data, CSIRT support personnel—such as marketing or communications and legal—need to become involved. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.542.4">If more resources are required, the CSIRT coordinator will take the lead in making that decision.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.543.1">Escalation procedures are created to ensure that the appropriate individuals have the proper authority and training to call upon resources when needed. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.543.2">The escalation procedures should also address the involvement of other personnel outside the core CSIRT members, based on the severity of the incident. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.543.3">One of the critical functions of escalation procedures is to clearly</span><a id="_idIndexMarker143"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.544.1"> define which individuals have the authority</span><a id="_idIndexMarker144"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.545.1"> to declare anomalous activity in an incident. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.545.2">The escalation procedures should also address the involvement of other personnel outside core CSIRT members, based on the severity of the incident.</span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-25"><a id="_idTextAnchor024"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.546.1">Testing the IR framework</span></h1>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.547.1">So far, there have been a number </span><a id="_idIndexMarker145"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.548.1">of areas that have been addressed in terms of preparing for an incident. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.548.2">From an initial understanding of the process involved in IR, we moved through the creation of an IR plan and associated playbooks.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.549.1">Once a capability has been created, it should be run through a table-top exercise to flush out any gaps or deficiencies. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.549.2">This exercise should include a high-level incident scenario that involves the entire team and one of the associated playbooks. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.549.3">A report that details the results of the table-top exercise and any gaps, corrections, or modifications should also be prepared and forwarded to senior leadership. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.549.4">Once leadership has been informed and acknowledges that the CSIRT is ready to deploy, it is now operational.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.550.1">As the CSIRT becomes comfortable executing the plan under a structured scenario, they may want to try more complex testing measures. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.550.2">Another available option is the Red/Blue or Purple team exercise. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.550.3">This is where the CSIRT is tasked with responding to an authorized penetration test. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.550.4">Here, the team is able to execute against a live adversary and test the plans and playbooks. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.550.5">This significantly increases the value of the penetration test as it provides an insight into the security of the infrastructure as well as the ability of the organization to respond appropriately.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.551.1">Regardless of the makeup of the team, another key component of CSIRT deployment is the inclusion of regular training. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.551.2">For CSIRT core members, specific training on emerging threats, forensic techniques, and tools should be ongoing. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.551.3">This can be facilitated through third-party training providers or, if available, in-house training. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.551.4">The technical support members of the CSIRT should receive regular training on techniques and tools available.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.552.1">This is especially important if these members may be called upon during an incident to assist with evidence collection or remediation activities. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.552.2">Finally, other support members should be included in the annual test of the IR plan. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.552.3">Just as with an inaugural test, the organization should pick a high-level incident and work through it using a table-top exercise. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.552.4">Another option for the organization is to marry up the testing of their IR plan with a penetration test. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.552.5">If the organization is able to detect the presence of the penetration test, they have the ability to run through the first phases of the incident and craft a tabletop for the remaining portions.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.553.1">One final component of the ongoing maintenance of an IR plan is a complete annual review. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.553.2">This annual review is conducted to ensure that any changes in personnel, constituency, or mission that may impact other components of the plan are addressed. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.553.3">In addition to a review of the plan, a complete review of the playbooks is conducted as well. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.553.4">As threats change, it may be necessary to change existing playbooks or add new ones. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.553.5">CSIRT personnel</span><a id="_idIndexMarker146"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.554.1"> should also feel free to create a new playbook in the event of a new threat emerging. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.554.2">In this way, the CSIRT will be in a better position to address incidents that may impact their organization. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.554.3">Any major changes or additions should also trigger another table-top exercise to validate additional plans and playbooks.</span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-26"><a id="_idTextAnchor025"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.555.1">Summary</span></h1>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.556.1">Benjamin Franklin is quoted as saying: “</span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.557.1">By failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.558.1">.” </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.558.2">In many ways, this sentiment is quite accurate when it comes to organizations and the threat of cyber attacks. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.558.3">Preparing for a cyber attack is a critical function that must be taken as seriously as any other aspect of cybersecurity. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.558.4">Having a solid understanding of the IR process to build on this with an IR capability can provide organizations with a measure of preparation so that in the event of an incident, they can respond. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.558.5">Keep in mind as we move forward that forensic techniques, TI, and reverse engineering are there to assist an organization to get to the end—that is, back up and running.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.559.1">This chapter explored some of the preparation that goes into building an IR capability. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.559.2">Selecting a team, creating a plan, and building playbooks and escalation procedures allow a CSIRT to effectively address an incident. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.559.3">The CSIRT and associated plans give structure to the digital forensic techniques to be discussed.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.560.1">This discussion begins with the next chapter, where proper evidence handling and documentation is the critical first step in investigating an incident.</span></p>
