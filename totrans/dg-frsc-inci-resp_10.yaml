    forensic tasks associated with incident investigations often relied on methodologies
    that focused on evidence contained within the hard drive of a machine. Procedures
    dictated that the system should be powered down and the hard drive removed for
    imaging. While this methodology and the associated procedures were effective at
    ensuring the integrity of the evidence, this overlooked the wealth of information
    that was contained within the **Random Access Memory** (**RAM**), or memory for
    short, of the targeted system. As a result, incident response analysts began to
    focus a great deal of attention on ensuring that appropriate methods were employed
    that maintained the integrity of this evidence, as well as giving them a platform
    from which to obtain information of evidentiary value.

    the memory of a system, the tools and techniques available to incident response
    analysts, and, finally, how to analyze this information to obtain a clear understanding
    of how the system was compromised. In addition, these techniques can also be integrated
    into the analysis of other evidence, such as network log files and files located
    on the targeted system.

    The terms RAM and memory are used to describe the portion of the computer’s internal
    systems where the operating system places data utilized by applications and the
    system hardware while that application or hardware is in use. What makes RAM or
    memory different from storage is the volatile nature of the data. Often, if the
    system is shut down, the data will be lost.

    Mandiant Redline, is a GUI-based memory analysis tool that examines memory images
    for signs of rogue processes and scores them based on several factors. The second
    of these tools is Volatility, a command-line tool that allows analysts to drill
    into the details of the memory image and identify potentially malicious code.

    it is not malicious, the file associated with the code may still be. Depending

    of using Volatility in the command line is the ability to create scripts that
    automate the commands and output to text files. The drawback for analysts that
    are not used to working with Volatility and the command line is that they may
    need to continually reference commands or struggle with the correct syntax.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the previous section, the Volatility tools we looked at focused on those
    areas of the memory image that are mapped. If data is not mapped properly, these
    tools would be unable to extract the data and present it properly. This is one
    of the drawbacks of these tools for memory analysis. There is a good deal of data
    that will become unstructured and invisible to these tools. This could be the
    case when network connections are shut down or processes are exited. Even though
    they may not show up when the RAM is examined via Volatility, trace evidence will
    often still be present. Other evidence such as the pagefile also contains evidence
    that is unmapped and searchable.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One tool that is useful for extracting these traces is the Strings command,
    which is present in many Linux and Windows OSs. Strings allows a responder to
    search for human-readable strings of characters. Given a set of keywords or **Global
    Regular Expression Print** (**GREP)** commands, the responder may be able to extract
    additional relative data, even from RAM captures that may have been corrupted
    via malware or improper acquisitions.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This chapter discussed two major topic areas of memory analysis. First, we covered
    the available data points and the methodology that can be followed. In addition,
    several tools, such as Volatility, Volatility Workbench, and Strings, have been
    explored. In addition to an overview of these tools, several of their features
    have been explored. This only scratches the surface of the number of features
    each of these tools has to offer the incident response analyst. These tools, taken
    in conjunction with a methodology for analyzing system RAM, can give the analyst
    a powerful tool for determining if a system has been compromised. With malware
    becoming more advanced, including malware that executes entirely in RAM, analysts
    must incorporate memory analysis into their capabilities. Marrying these techniques
    with network evidence collection can provide analysts and their organizations
    with a powerful tool to identify and remediate an incident.
