- en: Various digital forensic examination models are in use, each emphasizing slightly
    different stages in the investigation process, with no universally agreed-upon
    model used by practitioners. I have examined the structure of each model and propose
    that a typical digital forensic examination may be divided into the evidence-recovery
    and preservation stage and then locating, sorting, selecting, and analyzing the
    evidence recovered that may support (or refute) a legal argument. The next stage
    is validating the evidence, ensuring that it is what it purports to be. The final
    stage is presenting the selected evidence in a formal report. This may be to the
    legal team or the investigator or may be made by the practitioner testifying during
    a legal hearing.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The examination is often an iterative process, in that the various stages may
    be revisited before the examination is finally concluded. For example, another
    device that may be recovered later will require data recovery and preservation
    of the data, as was described in detail in [Chapter 4](ch04.html "Chapter 4. Recovering
    and Preserving Digital Evidence"), *Recovering and Preserving Digital Evidence*.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Recovery and preservation has traditionally involved the imaging of devices
    and storing the data in bulk in a forensic file or, more securely, in a forensic
    image container, notably the ILookIX `.ASB` container. [Chapter 5](ch05.html "Chapter 5. The
    Need for Enhanced Forensic Tools"), *The Need for Enhanced Forensic Tools*, described
    the recovery of smaller, more manageable datasets from larger datasets from a
    device or network system using the ISeekDiscovery automaton. Whether the practitioner
    examines an image container or an extraction of information in the ISeekDiscovery
    `.ISK` container, it should be possible to overview the recovered information
    and develop a clearer perception of the type of evidence that should be located.
    Using a structured process to locate the evidence makes the certainty of locating
    it more likely and the process less arduous than using an unstructured approach.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once acquired, the image or device may be searched to find evidence. Locating
    evidence requires a degree of analysis combined with practitioner knowledge and
    experience. As outlined in [Chapter 2](ch02.html "Chapter 2. Hardware and Software
    Environments"), *Hardware and Software Environments*, evidence may be located
    in a broad range of devices and in various locations on those devices. Information
    of interest may be located in the e-mail folder, containing messages and attachments
    of interest to an investigator. The process of selection involves analysis, and
    as new leads open up, the search for more evidence intensifies until ultimately
    a thorough search process is completed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The searching process involves the analysis of possible evidence, from which
    evidence may be discarded, collected, or tagged for later re-examination, thereby
    instigating the selection process. It must be stressed that the selection of candidate
    evidence by the practitioner does not mean that it is proof of guilt or innocence—it
    simply means that the evidence selected appears to be relevant to and supportive
    of the matter at hand. This means that the evidence supports or adds to a legal
    argument or hypothesis—the ultimate *probandum* of a case, such as the defendant
    using the computer to strike the deceased's head, resulting in his demise! Some
    theorists and practitioners have a clearly defined stage in their models they
    call analysis, but that may be somewhat confusing as analysis is part of all stages
    and not really a separate process.

    examination of digital evidence in the investigative and legal domains. The penultimate
    stage of the investigative process is the validation of the evidence, aimed at
    determining its reliability, relevance, authenticity, accuracy, and completeness.
    The final stage is the presentation of the evidence to interested parties, such
    as the investigators, the legal team, and, ultimately, the legal adjudicating
    body. Evidence validation is covered in more detail in [Chapter 9](ch09.html "Chapter 9. Validating
    the Evidence"), *Validating the Evidence*. Once the legal process is completed,
    the digital evidence containers and digital devices may require safe storage pending
    the outcome of any review or legal appeal:'

    the available digital evidence, ensuring that they do not misinterpret the evidence
    and make imprudent presumptions without carefully cross-checking the information.

    the lowest-hanging fruit. This is referred to as cherry-picking and is selective,
    biased, and can sometimes lead to important evidence being located that may challenge
    other evidence. Any prosecutor worthy of presenting a case in court always looks
    for the weaknesses in the prosecution case, primarily as a strategy to deflect
    a counterattack. In the interest of justice, all evidence procured by the prosecution
    that has a bearing on a case must be shared with the other party. For the defense
    team, the requirement to reciprocate varies in different jurisdictions and is
    based on the adversarial court process of the prosecution having to prove that
    the defendant is guilty, not for the defendant to prove innocence.

    as to the nature of the transgression and possible suspects. The practitioner
    looks for data that supports or refutes hypotheses about the incident. Timestamps,
    for example, may be changed in most systems; therefore, it is helpful to locate
    log entries, network traffic, and other events internal and external to the suspect

    hypothesis from a groundless assertion—it may confirm or disprove a hypothesis.

    e-mail types supported in ILookIX. All e-mail client deconstructions become part
    of the same basic explorer e-mail concept. This removes the differences between
    clients so that functions such as **E-mail Linkage Analysis** can be used to analyze
    and explore in a new, much easier-to-use interface. This more easily deciphers
    complex e-mail relationships. It allows the deconstruction of e-mail during the
    wizard case load process, or it provides the option of deconstructing the pieces
    one at a time or in groups. Either way, the Interface provides an object model
    that encompasses all of the characteristics of an internet e-mail item using the
    RFC standards that apply to all Internet e-mail send/receive clients.

    take a few minutes. To make the analysis more readable, it is necessary to only
    select one or a few e-mail stores to analyze at a time when first using the tool.
    Once the analysis is displayed, the user will see the e-mail linkage itself. It
    is then possible to see a line between correspondents, indicating that they have
    a relationship of some type. Here, in particular, line thickness indicates the
    frequency of traffic between two correspondents; therefore, thicker flow lines
    indicate more traffic.

    the analysis is really simple, and one of the most immediately valuable resources
    this provides is group identification, as shown in the following screenshot. ILookIX
    will initiate a search for that addressee and list all e-mails where the selected
    addressee was a correspondent. Users may make their own connection lines by clicking
    on an addressee node point and dragging to another node point. Nodes can be deleted
    to allow linkage between smaller groups of individuals:'

    a service that creates point-in-time copies of files. The service is built in
    to versions of Windows Vista, 7, 8, and 10 and is turned on by default. ILookIX
    can recover true copies of overwritten files from shadow volumes, as long as they
    resided on the volume at the time the snapshot was created. VSS recovery is a
    method of recovering extant and deleted files from the volume snapshots available
    on the system. It is a valuable resource for locating previously unavailable data
    to assist an investigation, as illustrated in the case study at the end of this

    chart showing the key events and so on. Each of the major event nodes could be

    services to a range of mining exploration companies. The business had lost a number
    of its technical experts to a rival business and noticed a drop in in its market
    share. There was a suspicion that departing staff members may have stolen some
    proprietary knowledge and expertise, which they later shared with the competing
    business. A forensic examination of the business' server and the computer terminals
    used by the departed staff members was initiated to determine whether some form
    of industrial espionage or sabotage had occurred.

    to be a sound starting point, but examination only recovered details of their
    dissatisfaction and contempt for the business and plans to move to the competitor.

    the competing business, from which further leads could be developed.

    (compressed) file some 4 GB in size named `Calibration.rar` that appeared to be
