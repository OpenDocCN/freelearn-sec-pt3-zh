- en: Welcome to the world of digital forensics! In this book, you will be going into
    the depths of the Windows operating system to determine the user’s actions on
    the system. You will also learn about the different filesystems used by the Windows
    operating system. The role of the examiner is not only about the examination,
    but also about the report you generate and how you explain your findings. You
    will learn how to prepare for a digital investigation, including equipment selection,
    training, and planning a response to the crime scene. It is my hope that this
    book will be your resource if you are a novice examiner or an experienced examiner.

    about the various skills and tasks required to be a forensic examiner, completing
    forensic analyses in either criminal or civil matters. This book will deliver
    information through the lens of the author’s experience in the United States of
    America so references to criminal matters will involve American law.

- en: '*Chapter 1*, *Types of Computer-Based Investigations*, introduces to the reader
    the different topics of computer-based investigations, from criminal acts investigated
    by the police to potentially illegal actions performed by an employee or third
    parties and examined by a non-governmental investigator. While the goal is the
    same—to present evidence about an incident—the methods of the two slightly differ.
    It is essential for the reader to understand the similarities, that is, being
    able to present evidence in judicial proceedings, and recognize the differences,
    that is, search warrant requirements for a government agent.'

- en: '*Chapter 2*, *The Forensic Analysis Process*, details the critical thinking
    in the planning of providing digital investigative services. This topic will allow
    the reader to create a strategy to conduct an efficient investigation. The reader
    will learn to offer different approaches to conduct an investigation depending
    on the unique set of circumstances for each matter.'

- en: '*Chapter 3*, *Acquisition of Evidence*, explains that digital evidence is one
    of the most volatile pieces of evidence an investigator can handle. The mishandling
    of digital evidence can severely impact an investigation. Additionally, you may
    destroy the entire dataset. This chapter will address how to minimize or eliminate
    these issues when using a validation process to create a forensic image.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 4*, *Computer Systems*, explains that the investigator must control
    the computer processes while acquiring digital evidence. When dealing with the
    many combinations of operating systems and hardware, you must implement controls
    to protect the integrity of the evidence. This chapter will discuss the boot process
    in detail and identify the most commonly used filesystems.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 5*, *Computer Investigation Process*, explains that being a forensic
    examiner is much more than pushing a button. Once the evidence has been collected,
    you have to analyze the dataset. It is not about finding artifacts but rather
    examining the data and putting it into a context that will either support or not
    support the hypothesis about the user’s actions on the system.'

- en: '*Chapter 6*, *Windows Artifact Analysis*, explains that Microsoft Windows is
    by far the most common operating system today. In this chapter, we will look at
    the different versions of Windows and will show the reader how to identify and
    recover common artifacts based on the release of Windows being examined.'

- en: '*Chapter 7*, *RAM Memory Forensic Analysis*, covers the analysis of RAM, which
    is a source of evidence that has recently been recognized as containing vital
    information about the user’s actions on the system. RAM is very volatile evidence
    and can provide data that cannot be found anywhere else on the computer system.'

- en: '*Chapter 8*, *Email Forensics – Investigation Techniques*, discusses email,
    which is a part of everyday life. This communication vector can be one of the
    primary communication tools for the majority of the population. These communications
    can contain incredible amounts of data related to an investigation. The investigator
    must be able to reconstruct the path that email took from the source to the destination
    to determine its validity.'

- en: '*Chapter 9*, *Internet Artifacts*, explains that using the internet is a daily
    activity for the majority of the population. Like any other activity, the internet
    can be used for legal, law-abiding business, or for criminal activity. The internet
    can be accessed in a variety of ways. The forensic investigator must be able to
    analyze all these different aspects of the internet to get to the truth of the
    matter.'

- en: '*Chapter 10*, *Online Investigations*, discusses how to use open-source intelligence
    techniques to learn about the target of the investigations. Also discussed are
    the steps an investigator can take to hide their true identity and create an undercover
    online persona.'

- en: '*Chapter 11*, *Networking Basics*, explains some of the common network protocols,
    hardware and models that are being used to connect devices and share information.
    The ability to understand how information is shared between devices is a critical
    skill for the online investigator.'

- en: '*Chapter 12*, *Report Writing*, covers report writing, which is not the most
    exciting portion of the forensic exam process. The forensic examiner must be able
    to explain a technical topic to a non-technical user. As a forensic examiner,
    you must be able to place that artifact into a context that the audience understands.
    This ability is a critical skill that you need to master to be a competent forensic
    examiner.'

- en: '*Chapter 13*, *Expert Witness Ethics*, explains that a forensic examiner must
    be objective, truthful, honest, and perform their due diligence when conducting
    an examination. The examiner will be providing testimony that may result in someone
    losing their freedom. The ultimate goal of the investigation conducted by the
    forensic examiner is to provide testimony or evidence in a judicial or administrative
    proceeding to stop the cybercriminal’s activity.'
