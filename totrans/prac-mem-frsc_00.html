			<p>Memory forensics is a powerful analysis technique that could be used in different areas from incident response to malware analysis. For an experienced investigator, memory is an essential source of valuable data. Memory forensics not only provides key insights into the user's context and allows you to look for unique traces of malware, but also, in some cases, helps to piece together the puzzle of a sophisticated targeted attack. </p>
			<p>This book will introduce you to the concept of memory forensics and then gradually progress deep into more advanced concepts of hunting and investigating advanced malware using free tools and memory analysis frameworks. This book takes a practical approach and uses memory images from real incidents to help you get a better understanding of the subject so that you will be equipped with the skills required to investigate and respond to malware-related incidents and complex targeted attacks. This book touches on the topic of Windows, Linux, and macOS internals and covers concepts, techniques, and tools to detect, investigate, and hunt threats using memory forensics.</p>
			<p>By the end of this book, you will be well versed in memory forensics and will have gained hands-on experience of using various tools associated with it. You will be able to create and analyze memory dumps on your own, examine user activity, detect traces of fileless malware, and reconstruct the actions taken by threat actors.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-5"><a id="_idTextAnchor004"/>Who this book is for</h1>
			<p>This book is intended to be read by incident responders, digital forensic specialists, cybersecurity analysts, system administrators, malware analysts, students, and curious security professionals new to this field and interested in learning memory forensics. You are assumed to have a basic understanding of malware and its workings. Knowledge of operating system internals would be helpful but is not mandatory. Sufficient information will be provided to those new to this field.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"/>What this book covers</h1>
			<p><a href="B17056_01_Final_JM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor011"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a>, <em class="italic">Why Memory Forensics?</em>, explains why memory forensics is a vital part of many digital forensic examinations nowadays based on real-world examples, describing the main goals and investigation techniques used by DFIR specialists as well as discussing daily challenges they face.</p>
			<p><a href="B17056_02_Final_JM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor023"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>, <em class="italic">Acquisition Process</em>, familiarizes you with the basic techniques and tools used for memory acquisition, and the possible issues associated with this process. In addition, you will have the opportunity to compare live memory analysis with that of memory dumps by examining the pros and cons.</p>
			<p><a href="B17056_03_Final_JM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor041"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></a>, <em class="italic">Windows Memory Acquisition</em>, discusses Windows memory acquisition tools along with their approach to memory work. Some suggestions for choosing the right tool will be discussed as well as comprehensive examples.</p>
			<p><a href="B17056_04_Final_JM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor050"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></a>, <em class="italic">Reconstructing User Activity with Windows Memory Forensics</em>, looks at reconstructing user activity, which is essential for many cases since it gives a better understanding of what is going on. This chapter provides some insights into user action recovery techniques based not only on running processes and network connections but also on the analysis of the Windows registry and file system in memory.</p>
			<p><a href="B17056_05_Final_JM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor078"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></a>, <em class="italic">Malware Detection and Analysis with Windows Memory Forensics</em>, tackles how modern malware tends to leave as few traces as possible on the disk, which is why memory analysis is becoming a critical element of forensic investigation. In this chapter, we will explain how to search for traces of malicious software in process memory as well as in the Windows Registry, event logs, and file system artifacts in memory.</p>
			<p><a href="B17056_06_Final_JM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor105"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>, <em class="italic">Alternative Sources of Volatile Memory</em>, addresses the fact that, sometimes, it is impossible to create a memory dump for analysis, however, there is always a chance of finding some volatile memory on disk. This chapter introduces alternative sources of volatile data in Windows along with the tools and techniques for their analysis.</p>
			<p><a href="B17056_07_Final_JM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor118"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></a>, <em class="italic">Linux Memory Acquisition</em>, shows the core differences between Windows and Linux memory acquisition. Tools for Linux memory acquisition will be proposed along with their configuration and use cases.</p>
			<p><a href="B17056_08_Final_JM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor126"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></a>, <em class="italic">User Activity Reconstruction</em>, looks at how reconstructing user activity in Linux-based systems is a bit different from that in Windows. This chapter will give you several tricks for how to track user activity with Linux memory dumps.</p>
			<p><a href="B17056_09_Final_JM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor141"><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em></a>, <em class="italic">Malicious Activity Detection</em>, focuses on the techniques needed to search for malicious activity in Linux-based systems and analyze it.</p>
			<p><a href="B17056_10_Final_JM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor148"><em class="italic">Chapter 10</em></a>, <em class="italic">MacOS Memory Acquisition</em>, relates to the acquisition process, focusing on macOS memory acquisition tools and their use, so you will be able to create memory dumps from all popular operating systems.</p>
			<p><a href="B17056_11_Final_JM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor156"><em class="italic">Chapter 11</em></a>, <em class="italic">Malware Detection and Analysis with macOS Memory Forensics</em>, looks at techniques that allow us to get the data we need to track user actions and detect and analyze malicious activity in macOS memory.</p>
