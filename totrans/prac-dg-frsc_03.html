Its use in legal cases too has grown and shows no sign of diminishing. Digital evidence is derived from the examination of a wide range of digital devices and shares similar characteristics with other forms of evidence. There are some differences that enhance evidence recovery analysis, but, as will be seen in this book, there are characteristics that also make it challenging for practitioners.</p><p>This chapter defines and describes the special properties of digital evidence and its contribution to investigations. The topics specifically covered in this chapter will:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Define digital evidence and its use</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Explain the special properties of digital evidence, including its time and location metadata and file characteristics</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Highlight the technical complexities of digital evidence and challenges to sound analysis</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Explain the requirements for determining the admissibility of digital evidence</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Provide a sample case study to illustrate the nature of digital evidence and its value in legal cases</li></ul></div><div class="section" title="Defining digital evidence"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl1sec25"/>Defining digital evidence</h1></div></div></div><p>Digital evidence<a id="id182" class="indexterm"/> is information in digital form found on a wide range of computer devices; in fact, it is anything that has a microchip or has been processed by one and then stored on other media. Digital data is a numerical representation that is usually in binary form, as distinct from electronic data stored in analog form. It has been alleged that an Australian narcotics trafficker concealed a spreadsheet of his customers and transactions inside a microchip implanted in his pet dog. It was uncovered when a canny police officer queried the presence of a microchip implant gun, readily available online for a modest cost, in the suspect's premises. This discovery prompted minor surgery on the dog to remove the tag, which was later found to contain the incriminating information in the form of a spreadsheet containing a list of narcotics<a id="id183" class="indexterm"/> dealers and transactions.</p><p>Evidence tendered in legal cases, such as criminal trials, is classified as witness testimony or direct evidence, or indirect evidence in the form of an object, such as physical documents, the property owned by persons, and so forth. Evidence in electronic form, including digital and analog data, is defined as real evidence and sometimes as documentary evidence. It has also been referred to as IT evidence, electronic evidence, or computer evidence. Digital evidence includes e-mails, electronic documents, spreadsheets, databases, system logs, and audio, picture, and video files, amongst others. The most common form of evidence presented to courts is spoken word by practitioners when providing interpretations of digital evidence.</p><div class="section" title="The use of digital evidence"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec50"/>The use of digital evidence</h2></div></div></div><p>Evidence in legal cases is used to prove (or refute) facts that are in dispute as well as proving the<a id="id184" class="indexterm"/> plausibility of disputed facts—most notably, circumstantial evidence or indirect evidence. Digital evidence, just like documentary evidence, provides inferences that may assist in proving some key fact of the case. It helps investigators and legal teams develop reliable hypotheses or theories as to the perpetrator of a crime. Its usefulness is apparent in establishing a link between a crime, the victim, and the perpetrator of that crime. The reliability of the evidence is paramount to supporting or refuting any hypothesis put forward as to the involvement of possible suspects. We will look at this more in <a class="link" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Selecting and Analyzing Digital Evidence">Chapter 6</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Selecting and Analyzing Digital Evidence</em></span>.</p><p>Digital evidence can take many forms depending on the circumstances of each case and the devices from which the evidence is recovered. In the past, the most common recoveries have been from desktop and laptop computers and network servers. Digital evidence collected assists in both criminal and civil cases and, on occasion, may be the only evidence tendered. Recovery from desktop and laptop computers was generally performed by physically removing the hard drive from the source device and connecting it to the practitioner's computer. To prevent or minimize contamination of the suspect's source device, we can use a hardware device called a <span class="strong"><strong>write blocker</strong></span> on the suspect's device so as to copy data<a id="id185" class="indexterm"/> potentially holding evidence. The use of hardware and software write-blocking tools and processes is described in detail in <a class="link" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Recovering and Preserving Digital Evidence">Chapter 4</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Recovering and Preserving Digital Evidence</em></span>.</p><p>The imaging process is intended to copy all blocks of data from the suspect's to the practitioner's target device. This is sometimes referred to as a physical copy of all data, as distinct from a logical copy, which will only copy what a user would normally see. Logical copies do not capture all the data, and the process will alter some file metadata to the extent that its forensic value is greatly diminished, resulting in possible legal challenge by <a id="id186" class="indexterm"/>the opposing legal team. Therefore, a full bit-for-bit copy is the preferred forensic process. The file created on the target device is called a <a id="id187" class="indexterm"/>
<span class="strong"><strong>forensic image file</strong></span> and various formats are available, including <code class="literal">.AFF</code>, <code class="literal">.ASB</code>, <code class="literal">.E01</code>, and <code class="literal">.dd</code> or raw image files, and virtual image formats such as <code class="literal">.VMDK</code> and <code class="literal">.VDI</code>.</p><p>The following screenshot shows a <code class="literal">.ASB</code> forensic image container produced by IXImager, which contains an encrypted log and an image file:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04931_03_01.jpg" alt="The use of digital evidence"/><div class="caption"><p>An ASB container and log file</p></div></div><p>The benefit of being able to make an exact copy of the data is that it can be copied and the original device can be returned to the owner or stored for trial without normally having to be examined repeatedly. This reduces the likelihood of drive failure or evidence contamination. The following screenshot shows part of the log file of an imaging process. This may be presented during legal proceedings to confirm the nature and circumstances of the imaging undertaken by the practitioner:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04931_03_02.jpg" alt="The use of digital evidence"/><div class="caption"><p>The log file shows the period of imaging of a 250-GB drive</p></div></div><p>Special forensics<a id="id188" class="indexterm"/> tools are required to open and examine the data held in an image, and they do so without altering the image and contaminating the evidence, in the tradition of sound forensic practice. Unlike an organic or physical exhibit, such as a corpse or an oil painting, where biopsies of tissue and samples of canvas and paint are excised and usually destroyed during testing, a forensic image preserves all the data in pristine condition. It allows files of importance to be extracted and displayed using the forensic software, but it does not change the composition and integrity of the image or the files and metadata it contains.</p><p>Being able to examine files and folders from an image to reconstruct events of relevance requires a user-friendly interface. Looking at system files, navigating file directories, and opening cache folders to view browsing history are now supported by enhanced forensic software. The following screenshot shows a text file being viewed using ILookIX so that the contents <a id="id189" class="indexterm"/>may be viewed while deciding whether the file is relevant to the investigation:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04931_03_03.jpg" alt="The use of digital evidence"/><div class="caption"><p>View of a text file using ILookIX</p></div></div><p>The exact view of a file is shown in the following screenshot, which displays the <span class="strong"><strong>Properties</strong></span> sheet that provides a record of the file metadata, including timestamps and file location. This information may be useful in the reconstruction of a transgression or identifying a link to a perpetrator:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04931_03_04.jpg" alt="The use of digital evidence"/><div class="caption"><p>The Properties sheet of a file viewed using ILookIX</p></div></div><p>Similarly, recovering and viewing information from network server computers may be restricted because the organization may not want to stop its normal business, because each server<a id="id190" class="indexterm"/> or folder on a server may be imaged. To do so may be costly and time-consuming and not guaranteed to recover the sought-for evidence. The following figure shows a spreadsheet of search results of the ISeekDiscovery automaton deployed on a large dataset to recover files of potential value to an investigation without disrupting the functions of the network or contaminating the data:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04931_03_05.jpg" alt="The use of digital evidence"/><div class="caption"><p>The ISeekDiscovery automaton: search term hit statistics and corresponding recovered files</p></div></div><p>The following<a id="id191" class="indexterm"/> screenshot shows files of interest that have been selected for further analysis. This can be shared with the investigator and legal team for them to see whether the information is useful and should then be extracted:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04931_03_06.jpg" alt="The use of digital evidence"/><div class="caption"><p>File categories based on search terms for later analysis</p></div></div><p>Mobile phones and other handheld devices are not imaged in the same way as desktops. The hardware and interface of external devices such as a forensic computer are different. Let's use the iPhone as a good example: unless the password is known, the device cannot be accessed. Apple uses a series of encrypted sectors located on microchips, making it difficult to access the raw data inside the phone. Special software has been developed for the recovery and analysis of data from mobile phones, <span class="strong"><strong>global positioning system</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>GPS</strong></span>) devices, tablets, and <a id="id192" class="indexterm"/>remote phone modems.</p><p>This software <a id="id193" class="indexterm"/>connects the examiner's computer to the mobile device, which, through a series of user commands and some small changes to the settings on the device, allows the extraction of data. The software offers a logical extraction of the basic information on the device together with a record of the device characteristics and an extraction log. This enables a speedy triage of the data. Until recently, more detailed extraction of mobile phones was possible, permitting an extraction or a dump of much more of the device data in what was termed a physical extraction. The iPhone model 4S onward no longer enables physical extractions. More recent versions of Android devices similarly prevent more than a backup being taken of the device and no longer allow physical dumps to be recovered. The attached SIM card and any data-storage SD card can also be examined by these applications.</p><p>Leading software applications, such as Cellebrite and Microsystemation's XRY kits, create a proprietary evidence container of the device data that is recovered including extraction logs. The container can only be read by the software but does allow extractions and exports of files for further analysis. The software user interface is now refined and facilitates quicker analysis and report production, especially in larger investigations involving a greater number of devices.</p><p>The following screenshot shows an example of a physical extraction case summary in the XRY viewer screen. In this example, in an earlier Android version (2.3.4), it was possible to make a physical extraction of important evidence of browsing activities. This extra evidence provided the defendant the opportunity to prove his innocence of serious criminal charges. Recent testing by my fellow researchers shows that a considerable amount of data exists that is not captured by conventional extraction software:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04931_03_07.jpg" alt="The use of digital evidence"/><div class="caption"><p>An XRY case summary view of a physical extraction of a Samsung GT-S7500l Galaxy Ace Plus</p></div></div><p>However, while <a id="id194" class="indexterm"/>connecting to the device, care must be taken to ensure that it does not connect to a mobile network, local Wi-Fi, or Bluetooth devices in the proximity. SIM cards are removed and may be examined separately to protect contamination to the phone by inadvertent local connections. There are numerous cases where mobile phones have been remotely reset to factory default mode, thereby wiping any data needed for examination. Remote-wiping applications, intended to allow phone owners to wipe private data on their phones in the event of theft or loss, are now used by those wishing to frustrate investigators from accessing potential evidence.</p><p>Unlike laptops and desktop computers, mobile phones are not fully write-block protected by forensic software and tools during data recovery. Small-sized programs are often installed on them to assist in the extraction process. This has the potential to contaminate and overwrite some space on the device, which, while not ideal, is unavoidable. <a class="link" href="ch08.html" title="Chapter 8. Examining Browsers, E-mails, Messaging Systems, and Mobile Phones">Chapter 8</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Examining Browsers, E-mails, Messaging Systems, and Mobile Phones</em></span> will describe in more<a id="id195" class="indexterm"/> detail mobile phone forensics and the challenges it is presently posing to practitioners because of enhanced encryption.</p></div></div></div>
<div class="section" title="The special characteristics of digital evidence"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl1sec26"/>The special characteristics of digital evidence</h1></div></div></div><p>It will perhaps be<a id="id196" class="indexterm"/> useful for you to get some explanation as to what the courts consider to be acceptable and unacceptable evidence. There are different categories of evidence tendered in legal proceedings. The most common is <a id="id197" class="indexterm"/>
<span class="strong"><strong>direct evidence</strong></span>, sometimes called <span class="strong"><strong>witness</strong></span> or <span class="strong"><strong>testimonial</strong></span> evidence. This is<a id="id198" class="indexterm"/> evidence of events observed by the <a id="id199" class="indexterm"/>witness and depends on the credibility of the witness in terms of the reliability of the witness's memory, honesty, objectivity, and so on. Such witness testimony may be challenged and refuted, but it often goes a long way in establishing the truth of a matter before the court.</p><p>Human testimony must be based on human observation—an <span class="strong"><strong>eyewitness</strong></span> account, as it is often called. It may be something the witness directly heard, felt, smelled, tasted, or touched, but it must not be <a id="id200" class="indexterm"/>
<span class="strong"><strong>hearsay evidence</strong></span> or layperson opinion. Hearsay evidence is any matter relevant to a case that a witness has not observed personally through the five senses.</p><p>Courts have strict rules regarding hearsay and normally will disallow evidence that has not been directly observed by the witness. For example, if a police officer is informed by a witness of an offense that has taken place and apprehends the perpetrator, the officer cannot provide evidence of what the witness observed and has made a claim about. Such evidence from the officer would be rejected as it would be considered unreliable. The witness may tell the court what was observed, not the officer. Courts do not consider hearsay to be credible, particularly as the courts are denied the ability to cross-examine for determining witness credibility.</p><p>There are exceptions to the rule, which are made by court practice, <span class="strong"><strong>legislation</strong></span>, and <span class="strong"><strong>case law</strong></span>. Opinion, for example, may be tendered as expert and scientific opinion, which will be discussed in greater detail in <a class="link" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Selecting and Analyzing Digital Evidence">Chapter 6</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Selecting and Analyzing Digital Evidence</em></span>.</p><div class="section" title="The circumstantial nature of digital evidence"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec51"/>The circumstantial nature of digital evidence</h2></div></div></div><p>Unlike<a id="id201" class="indexterm"/> evidence tendered by a human witness, which must be based on what was observed by the witness, <span class="strong"><strong>indirect evidence</strong></span>, such as <a id="id202" class="indexterm"/>digital evidence, is considered to be hearsay. Indirect evidence, including digital evidence, is considered to be circumstantial evidence and may be categorized in the same way as, for example, a physical document such as ink on paper.</p><p>In theory, because the truthfulness of digital evidence is difficult to validate, it is inadmissible in a range of criminal cases in jurisdictions based on English law. Nowadays, however, its admission is discretionary in criminal cases. This has raised claims that such leniency runs contrary to the interests of justice.</p><p>Digital information stored in electronic databases and audit logs, for example, is computer-generated and does not always contain information generated by human users. Such information has been challenged in some earlier legal trials, but it has been successfully argued that these records may be admissible subject to certain assurances as to the reliability and accuracy of the computer that created and recorded the information. Courts also require some proof that the creation and storage of these records are part of the organization's business activities. The automated digital recording of speeding vehicles by<a id="id203" class="indexterm"/> radar detectors has been accepted as admissible evidence in courts for several decades, although its reliability has been challenged with some limited success.</p><p>Human testimony is not infallible and is sometimes found to be false, misleading, or just plain wrong. Circumstantial evidence has no voice and so inferences may be taken from it in an attempt to help prove some key fact. In this regard, inferences drawn from digital evidence are now commonly used to prove some key fact in a case, much in the same way as a knife found at a murder scene is tested for DNA and fingerprints to identify the suspect.</p><p>However, by its very nature, circumstantial evidence is probabilistic in nature, and that makes it challenging when trying to reconstruct a case. Digital evidence and documentary evidence are subject to the same degree of legal scrutiny. They are typically used as exhibits in a trial as supporting evidence in tandem with other evidence forming the combined testimony for the presenting party. Digital evidence is now more acceptable in courts because of its perceived similarity with physical documents.</p><p>The role of digital forensic practitioners is important as they explain the evidence and interpret its meaning through scientific explanation and opinion. They in effect interpret meaning from the evidence to assist the court in understanding the nature of the evidence and what inferences may be drawn from it. Ideally, documentary evidence is not submitted in isolation but corroborates or is corroborated by other related evidence that enhances its admissibility and reliability. The seasoned practitioner will look for extraneous evidence that assists in placing the evidence in the context of its creation and of those involved in events relating to the case.</p><p>It is interesting to note that the US Federal Rules of Evidence exclude statements of the state of mind or<a id="id204" class="indexterm"/> condition of witnesses from the hearsay rule. Rule 803(3) (<a class="ulink" href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rule_803">https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rule_803</a>) provides for the admissibility of "a statement of the declarant's then existing state of mind, emotion, sensation, or physical condition (such as intent, plan, motive, design, mental feeling, pain, and bodily health), but not including a statement of memory or belief to prove the fact remembered or believed unless it relates to the execution, revocation, identification, or terms of declarant's will."</p><p>This important exception is useful in admitting e-mails and social networking websites, which, despite the apparent informality of their communication, often contain candid expressions<a id="id205" class="indexterm"/> of a writer's state of mind. It is a commonly accepted principle in other jurisdictions, although proving criminal intent must be undertaken in the context of proof beyond reasonable doubt and not 100-percent certainty.</p></div><div class="section" title="File metadata and correlation with other evidence"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec52"/>File metadata and correlation with other evidence</h2></div></div></div><p>Digital evidence is quite often easy to locate and process and may contain useful metadata that<a id="id206" class="indexterm"/> can provide important proof of past events. Many <a id="id207" class="indexterm"/>commentators consider it superior to other forms of evidence. Files recovered as digital evidence contain useful antecedents in the form of file content and metadata as to their history in terms of their creation, modification, and last accessed timestamps. The location and name of the file often remains on the computer, as does some information as to when it was last opened and viewed. Such information can be most helpful in reconstructing past events relevant to an investigation and is frequently present in digital evidence.</p><p>File metadata is stored in a broad range of applications. Windows Registry, for example, records standard peripheral devices attached to the computer, such as hard drives, monitors, keyboards, and printers. The following screenshot shows a record of a USB device attached to the computer and a record of the last modified timestamp and the type and serial number of the USB device:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04931_03_08.jpg" alt="File metadata and correlation with other evidence"/><div class="caption"><p>Windows Registry showing a record of an attached USB device</p></div></div><p>Link files showing details of recent files accessed by users are scattered around a computer. They are useful to see what applications were recently accessed and the identity of the file being accessed. This can be most useful information when reconstructing a time line of key events. Link files and jump lists are helpful in this regard and can provide file location and timestamp metadata, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04931_03_09.jpg" alt="File metadata and correlation with other evidence"/><div class="caption"><p>List of link files recovered</p></div></div><p>Knowing <a id="id208" class="indexterm"/>where a user has been browsing can also be insightful <a id="id209" class="indexterm"/>in crime reconstruction. Cookie files are commonly stored on computers. These are small text files that are created by each website visited by a user and are stored on the computer. A list of cookie files recovered from a computer is illustrated in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04931_03_10.jpg" alt="File metadata and correlation with other evidence"/><div class="caption"><p>A list of recovered cookie files</p></div></div><p>Internet browsers typically store details of websites visited and these persist in cached files that <a id="id210" class="indexterm"/>may be recovered, as shown in the following <a id="id211" class="indexterm"/>screenshot. However, if the user has disabled browser history, this data may not be recorded:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04931_03_11.jpg" alt="File metadata and correlation with other evidence"/><div class="caption"><p>Recovered cached browser files</p></div></div><p>Even more helpful, the icing on the cake if you like, is information recovered from search history stores that show records of user searches made in browsers. This is shown in the following screenshot, which is rich in timestamps and search terms used. Remember that this information has been recovered from a forensic image and not through the process of booting up the computer to look through the browser history to view the information. That, of course, would probably contaminate the records and most likely only recover some of the data.</p><p>Other data may not be so easy to recover and would require a forensic tool to recover the additional datasets. It is possible to convert the forensic image to a bootable virtual drive to simulate the operation of the computer in logical or normal viewing or access mode and avoid contaminating the original image:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04931_03_12.jpg" alt="File metadata and correlation with other evidence"/><div class="caption"><p>Recovered database files containing search term histories</p></div></div><p>Many software <a id="id212" class="indexterm"/>applications record data in their application logs. Multimedia players have this feature as a default setting, as shown in the following screenshot. These logs coupled with most recently viewed link files can be used to reproduce parts of a time line relevant to the investigation:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04931_03_13.jpg" alt="File metadata and correlation with other evidence"/><div class="caption"><p>Recently viewed files recorded in VLC media player</p></div></div><p>Virtual machine <a id="id213" class="indexterm"/>applications such as TightVNC can be accessed through the <code class="literal">ProgramData</code> folder, as shown in the following diagram.

<div class="section" title="The technical complexities of digital evidence"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl1sec27"/>The technical complexities of digital evidence</h1></div></div></div><p>This section <a id="id217" class="indexterm"/>outlines the technical complexities<a id="id218" class="indexterm"/> of digital evidence and challenges to sound analysis. Like any form of indirect evidence, there are challenges to understanding more complex evidence artifacts recovered from a crime scene. Because of the technical complexity of digital evidence and its environment, some experience and specialized knowledge is required. Now that we have looked at examples of just how useful file and metadata information can be to the practitioner, understanding clearly and more fully the nature of digital information is vital. This section will introduce some challenges in using and analyzing digital evidence that show that digital forensics, which often provides such important material, is not a walk in the park.</p><p>Well before <a id="id219" class="indexterm"/>the emergence of electronic and digital data, it <a id="id220" class="indexterm"/>was difficult to forge and alter physical documents compared with digital data because of security measures protecting valuable documents and the special skills required to alter ink or pencil on paper. However, it should be noted that nowadays more than 90 percent of documents are stored in digital format. This creates significant difficulties in detecting any alteration to the data, requiring practitioners to link transgressors to initiating events or to some conclusive statement through an unambiguous trail of evidence. This sounds fine in theory, but often pieces of evidence are missing or erased and a complete chain of evidence is not always available. The file metadata may be present, but linking suspects to events through metadata that identifies the person who created the event is fraught with difficulty.</p><p>The most important requirement in any examination is to link the suspect to the events relating to, or associated with, a transgression. The lack of vigorous scientific processes for linking transgressors is further complicated by the rise in anonymous attacks on victims' computers and networks through various remote attacks. It can be a formidable prospect for practitioners to be aware of such exploitation, let alone trace the identities of transgressors. Even when the location of attackers is traced, they are often based in countries where the authorities provide a safe refuge for them. Extradition treaties, where they exist, do not always facilitate their speedy and economic apprehension.</p><div class="section" title="The malleability of digital evidence"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec53"/>The malleability of digital evidence</h2></div></div></div><p>The relative<a id="id221" class="indexterm"/> ease with which digital evidence can be contaminated cannot be overstated, and this is highlighted in the case study at the end of this chapter. During any forensic recovery of potential evidence, great care must be taken to avoid contamination of the evidence and particularly the crime scene. Depending on the crime scene, different agents may be present that can destroy or at least alter evidence. Animal and insect scavengers, the elements, and earth disturbance can all affect the composition of a corpse. This may make it difficult to identify the body and estimate the time and cause of death.</p><p>Similarly, electronic data may be easily altered, damaged, or erased through improper handling, even by the well-intentioned. Switching on a digital device will launch the operating system and various applications linked to the startup system. Switching off a device will erase the RAM and, worse still, may make it impossible to regain later access if the device is password protected and encrypted. Forensic tools are required to connect and gain access to the data stored on the device. The tools must prevent, or at the very least minimize, contamination to stored data. <a class="link" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Recovering and Preserving Digital Evidence">Chapter 4</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Recovering and Preserving Digital Evidence</em></span>, describes in detail the processes and forensic tools used to minimize evidence contamination.</p><p>Digital <a id="id222" class="indexterm"/>evidence may be modified to remove all traces of its existence on computing devices, and evidence of such modification may not always be possible to identify. It requires considerable effort and expertise by an examiner and a high degree of luck or advanced data carving that may recover some filenames and content traces or metadata that show the previous existence of a file or software used to remove or modify it. As mentioned in <a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Hardware and Software Environments">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Hardware and Software Environments</em></span>, thumbnail <code class="literal">.db</code> files are an example of this and show the previous existence of multimedia files on a computer.</p></div><div class="section" title="Metadata should not be taken at face value"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec54"/>Metadata should not be taken at face value</h2></div></div></div><p>Metadata<a id="id223" class="indexterm"/> shows the various stages of the history of a file. Most commonly, it shows the creation date when the file came into existence in the folder on the device. In the case of a text document creation, the creation date, the date the file was modified, and the last accessed date would be identical, as shown in the following table:</p><div class="informaltable"><table border="1"><colgroup><col style="text-align: left"/><col style="text-align: left"/><col style="text-align: left"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th style="text-align: left" valign="bottom">

<a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Hardware and Software Environments">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Hardware and Software Environments</em></span> described the process of file deletion and its <a id="id227" class="indexterm"/>degradation and eventual erasure through system operation. This results in many files being partly stored in the unallocated area of the hard drive. Traditionally, these fragments of files could only be located and carved out manually using a hex editor able to identify file headers, footers, and segments held in the image. The filesystem allocation information is not usually available to locate and examine these files, hence the need for a labor-intensive and challenging operation for the practitioner. However, file carving remains a vital process used in many cases where the recovery of suspected deleted files from an important part of an investigation is required.</p><p>Leading forensic tools such as ILookIX allow the practitioner to locate blocks and sectors on the hard drive thought to contain deleted information of importance. By manually looking at the disk through the <span class="strong"><strong>Disk View</strong></span> component, as shown in the following screenshot, unallocated space can be viewed to see whether any data is stored there. In this view, the red blocks denote system files, the yellows show folder structures, greens indicate<a id="id228" class="indexterm"/> sectors allocated to a file, blues are free space, and greys (not shown) indicate unused space:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04931_03_16.jpg" alt="Recovering files from unallocated space (data carving)"/><div class="caption"><p>Disk View showing free space, unallocated space with data, and data-occupied space</p></div></div><p>The ILookIX hex editor allows the data on selected sectors to be viewed in hexadecimal and readable text as shown in the two columns in the following screenshot. Using this tool, the start and end of file segments can be selected and used in an attempt to reconstruct or partially rebuild the file:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04931_03_17.jpg" alt="Recovering files from unallocated space (data carving)"/><div class="caption"><p>The ILookIX hex editor showing file data in hexadecimal and readable text</p></div></div><p>Obviously, this <a id="id229" class="indexterm"/>manual process is time-consuming as many filesystems contain millions of deleted files and file fragments, and automated systems have now replaced manual file carving to a large extent. ILookIX will recover and salvage deleted data, allowing the user to index this recovered data, as shown here:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04931_03_18.jpg" alt="Recovering files from unallocated space (data carving)"/><div class="caption"><p>Indexing all unallocated blocks on a forensic image</p></div></div><p>This <a id="id230" class="indexterm"/>process will create an index of the data in all of the blocks not currently assigned to any file, facilitating near-instant searching of unallocated blocks. Indexing unallocated blocks can take a considerable amount of time to run and may not be useful for most cases. Indexing Mac OS unallocated blocks is not worth the time because of the compression the operating system uses. Like other search term queries for file, e-mail, and registry hits or traces, searching through unallocated space can be effected as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04931_03_19.jpg" alt="Recovering files from unallocated space (data carving)"/><div class="caption"><p>Results for search terms including unallocated space</p></div></div></div><div class="section" title="Date and time problems"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec56"/>Date and time problems</h2></div></div></div><p>During any <a id="id231" class="indexterm"/>digital evidence analysis, the reliability of the file timestamps is critical in making a valid reconstruction of key events. The timestamps on all digital devices are an automated system that can often be adjusted manually. Laptop and desktop computers, for example, need to have the computer clock set when the device is first commissioned for use. Computer clocks are notoriously unreliable at sound timekeeping and require automatic<a id="id232" class="indexterm"/> synchronization with a reliable online service such as the <span class="strong"><strong>National Institute of Standards and Technology</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>NIST</strong></span>). If the device has not been used for some time or there is no automatic synchronization, then it is more than likely that the computer clock has been running slow or fast. This discrepancy can increase exponentially and make the logs of file events unreliable. Some clocks may be running an hour faster or slower and, in some cases, this may be in terms of days or even years.</p><p>Users may also set the device to the local time zone, or the time zone may change in the instance of a traveler taking a laptop through various time zones where the device may have been subject to change. In Windows Registry, a record is kept as to whether automatic time synchronization is active or not and when the previous (last) time zone and clock settings were adjusted.</p><p>Some filesystems store all of the date/time information in <span class="strong"><strong>Coordinated Universal Time</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>UTC</strong></span>). Others<a id="id233" class="indexterm"/> use the local time zone of the location wherein the mapped image originated. The origin time zone is the time zone used by the filesystem: it may be UTC or it may be another time zone. Even if the user has selected a specific time zone, Windows Registry will record the time zone as UTC or Zulu time or GMT+0. This must be acknowledged when interpreting timestamps in Registry as distinct from the general file folders shown in the Windows directory.</p><p>To emphasize the point, the view of Windows Registry shown in the following screenshot relates to a search for USB devices connected to the suspect's desktop computer. These timestamps were recorded as UTC and not UTC=8, the local time zone. This is just simply how Registry records information, and it can trap the unwary:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04931_03_20.jpg" alt="Date and time problems"/><div class="caption"><p>Windows Registry timestamps showing UTC time</p></div></div><p>Later <a id="id234" class="indexterm"/>chapters will look at file analysis in much more detail.

<div class="section" title="Determining the value and admissibility of digital evidence"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl1sec29"/>Determining the value and admissibility of digital evidence</h1></div></div></div><p>If digital evidence<a id="id235" class="indexterm"/> is being contemplated for inclusion during<a id="id236" class="indexterm"/> legal hearings, it must meet a number of conditions and the high expectations of the court. It must have some probative value in that it adds to the chain of evidence that supports the criminal or civil case. Before the evidence tendering occurs, it must comply with some mandatory conditions as to its admissibility. If it fails any of these conditions, then it is likely to be deemed by the court as inadmissible and not admitted as evidence, preventing the judge or jury from examining and deliberating upon it.</p><p>In most jurisdictions, legislation and common law govern the admissibility of evidence. Some jurisdictions are far less prescriptive than others, such as the USA, relying heavily on magistrates<a id="id237" class="indexterm"/> or judges to analyze the circumstances<a id="id238" class="indexterm"/> surrounding the admissibility of digital evidence. Special forensic expertise is normally required to locate, analyze, and determine the admissibility of digital evidence, and it often goes unchallenged when it really should be scrutinized more thoroughly. Increasingly, courts have agonized over the admissibility of digital evidence, as legal disputes may arise that diminish its usefulness.</p><p>Inquisitorial systems are common in a number of different jurisdictions, such as France, Germany, and other European states; parts of Africa; South America; and a range of Asian countries. The inquisitorial system is based on earlier Catholic inquisitions and is constructed to seek the truth of the matter at hand by thorough investigation and examination of all evidence. It is an alternative model to the more recently adopted adversarial system used in common law countries such as the United Kingdom, Australasian countries, and North America. Critics of the adversarial system claim that it seeks the truth through competition between the prosecution and the defense to present the most compelling arguments, all of which can obscure the search for the actual truth. Both systems offer sound remedies for justice and now share many similar features, with the advent of hybrid justice systems combining features of each model appearing in recent decades.</p><p>The following subsections outline the value or evidentiary worth of evidence, its admissibility, and how legal conventions apply specifically to digital evidence.</p><div class="section" title="Explaining the evidentiary weight of digital evidence"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec57"/>Explaining the evidentiary weight of digital evidence</h2></div></div></div><p>The value <a id="id239" class="indexterm"/>of evidence recovered from a crime scene is based on its relevance to other evidence available in support of some ultimate conclusion as to the identity and culpability of a suspect or suspects. The information considered of evidentiary value must be plausible and relevant to the matter at hand, that is, it is plausible and reasonable, has some bearing on the case, and adds to the collection of information from which inferences as to the guilt or complicity of suspects may be drawn.</p><p>It is the responsibility of judges and juries to evaluate the weight of the evidence to determine the defendant's guilt or innocence. It is explicitly not the role of the practitioner to comment on the defendant's culpability. However, the practitioner, who is probably the first to identify information that has some bearing on the case under investigation, must make a valued judgment as to the actual relevance of information located to the case. This is just as important in digital evidence examinations, where it is the practitioner who may initially be the only person to locate relevant evidence and understand its significance.</p><p>The practitioner<a id="id240" class="indexterm"/> may often be working to a specific brief to locate evidence, such as in a fraud investigation, and would have some idea of the nature of the offense and the type of evidence that supports a prosecution. Legal argument and debate may occur over the strength of the inferences that may be drawn from the evidence. Challenges will normally ensue when it appears the evidence may be misinterpreted or is unreliable.</p><p>To strengthen the weight of a case, sufficient evidence is required to prove or disprove the elements of the matter. Obviously, any evidence rendered inadmissible will degrade the overall stature of the case and could lead to its collapse. Many cases do not go to trial because the weight of the evidence is tenuous and lacking corroboration and any certain proof of linkage to the suspect may be uncertain.</p><p>Issues with the admissibility of the evidence may also prevent many guilty suspects from facing their day in court. However, before the weight of the evidence may be deduced by the court, it has to be admissible. We will look at this in some in detail in the next subsection.</p></div><div class="section" title="Understanding the admissibility of digital evidence"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec58"/>Understanding the admissibility of digital evidence</h2></div></div></div><p>Disputes over <a id="id241" class="indexterm"/>whether evidence is admissible are not uncommon; yet, in cases where digital evidence is tendered, there seems to be an unwillingness to contest digital exhibits when in fact there may well be strong grounds for doing so. This may be due to the newness of digital evidence and the legal fraternity's uncertainty in handling cases of a technical nature. A lack of understanding by lawyers of digital evidence, especially when viewing exhibits that may be technically complex, may also contribute to them failing to understand whether this new type of evidence is admissible or not. In practice, it is the judge's right to evaluate the admissibility of a digital document; however, this may sometimes be passed on to the jury to deliberate during the actual trial.</p><p>It is the role of the practitioner to advise the investigative or legal teams as to the admissibility of digital evidence. Because of the increasing complexity of technical evidence and the length of time it takes to run these costly court cases involving this type of evidence, there may occur a trial within a trial in the presence of a judge and absence of the jury. The hearings consist of the experts from opposing sides in the case presenting technical evidence and expert opinion. These trials are<a id="id242" class="indexterm"/> called <span class="strong"><strong>voir dire</strong></span> hearings, sometime<a id="id243" class="indexterm"/> jokingly called <span class="strong"><strong>hot-tubbing</strong></span> hearings. It allows the court to hear arguments from both sides and make a ruling as to the admissibility of the evidence without confusing and possibly creating bias in the mind of jurors.</p><p>The weight <a id="id244" class="indexterm"/>of evidence is normally not defined by legislation, but the admissibility is, and evidence must meet court guidelines and practices in various legal jurisdictions. Admissibility of evidence requires that the evidence be acquired lawfully, be relevant in that it proves or disproves some part of a case, and be reliable.</p></div><div class="section" title="Defining the lawful acquisition of digital evidence"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec59"/>Defining the lawful acquisition of digital evidence</h2></div></div></div><p>The first rule requires the party presenting the evidence to provide assurance that it was obtained lawfully. Now, this may simply be a matter of the owner or custodian of the evidence<a id="id245" class="indexterm"/> having provided free and unhindered access to the evidence and permitted it to be taken, or imaged in the case of digital evidence, for use in legal proceedings. Some written authority from the owner to that effect would normally be acquired.</p><p>Lawful acquisition may be covered under relevant legislation, empowering law enforcement officers to gain access to premises and seize computer devices suspected of containing evidence. This could be a customs officer at an airport examining a computer and having some reason to suspect that there is incriminating evidence stored on the device. The powers of seizure of suspected objects are provided by the specific legislation governing the agency, and no search warrant is required.</p><p>A search and seizure warrant issued by a magistrate or judge is the other option law enforcement agencies have. A warrant specifies the reason for its issue, the place where it may be served, the persons to whom it relates, and the type of objects that may be seized.</p><p>Practitioners must have a sound understanding of the legal issues involved regarding what constitutes legal seizure of computing devices, including mobile phones, as well as the data that may become evidence located on the devices and on computer networks. Practitioners should always consider that the evidence may well be required for legal hearings in the future, notwithstanding the original circumstances and purpose of the acquisition of digital evidence, which may not originally have been intended for use in legal proceedings. Consequently, practitioners' understanding and compliance with legislation covering the acquisition of the evidence is important.</p><p>The seizure of mobile phones during the arrest of suspects and searches of their homes and vehicles has recently presented some problems for law enforcement officers in the United States. Recent US Supreme Court rulings impose requirements, irrespective of whether the phones were seized during a general search warrant or under an agency's seizure powers, requiring that a separate search warrant be obtained to examine the seized phone. A 30-day stipulation may also be imposed, requiring the agency to provide evidence obtained within that period. This has caused some concerns that mobile phones, which in themselves are becoming increasingly difficult to obtain forensic images from, and the backlog in criminal cases stretching police resources may make it untenable in the future to examine mobile phones unless in exceptional cases and emergencies.</p><p>While this <a id="id246" class="indexterm"/>may frustrate investigations and displease practitioners, it does require them to have sufficient training, policy, and technology for the proper handling of mobile-device evidence. Sound professional development that enhances the effectiveness of law enforcement agencies in digital evidence collecting can only enhance the admissibility of digital evidence in criminal proceedings.</p><p>If, in the execution of a warrant, action by the officers goes beyond what has been stipulated, or the warrant was obtained after the seizure of evidence artifacts, many jurisdictions will suppress the evidence, thereby rendering it inadmissible under normal circumstances. However, in some jurisdictions, such as in the United States, if other untainted evidence exists supporting the case, the defendant may be convicted on the strength of the suppressed evidence.</p></div><div class="section" title="Emphasizing the importance of relevance in terms of digital evidence"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec60"/>Emphasizing the importance of relevance in terms of digital evidence</h2></div></div></div><p>While varying<a id="id247" class="indexterm"/> somewhat in different jurisdictions, the relevance of digital evidence is assessed by courts in the same way as other forms of circumstantial evidence. Various court standards and case law generally expect that evidence be relevant, not be hearsay, and not be overly prejudicial. Accordingly, courts may require practitioners to explain the complexity of the creation and storage of digital evidence in terms of the relevance of the evidence presented.</p><p>Relevance as well as the plausibility of the evidence is also a matter for the jury to deliberate upon in terms of the weight that may be inferred from each evidence exhibit. Because of the technical complexity of digital evidence, judges have difficulty in determining whether to admit the evidence based on what they believe its relevance is. It is not uncommon for an overzealous or inexperienced practitioner to misinterpret or overinterpret evidence to suit the particular argument or hypothesis.</p><p>The evidence must pass some form of logical relevance test, which is not overly onerous, as a court's determination of logical relevance is reviewed under a test applied to digital evidence, in much the same way as it would apply to more traditional evidence forms. The relevance test of digital evidence is intuitive and dismisses the view that digital evidence possesses some fundamentally mystic logical relevance.</p></div><div class="section" title="Outlining the reliability of digital evidence"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec61"/>Outlining the reliability of digital evidence</h2></div></div></div><p>In attempting<a id="id248" class="indexterm"/> to define the reliability of digital evidence, a number of adjectives spring to mind as there is no universally acceptable definition. Authenticity, accuracy, and fidelity are often offered to explain the definition, rather than taking the word "reliable" at face value, which has a multitude of different interpretations in different contexts. While the definition varies among jurisdictions, it is generally agreed that the evidence is considered to be what it purports to be and has not been tainted or contaminated in some way. It is helpful to define the reliability of digital evidence in terms of the protection of its integrity with respect to:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The reliability of forensic tools used in its collection and preservation</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The efficacy of the recovery and protection process</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The absence of human or machine contamination of the digital evidence</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The adequacy of device and network security to protect the digital evidence</li></ul></div></div><div class="section" title="The importance of the reliability of forensic tools and processes"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec62"/>The importance of the reliability of forensic tools and processes</h2></div></div></div><p>Practitioners use a variety of forensic tools to search large datasets and complex computer file structures to recover files relevant to a case for further analysis. When acquiring and processing digital evidence, evidence may easily be contaminated and ruin other potential <a id="id249" class="indexterm"/>evidence stored on a device. It is normal practice for practitioners to make forensic images of each device, thereby facilitating the identification of further evidence through further analysis. There is a problem if the acquisition tools and forensic processes fail to preserve and lead to the contamination of evidence. Data may be overwritten or lost, and false information could be retrieved if some software program has been set as a booby trap to conceal or destroy evidence, for example.</p><p>Courts have questioned the admissibility of digital evidence because of concerns of contamination during recovery and have denied evidence from being admitted because of suspected contamination. The Daubert Test, mentioned in <a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Hardware and Software Environments">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Hardware and Software Environments</em></span>, is used extensively in the United States to evaluate the validity of tools and recovery processes, but it is regrettably yet to be widely used in other jurisdictions.</p><p>Courts have recognized that with the pervasiveness and increasing significance of digital evidence, there is a concomitant increase of risk of evidence being tampered with. Many courts recognize that digital evidence presents more complicated variations of the authentication problem than do paper documents. In the case of digital evidence, some forensic expertise may be required to verify that the evidence is trustworthy. Evidence considered untrustworthy may be considered inadmissible in legal proceedings and becomes <a id="id250" class="indexterm"/>irrelevant to the case and, of course, detrimental to one of the contending parties.</p><p>

These management systems incorporated in computer databases are often linked through electronic networks to a range of internal and external users who need to access and use the information.</p><p>While an efficient and convenient system for managing information, these databases are vulnerable to a range of threats capable of degrading the overall reliability of the records they hold. When connected through a networked system, these computer databases face even greater risks, being vulnerable to a variety of threats that may jeopardize their admissibility as reliable evidence.</p><p>Increasingly, networked database system administrators and users are confronted by security problems from a wide range of threats. System security is not showing any signs of real improvement, and some argue that it may be getting worse. The problem of network database security, attributed to the rapid development of information technology during the past 40 years, appears to be further exacerbated by it developing at different rates, in different locations, and in different industries.</p><p>Although some courts have imposed stringent requirements to verify the authenticity and accuracy of digital records, it has been more often the case that more courts have been less demanding in accepting assurances as to the authenticity of such evidence. Fraud trials, for example, frequently involve altered paper documentation, which, through various techniques, can easily be altered, and while defendants challenge the authenticity of the evidence, courts will not support such claims based on the unsubstantiated supposition of alteration or fabrication.</p><p>However, there is a view that because of the different characteristics of digital evidence, it requires closer scrutiny to verify that sufficient evidence of authenticity and relevance is present to be considered admissible. Often, the circumstances of the preservation of a paper document are paramount, not the circumstances of its creation, so as to assure that evidence being tendered is what it purports to be. Digital evidence is of a different format and poses more complicated authentication problems than does paper records.</p><p>English courts have long adopted the "best evidence rule" in determining the admissibility of evidence on the grounds that they will attribute more credence to the best evidence available, notably original documents and oral testimony. This rule also applies to <a id="id252" class="indexterm"/>network-stored data, although the retention of original digital information will require some degree of authentication and assurances as to the integrity of the network security.</p></div><div class="section" title="Corroborating digital evidence"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec64"/>Corroborating digital evidence</h2></div></div></div><p>As in traditional legal cases, it is always desirable to corroborate digital evidence wherever <a id="id253" class="indexterm"/>possible. Windows Registry, for example, retains records of the operating and application systems' environment and can be used to corroborate and explain other located evidence. But it too may need to be corroborated with other information stored on the computer rather than being taken at face value. Such corroboration might include consulting application log files and <code class="literal">.lnk</code> files.</p><p>As mentioned previously, computer clocks are inherently unreliable timekeepers with a propensity to change time almost imperceptibly. Over time, this can result in inaccurate timekeeping that may adversely affect the validity of timelines. There have been cases of network terminals being more than a year slow because of failure to synchronize with a reliable timekeeping service.</p><p>Proving the authenticity and correctness of digital evidence is a constant requirement in legal cases to determine its evidentiary worth. Taken at face value, there is a danger that digital evidence has sufficient evidentiary weight, and some form of corroboration helps add to its value. For example, the operating system may create some instability that may skew evidence, such as the accuracy of file timestamps or identifying user access, leaving it to be misinterpreted.</p><p>Documentary evidence may also provide corroboration in support of specific digital evidence. For example, the evidence of an incriminating document being created on a work computer and then printed may show which user account created the document because of a microdot identifier on the printed document. This would be especially helpful if the electronic records of the printer and the computer were unclear as to the history of the document, printer spool records often being overwritten and difficult to interpret conclusively. Such processes, including microprinting, are commonly used to prevent and detect forgery of computer-created documents. The following site provides some recent developments in <a id="id254" class="indexterm"/>such security protection:</p><p>

</p><p>Corroboration may be enhanced by the use of human testimony. A witness can testify that the suspect was at the keyboard at the time of the offense. Conversely, a true alibi may be provided by a witness who confirms that the suspect was not present at the computer at the alleged time. This is highlighted in the following real-life case study.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Case study &#x2013; linking the evidence to the user"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl1sec30"/>Case study – linking the evidence to the user</h1></div></div></div><p>Consider a recent case where a departing employee contrived to forge a $50,000 separation bonus<a id="id255" class="indexterm"/> assisted by the company accountant. The employee e-mailed the accountant to seek the CEO's approval requesting that the bonus be backdated to a time prior to the takeover of the company by a new owner. The letter of approval tendered to obtain payment was backdated but not received and paid to the employee until after the takeover by the new owner, who believed that it was a pre-takeover arrangement. What later attracted the attention of the new owner was the large amount of the bonus. Further inquiry revealed that the e-mail records between the employee and the accountant were deleted from the employee's computer, in itself thought a highly suspicious act by the new owners.</p><p>Fortunately, the e-mails were recovered from the e-mail server, but no record of the creation of the letter approving the bonus was located on the accountant's or CEO's computers. Using forensic tools, the e-mails were partially recovered from the employee's computer and the bonus attachment was recovered from a deleted e-mail backup file (<code class="literal">.OST</code>). Staff members who had tried to piece together the e-mails on the two computers did so without any formal forensic knowledge and altered several related documents that had been attached to the incriminating e-mails. The last accessed and modified dates had been inadvertently altered, preventing a fuller reconstruction of user access to the documents.</p><p>Potentially, allegations by a defense lawyer recognizing that there had been access to the files after the computers had been returned by the employees could be made to suggest that the e-mails could have been altered or falsified by these staff members. It was possible to determine the document metadata from server records. However, the timestamps on the e-mails and documents, so crucial to prove a conspiracy to falsify the bonus claim and approval, were now compromised.</p><p>Examination of the bonus approval document showed that it had been scanned from an original signed document and saved in PDF format. This document had retained its creation date but no authorship details. It appeared that the CEO's electronic signature had appeared on the original document, which was not recovered. The dates appended to the signature were handwritten and pre-dated the sale of the company. The CEO's electronic signature was present on a number of other documents found in the accountant's e-mail files and could possibly have been added to the original text document prior to it being scanned.</p><p>However, the PDF metadata showed that the document had most likely been created post-takeover and was confirmed to be a scanned document by virtue of its content and identification by the ILookIX scan-detection tool. The tool was able to open up volume shadow snapshots that recovered and deconstructed the e-mail backup file containing various deleted e-mails. These e-mails, corroborated by the more reliable records stored on the server, assisted in reconstructing the case antecedents, which could then be used in subsequent legal proceedings.</p><p>This case<a id="id256" class="indexterm"/> exemplifies the value of file content and metadata, but it also demonstrates the vulnerability of the data to deliberate and unintentional human action resulting in evidence contamination. Had the fraudster had the wit and opportunity to delete e-mails while still synchronized to the e-mail server, those records too would have been erased and not necessarily recovered. This also shows the need to ensure that e-mail servers keep a full record of all e-mail messages, even those deleted by users. A backup of the e-mail stores for defined periods is often a legislative requirement of government organizations. In many countries, this is mandatory for public companies, as enacted in the US under the far-reaching provisions of the Sarbannes-Oxley Act of 2002.</p></div>
