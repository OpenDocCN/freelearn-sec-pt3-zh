  <div><h1 id="_idParaDest-5" class="mainHeading">Preface</h1>
    <p class="normal">Welcome to the world of digital forensics! In this book, you will be going into the depths of the Windows operating system to determine the user’s actions on the system. You will also learn about the different filesystems used by the Windows operating system. The role of the examiner is not only about the examination, but also about the report you generate and how you explain your findings. You will learn how to prepare for a digital investigation, including equipment selection, training, and planning a response to the crime scene. It is my hope that this book will be your resource if you are a novice examiner or an experienced examiner.</p>
    <p class="normal">This book teaches forensic examiners and those who want to become forensic examiners about the various skills and tasks required to be a forensic examiner, completing forensic analyses in either criminal or civil matters. This book will deliver information through the lens of the author’s experience in the United States of America so references to criminal matters will involve American law.</p>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-6" class="heading-1">Who this book is for</h1>
    <p class="normal">This book is for the novice and experienced examiner in private or public employment sectors. While an understanding of operating systems, file systems is helpful, it is not required.</p>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-7" class="heading-1">What this book covers</h1>
    <p class="normal"><em class="chapterRef">Chapter 1</em>, <em class="italic">Types of Computer-Based Investigations</em>, introduces to the reader the different topics of computer-based investigations, from criminal acts investigated by the police to potentially illegal actions performed by an employee or third parties and examined by a non-governmental investigator. While the goal is the same—to present evidence about an incident—the methods of the two slightly differ. It is essential for the reader to understand the similarities, that is, being able to present evidence in judicial proceedings, and recognize the differences, that is, search warrant requirements for a government agent.</p>
    <p class="normal"><em class="chapterRef">Chapter 2</em>, <em class="italic">The Forensic Analysis Process</em>, details the critical thinking in the planning of providing digital investigative services. This topic will allow the reader to create a strategy to conduct an efficient investigation. The reader will learn to offer different approaches to conduct an investigation depending on the unique set of circumstances for each matter.</p>
    <p class="normal"><em class="chapterRef">Chapter 3</em>, <em class="italic">Acquisition of Evidence</em>, explains that digital evidence is one of the most volatile pieces of evidence an investigator can handle. The mishandling of digital evidence can severely impact an investigation. Additionally, you may destroy the entire dataset. This chapter will address how to minimize or eliminate these issues when using a validation process to create a forensic image.</p>
    <p class="normal"><em class="chapterRef">Chapter 4</em>, <em class="italic">Computer Systems</em>, explains that the investigator must control the computer processes while acquiring digital evidence. When dealing with the many combinations of operating systems and hardware, you must implement controls to protect the integrity of the evidence. This chapter will discuss the boot process in detail and identify the most commonly used filesystems.</p>
    <p class="normal"><em class="chapterRef">Chapter 5</em>, <em class="italic">Computer Investigation Process</em>, explains that being a forensic examiner is much more than pushing a button. Once the evidence has been collected, you have to analyze the dataset. It is not about finding artifacts but rather examining the data and putting it into a context that will either support or not support the hypothesis about the user’s actions on the system.</p>
    <p class="normal"><em class="chapterRef">Chapter 6</em>, <em class="italic">Windows Artifact Analysis</em>, explains that Microsoft Windows is by far the most common operating system today. In this chapter, we will look at the different versions of Windows and will show the reader how to identify and recover common artifacts based on the release of Windows being examined.</p>
    <p class="normal"><em class="chapterRef">Chapter 7</em>, <em class="italic">RAM Memory Forensic Analysis</em>, covers the analysis of RAM, which is a source of evidence that has recently been recognized as containing vital information about the user’s actions on the system. RAM is very volatile evidence and can provide data that cannot be found anywhere else on the computer system.</p>
    <p class="normal"><em class="chapterRef">Chapter 8</em>, <em class="italic">Email Forensics – Investigation Techniques</em>, discusses email, which is a part of everyday life. This communication vector can be one of the primary communication tools for the majority of the population. These communications can contain incredible amounts of data related to an investigation. The investigator must be able to reconstruct the path that email took from the source to the destination to determine its validity.</p>
    <p class="normal"><em class="chapterRef">Chapter 9</em>, <em class="italic">Internet Artifacts</em>, explains that using the internet is a daily activity for the majority of the population. Like any other activity, the internet can be used for legal, law-abiding business, or for criminal activity. The internet can be accessed in a variety of ways. The forensic investigator must be able to analyze all these different aspects of the internet to get to the truth of the matter.</p>
    <p class="normal"><em class="chapterRef">Chapter 10</em>, <em class="italic">Online Investigations</em>, discusses how to use open-source intelligence techniques to learn about the target of the investigations. Also discussed are the steps an investigator can take to hide their true identity and create an undercover online persona.</p>
    <p class="normal"><em class="chapterRef">Chapter 11</em>, <em class="italic">Networking Basics</em>, explains some of the common network protocols, hardware and models that are being used to connect devices and share information. The ability to understand how information is shared between devices is a critical skill for the online investigator.</p>
    <p class="normal"><em class="chapterRef">Chapter 12</em>, <em class="italic">Report Writing</em>, covers report writing, which is not the most exciting portion of the forensic exam process. The forensic examiner must be able to explain a technical topic to a non-technical user. As a forensic examiner, you must be able to place that artifact into a context that the audience understands. This ability is a critical skill that you need to master to be a competent forensic examiner.</p>
    <p class="normal"><em class="chapterRef">Chapter 13</em>, <em class="italic">Expert Witness Ethics</em>, explains that a forensic examiner must be objective, truthful, honest, and perform their due diligence when conducting an examination. The examiner will be providing testimony that may result in someone losing their freedom. The ultimate goal of the investigation conducted by the forensic examiner is to provide testimony or evidence in a judicial or administrative proceeding to stop the cybercriminal’s activity.</p>
