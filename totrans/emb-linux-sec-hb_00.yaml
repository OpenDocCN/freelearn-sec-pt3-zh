- en: Welcome to *The Embedded Linux Security Handbook*. Together, we’ll be embarking
    on a journey of knowledge – a deep exploration of what is considered (by many)
    tribal knowledge. This is the kind of stuff you cannot find online. My purpose
    for writing this book is to share my vast knowledge of applying security and best
    practices to the creation of Linux appliances.

    evolution mixed with a healthy dose of preparation and vigilance.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book will take you on a hands-on journey of how and when to apply best
    practices and access public and private security resources, as well as the often-complex
    application of security measures throughout the myriad tasks required to create
    a secure and supportable Linux-based appliance solution.

- en: By the end of this journey, you’ll be best positioned to design, prototype,
    build, and support embedded Linux systems (and products) like never before. So,
    grab your favorite beverage and a notebook, and let’s get moving.

    will get the most out of what I am presenting here are product teams, embedded
    software engineers, security professionals, and architects – more specifically,
    those who are directly or indirectly involved with the scoping, design, creation,
    and supporting of embedded Linux systems appliances.
