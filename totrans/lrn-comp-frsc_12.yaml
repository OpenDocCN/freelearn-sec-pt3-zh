- en: I have worked with examiners who loved getting down to the bits and bytes of
    investigation. No one worked harder as they examined the digital evidence, tracking
    the digital breadcrumbs until they had the evidence they needed. They were intelligent
    and brilliant, and if I had committed a digital crime, I would not want them to
    investigate it. It had nothing to do with their ability to investigate and everything
    to do with their ability to write a report. To say their report was lacking is
    a massive understatement.

- en: Report writing is one of the hardest things you can do as a digital forensic
    investigator. You must take a very technical subject and explain it in a manner
    that a non-technical person will understand while not making any assumptions about
    the potential user or the digital evidence.

    report on your digital forensic investigation. Your notes will be the foundation
    of your reporting. A simple phrase that has impacted me as I conduct my exams
    is *if you do not write it down, it did not happen*. One of your examinations
    may take days or months; you will simply not be able to remember what exactly
    you did on day 14 of your examination.

    to the scene. This includes the date/time when you are notified, who notified
    you, and when you arrived at the scene. Document any actions you take; if you
    collected volatile data, RAM from the system in question, did you alter the digital
    evidence? The answer will be *yes*. This is where the *why* is essential. *Why*
    did you alter the digital evidence? Here, the answer is simple – because the evidence
    would be lost if it was not collected at that time.

    digital evidence is contained in a server environment. You cannot (in most cases)
    shut down the server to create a whole disk forensic image; you will have to create
    a logical forensic image of the files in question. Once again, the question of
    *why* may be asked, and you will have to explain.

    you are writing the report for the Chief of Information, the IT security section,

    technical detail than the report directed toward lawyers, judges, or juries. If
    you go into minute detail about every artifact you found, you will lose your non-technical
    audience. While the technical audience will want those types of specific details
    and may feel insulted if you explain the details in a non-technical manner, it
    is possible to draft a report that addresses the technical and non-technical audience.

    and acronyms. If you are in the criminal justice environment and the prosecuting
    attorney will read your report, you will most likely educate them on the technical
    aspect. Define the technical terms and concepts within the detailed narrative.
    How detailed does the narrative need to be?
  prefs: []

    You should also include the date the hardware/software was verified. Your narrative
    should consist of a step-by-step analysis of how you (or a colleague) created
    the forensic image(s). Include descriptions of what steps were performed as expected
    and also include what did not function as expected. If the forensic image hash
    value was not verified, include that fact in your report and what steps you took
    to troubleshoot the issue. Finally, you must understand if there was an issue

    be a printout of pages of files you deemed pertinent to the investigation. You
    have to analyze the artifact(s) and explain why it is relevant to the investigation
    to the reader. Include screenshots to help reference the reader to your explanation.
    Including a screenshot does not remove the requirement to explain what the screenshot
    is depicting. Tell the reader why the screenshot is important and explain the
    relevance to the investigation. Do not assume the reader can determine what information
    in a screenshot is important. There are several different ways to present your
    analysis. You can do this chronologically, by device, or by the suspect. There
    is no right or wrong way to write this section. My preference is to create the
    report chronologically and by subject. For example, for a storage device that
    was the system drive for a desktop/laptop, I would establish ownership and usage
    of the device. Then, I would move on to the specific artifacts of the incident
    being investigated. Be careful not to get too far into the weeds and be overly
    technical with your technical descriptions. I would include that information with
    the specific exhibit you are describing in the Exhibits/technical details section
    for the technical descriptions.

    date/timestamps in the file record in the MFT.

    This is where you offer your opinions on the subject’s culpability in your digital

    on my examination of the following evidence (list the items you examined in the
    course of your digital forensic examination), it is my opinion…* – and then lay
    out the facts based on the artifacts you analyzed. You want to avoid any inflammatory/descriptive

    you used in the exam process. If you reference the artifact in the narrative,
    you must include it in the Exhibits/technical detail section; likewise, if you
    have an exhibit in that section, you must reference it in your narrative. I find
    it helpful to organize the exhibits and technical details in the same order I
    referenced them in the narrative. It helps the reader comprehend the report’s
    content if they view the exhibits after reading the narrative and they are in
    the same order.

- en: I cannot stress enough how important it is for you to proofread your report.
    You will not create a perfect report the first time around (or the second time).
    You will have grammar, spelling, and content errors in the report. Therefore,
    you should always have a second person proofread the report after making the first
    draft. The second person will find mistakes you missed and help determine how
    the report flows from one section to the next. You already have an idea in your
    head of what to say; the second proof-reader will help determine if this is effective.
    The second proof-reader will also bring a different insight to the report’s presentation
    and help ensure that your conclusions are logical and without bias. Whenever I
    proofread a colleague’s report, I would look at it from the opposition’s point
    of view. My goal was to find inconsistencies or gaps that the opposition could
    exploit if the matter went to trial. Another option is once the report has been
    finalized, your organization may have a peer-review process. A supervisor or colleague
    reviews your report and findings to ensure you followed the appropriate policies
    and procedures and that your conclusions are fact-based.

- en: What format should your report be in when it is disseminated to the stakeholders?
    My preference was to deliver my reports in a digitally signed PDF. If the report
    is altered, it will break the digital signature. Some digital forensic investigators
    will create an HTML-based report and burn it onto an optical disk, while others
    will use the reporting function of their forensic tool. You can use many options
    in the report’s presentation; you will want to make sure you can authenticate
    its contents if you have to testify in a judicial/administrative proceeding. A
    PDF will allow you to authenticate with a digital signature while saving the report
    and related data to an optical disk, which will enable you to create a hash value
    to ensure that no one has changed the contents.
