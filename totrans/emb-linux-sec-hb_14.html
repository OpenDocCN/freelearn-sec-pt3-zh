			<h1 id="_idParaDest-215"><a id="_idTextAnchor431"/>Customer and Community Feedback Loops</h1>&#13;
			<p>Welcome to the final chapter, where we will hopefully help you close the infinite loop by guiding you on how to engage your prospective community. Ultimately, it is your customers that drive your solution by having an unfulfilled need. Don’t just help them to scratch that itch; help them to achieve great success. Their success becomes yours as well.</p>&#13;
			<p>The goal of this chapter is not to teach you CI/CD but to enlighten you on the value provided by continuous interaction and feedback from your end-users, executives, and the overall community that leverages your product to solve their problems. You can expect these interactions to provide invaluable insights into use cases, methodologies, and usage patterns that you may not have previously foreseen. The data acquired will fuel future features and innovations, while undoubtedly helping you make your product more secure in the process. This is where your customers return value to the cause.</p>&#13;
			<p>Your efforts in gathering feedback are the final step in the perpetual <strong class="bold">CI/CD loop</strong> before progressing to develop the next update:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li>Plan</li>&#13;
				<li>Build</li>&#13;
				<li>Continuous integration</li>&#13;
				<li>Deploy</li>&#13;
				<li>Continuous feedback</li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<p>There will be no hands-on exercises in this chapter, but do not think that you’ll have no work to do. I will be setting some challenges for you and your team. How you address these challenges could determine the overall success or grievous failure of your project. So, without further ado, let’s take those final steps and close the CI/CD loop together.</p>&#13;
			<p>In this chapter, the main sections are:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>Use case development</li>&#13;
				<li>User groups</li>&#13;
				<li>Executive roundtables</li>&#13;
				<li>Community feedback loops</li>&#13;
				<li>Closing the loop: End-of-book summary</li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>Let’s now move on to the first section, where we’ll review your use cases.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-216"><a id="_idTextAnchor432"/>Use case development</h1>&#13;
			<p>Wait, didn’t we <a id="_idIndexMarker605"/>cover this earlier in the book? Hmmmm. Yes, we did, actually – back in <a href="B22104_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor044"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>. But we just scratched the surface. What you’re going to find in this chapter will be far more… prescriptive. A significant part of this chapter will be the flip side of the coin of what I have previously mentioned about engagement.</p>&#13;
			<p>This will not be redundant. Previously, I tasked you with engaging more with your customers. That is assumed by now. In this chapter, where we are closing the entire CI/CD loop, I am challenging YOU to take the steps beyond basic engagement. In fact, I am recommending that you and your team create your own specific engagement methods with your prospective customer base and, more so, create a community. In other words, don’t just join a community – build and lead one!</p>&#13;
			<p>Here, I am tasking you with truly getting actual information, research, and guidance from those who shall become your customer base. These people are the truest key to getting you to a spot where you can actually define what your future product must do and what security implications must be adhered to, as well as understanding what features they want versus must have.</p>&#13;
			<p>Use cases themselves will determine how your future user base will leverage your solution. How they consume the services that your appliance provides will drive security measures that must be planned for (UI, user-level access, tamper-proofing, etc.). How you get this information is the challenge this chapter is dedicated to solving.</p>&#13;
			<p>Additionally, feedback from your users could potentially identify security concerns or missing security measures that your team might not have incorporated into that release of the<a id="_idIndexMarker606"/> appliance. Encouraging open feedback with your users is a great source of product improvement recommendations – always. Ignore their feedback at your own peril.</p>&#13;
			<p>Let’s progress to our first method of information gathering – creating and hosting <strong class="bold">user </strong><strong class="bold">group</strong> meetings<a id="_idTextAnchor433"/>.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-217"><a id="_idTextAnchor434"/>User groups</h1>&#13;
			<p>Earlier in <a id="_idIndexMarker607"/>this book, in <a href="B22104_11.xhtml#_idTextAnchor339"><em class="italic">Chapter 11</em></a>, I suggested that you get involved in security community user groups. I am not deviating from that recommendation. This section is not remotely about that. Here, I am challenging you to find the highest concentration of what could be your user base and create a user group in that area.</p>&#13;
			<p>This user group will be focused on your product, how it’s used, its future, and what they need you to maintain or improve. Create your own community for your products. I cannot emphasize how important this is. The feedback you get from these people will be crucial to the success of your products. If the user base doesn’t believe you are progressing in the correct direction, they might just abandon your product.</p>&#13;
			<p>Learning exactly how your products are deployed and consumed might surprise you. You might find out they are not being used as intended. That in itself could impact the security and integrity of your product. Conversely, you could also come to the conclusion that a function or security precaution may have been overlooked.</p>&#13;
			<p>You might even get excellent insight from your users on not only how to make their experiences more pleasurable and efficient but also what features could set your product apart from others. Never underestimate the gems user groups could reveal.</p>&#13;
			<p>How you engage these people will alter how they perceive your product and, ultimately, how they perceive your company as a whole. Engage, be open, and, most of all, open your ears to their thoughts and concerns. These interactions are priceless opportunities to establish trust with your user base by not only letting their voices be heard but also reinforcing that their opinions matter. When they know their opinions matter, they feel like part of the solution themselves and more like a community, rather than just a customer to a vendor.</p>&#13;
			<p>Here’s an example of what a successful user group engagement might look like.</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 14.1 – User groups drive customer engagement</p>&#13;
			<p>These meetings<a id="_idIndexMarker608"/> must never be sales-y; in fact, you should keep your sales group away. These groups work best when your users can interact with product management and engineers. <em class="italic">Techies talking to techies</em> – this works best.</p>&#13;
			<p>Here is a recommendation. Near the end of your first few meetings, query the audience on their thoughts on the meeting cadence, content they’d like to be covered in future sessions, and the duration of the gatherings (are they too long, too short, <a id="_idTextAnchor435"/>or just right?).</p>&#13;
			<p>One thing I have always found engaging and that leads to success is asking people in the audience to openly share their thoughts on a recent experience that they have had with the product, whether positive or negative. Nothing should be formal. This is a great way to encourage attendees to become more engaged.</p>&#13;
			<p>Finally, once your user group is somewhat well established, your next mission is to encourage customers and partners to be part of the agenda. Presentations, demos, or just a quick lightning talk performed by either a customer or a partner go a great way toward building your community and securing trust. Let them talk about the good, the bad, and the ugly, along with HOW they solved a problem and the product added value to their organization.</p>&#13;
			<p>In the next section, we’ll review how to engage a different level of leadership – how to get executive sponsorship – within your customer bas<a id="_idTextAnchor436"/>e.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-218"><a id="_idTextAnchor437"/>Executive roundtables</h1>&#13;
			<p>While <a id="_idIndexMarker609"/>engaging your user base can create a great passion for your product and provide significant insights into usage patterns, creating meaningful relationships with industry executives will drive adoption and visibility and establish a true conduit for your customers to help you drive innovation and greater usability and security in your product.</p>&#13;
			<p>Having an executive sponsor grants you a <em class="italic">force multiplier</em>. That executive can drive the rapid adoption of your product. Moreso, they can provide your team with crucial insights into how implementation and integration operations are actually preceding and how your product is perceived.</p>&#13;
			<p>Executives might also take an interest in liaising or coordinating features with your engineering teams. Their insights on security and compliance could alter your perspective.</p>&#13;
			<p>Here’s what an executive roundtable session might look like for your team.</p>&#13;
			<p>&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 14.2 – Executive roundtables drive engagement</p>&#13;
			<p>Now that you’ve <a id="_idIndexMarker610"/>obtained executive sponsorship and established key leadership channels of communication, let’s move on to how to tap into the general communi<a id="_idTextAnchor438"/>ty.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-219"><a id="_idTextAnchor439"/>Community feedback loops</h1>&#13;
			<p>There are <a id="_idIndexMarker611"/>many methods that you can leverage to engage your community. Use all of them: events, user groups, roundtables, surveys, and active research efforts. Earlier in the book, specifically <a href="B22104_11.xhtml#_idTextAnchor339"><em class="italic">Chapter 11</em></a>, I challenged you to get involved within the Linux and security communities. Here, I am outright challenging you to create your own community.</p>&#13;
			<p>Once your company starts selling its product, like it or not, your users will find a way to share information informally. These information-sharing activities may start on message boards and evolve naturally into informal groups.</p>&#13;
			<p>This is your <a id="_idIndexMarker612"/>greatest opportunity to shape the evolving community. Host message boards. Create a user group somewhere where there is a high concentration of your users. This might mean creating several unique group meeting environments across multiple geographic regions or cities. Start small where the largest concentration of your users exists and get feedback from them when you decide to expand and create new groups in other locations.</p>&#13;
			<p>You likely won’t be able to address all pockets of users across the globe. You can keep your users engaged with newsletters and surveys. Never expect a 100% response rate to surveys unless something bad has occurred with your product. But these communications are no substitute for direct interactions. The goal here is not simply continuous engagement (which does have some value) but hopefully to encourage a user base to further become a community by having their voices heard and keeping them informed. My personal opinion is that you can actually engage too much. Don’t be like a certain unnamed online vendor that asks you to complete a survey for every order. Make your interactions add value to the recipient or do not interact at all.</p>&#13;
			<p>This is where I recommend hosting events. The target audience for these is everyone. Possible customers, partners, users, executives, and industry-focused media are all your desired targets. Each will provide their own opinions and input. These events can be made up of multiple simultaneous sessions, with different target audiences all at the same time. Product information, training, and panel-based Q&amp;A sessions are the kings here.</p>&#13;
			<p>Ultimately, I am not speaking about how to market your product here. So many others could do a much better job at discussing that than I could. My point to all of this is to get and stay engaged with your community as a whole and to make it grow positively. Knowing their needs and then addressing them in your solution will continue to drive success and help you achieve a more secure product in the process.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-220"><a id="_idTextAnchor440"/>Summary</h1>&#13;
			<p>We’ve arrived at the end of the trail now. This final chapter has touched on critical aspects of how to gather and ingest feedback from outside your organization. These efforts, often running in parallel to each other, will altogether give your team a virtual weather report of sorts as to exactly how your product is received and perceived and what changes you can make to make gains in security and adoption. They are also a great indication of what the community feels your product got right and you should sustain in future releases... Take these golden nuggets for what they are – an amazing level of insight that you didn’t have to pay industry analysts for.</p>&#13;
			<p>Finally, let’s move on to a wrap-up of the book, or the end-of-book sum<a id="_idTextAnchor441"/>mary.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-221"><a id="_idTextAnchor442"/>Closing the loop</h1>&#13;
			<p>First, I have to say – thank you for taking this journey with me. Albeit this is the end of the book, but I truly hope that it is just the beginning of a new journey for you, and that that journey has many bright things in store for you and your company. It has been a pleasure and an honor to have been your guide.</p>&#13;
			<p>For me, this is the end of the book, the end of my narrative, and the end of my security-focused rant, but not the end of the story. I will continue to provide updates to the book’s GitHub repository. You should check there periodically to see what new goodies have been added. It could be revised labs, updates, or more examples of embedded Linux awesome<a id="_idTextAnchor443"/>ness.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-222"><a id="_idTextAnchor444"/>Putting all the pieces together</h2>&#13;
			<p>The intent of this book was to take you, my much-appreciated reader, through a progression of knowledge that you can apply to your projects regardless of the decisions you had to make. Let’s go through this progression of best practices, security operations, configurations, and tooling and how we should put them all together.</p>&#13;
			<p>In the first part of the book – <em class="italic">Introduction to Embedded Systems and Secure Design</em> – we took a deep introspective journey into embedded Linux systems: what these systems are, who uses them, and the arduous task of applying design criteria.</p>&#13;
			<p>The key concepts you should now have a firmer grasp of are understanding what an embedded Linux system appliance is, who uses it, and how compliance efforts drive the overall solution, starting with the selection of the hardware and operating system itself.</p>&#13;
			<p>In the second part of the book – <em class="italic">Design Components</em> – we took the knowledge gained from understanding our design criteria and applied different security components to our designs. This is where we actually started playing with many technologies in a hands-on manner. We left behind the theoretical mentality of the first section and replaced it with practical application.</p>&#13;
			<p>The key concepts you should have taken away from this section started with what tools you might need to implement within your build chain, followed by some very detailed and specific security measures to take within your software and hardware configurations, and closed with all the idiosyncrasies induced by tamper-proofing your solution from the end-users themselves.</p>&#13;
			<p>In the third and final section of the book – <em class="italic">The Build Chain, Appliance Lifecycle, and Continuous Improvement</em> – we addressed how one can create a sustainable CI/CD chain that doesn’t just automate builds and tests. To have the most perfect loop, there must also be human inputs and outputs of this chain. That means you need to create a community for your product/project. The care and feeding of this community are as important as the level of attention and due diligence that you give your product.</p>&#13;
			<p>The takeaways from this section are enormous. By this point, you should be putting everything together in your head. You now know what resources are at your fingertips to keep you informed and ahead of the game. You also know how to practically test and implement security in your solution. Which brings us to where we are now, in this chapter, where we closed the continuous feedback loop with insights from your community.</p>&#13;
			<p>We have shared a long journey together, and I’d like to move on to my final challenge for<a id="_idTextAnchor445"/> you.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-223"><a id="_idTextAnchor446"/>Staying engaged</h2>&#13;
			<p>This should not be the end of the road for you. The single greatest challenge that I can leave you with now is for you to stay engaged, and even more so to stay vigilant. The threat landscape is ever-changing, so you must stay ahead of the curve by staying informed and educated.</p>&#13;
			<p>Don’t just keep yourself engaged. Keep your team engaged. It will continue to take a village to ensure the security of your product. It’s not a one-time effort. Don’t let your guard down after a couple of successful releases.</p>&#13;
			<p>Another <em class="italic">don’t</em> – I implore you to heed this warning: “Don’t stop learning!” Evolve personally and professionally faster than the threat landscape. Drive your own success. Security is more than a process – it’s a state of mind.</p>&#13;
			<p>Again, thank you for your time, support, and attention. I truly hope this book has helped you.</p>&#13;
