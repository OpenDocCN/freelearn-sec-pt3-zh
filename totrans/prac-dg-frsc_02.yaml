    of the century were magnetic discs, floppy drives, and tape drives. Magnetic tapes
    and disks store digital data in binary form, that is, as 1s and 0s, as magnetic
    data on the surface of metal platters. Magnetic disks rotate these magnetized
    platters at high speed close to an electromagnetic read/write device, which enables
    selected portions of the surface to be read from or written to with a moveable
    arm. Magnetic tapes, on the other hand, can only be accessed in sequential order
    by playing the tape forward or backward. Both processes are still the predominant
    source of storage devices to date. For the time being, they are of paramount importance
    in reconstructing the activities of users relating to some transgression under

    storage device unless later removed, destroyed, or lost through some physical
    deterioration of the device. This type of memory is termed **non-volatile memory**.

    data from a network, because the data is stored on a device distinct from the

    the normal consumer access process to the resource, often owned by another entity.
    One of the challenges in recovering data is difficulty in identifying the path
    that the data takes from the cloud server to the storage device, which may not
    be a fixed route (*Adams 2013*).

    the network servers storing the data, the process of obtaining a physical forensic
    image of the actual storage device is complicated; it is often unfeasible to do
    so. The network server may be located in one or more locations in different legal
    jurisdictions. This may often require travel and requests from the network operators
    to recover data, which is not always guaranteed (*Adams 2013*).

    on the host resource is likely to be an instance of a virtual machine, which is
    also likely to be one of many on the same physical device. To acquire all the
    data, including deleted material and free space where non-erased information may
    be located, will require a copy of the virtual machine facilitated by someone
    with access to the server. This, too, raises problems with a third party being
    unwilling or having little incentive to assist in data recovery and possibly contaminating

    a human observer or perhaps a CCTV camera to place the suspect at the computer

    best or speculation at worst. The practitioner must be guided by the evidence
    and if that proves inconclusive, he or she must look for more evidentiary clues
    to offer likely hypotheses as to what happened. The practitioner collects all
    relevant evidence that supports various hypotheses, but it is for others, such

    data from devices—some transgression, offence, or activity that warrants the examination.
    The subject of the investigation tends to dictate the basic type of evidence that
    is being sought. However, finding the smoking gun may also mean looking for associated
    evidence that correlates with and corroborates the key evidence. It is also common
    for the examination to seek specific evidence in accordance with a legal brief,
    but during the examination, evidence of other transgressions may be recovered.

    device and linked to the transgression may record activities and may be useful
    for demonstrating how the transgression occurred. For example, the use of e-mail
    messaging to send a death threat or connecting to the Internet to download illegal
    pornography will leave an audit trail or event logs to allow a reconstruction
    of what happened and the processes involved. Reconstructing the transgression

    the crime to a suspect's access to the computer or network in the absence of any
    corroboration. Audit logs recording the details of specific users accessing a
    computer or network often assume that the person who used the authorized user's
    logon details and password was the actual user. Often, that may be so, but if
    another person gained unauthorized access to the user details and logged on to
    the system, it may be difficult to prove unless there is some other evidence,
    such as a human observer or perhaps a CCTV recording, to clarify what occurred.

    time. Computer user access security may prohibit unauthorized access transgression

    In criminal cases, much is made of assumptions as to who committed the offence,
    but it must be proven beyond reasonable doubt, and to a lesser extent in civil
    cases, where there is more of a balance of probability and a lower threshold.
    Yet, we still see a tendency to assume that the owner and custodian is usually
    the primary suspect for having carried out some unlawful activity. At least in
    the initial stages of an investigation, that seems logical. Further inquiry, though,
    can often show that others may have access to the computer or the network, so
    the circle of potential suspects widens. It follows that a thorough check of user
    access to the device must be completed. This is to show fairness in the examination

    police assertion that illegal movie files were most likely downloaded during the
    period between September and October 2004\. It was evident that these files were
    most likely downloaded to the laptop through the use of the LimeWire program,
    with the remainder downloaded in January 2005 and probably viewed at that time
    on the device.

    on an examination of the relevant file-creation dates of the executable parts
    of the programs. These applications play movie, audio, and image files. Both applications
    have the ability to record the viewing of the most recently played files. According
    to the agency report, a number of the most recently played files had the same
    filenames as those identified as the movies of interest. Re-examination of the
    data confirmed that a number of the illegal files had been accessed several times
    by RealPlayer and only on one occasion by Windows Media Player.

    and two obscene image files were created on the computer and accessed. The last
    accessed dates of the movie and images were inadvertently altered by the virus-scanning
    program, obfuscating the dates and making reconstruction of the movie and image
    viewer applications incomplete. The agency's misreading of the unreliable last
    accessed date of the key files was tendered as evidence of the files being accessed
    by a user, thereby extending the period of possible criminal activity. In fact,
    the file metadata challenged the assertion and weakened the prosecution claim.

- en: Taking the digital evidence at face value, at the point of seizure of the laptop,
    it may have seemed logical to assume that the defendant, the owner and custodian
    of the computer and whose house it was located in, was the likely suspect. However,
    others had access to the computer during the periods in which the movies were
    accessed and viewed between September 2005 to the date of seizure in 2006\. Moreover,
    a young couple who lived at the residence from late June 2005 to early February
    2006 also had unrestricted access. A number of other persons (friends of the couple)
    also had access to the laptop during the same period. Another person also lived
    at the residence between July 2005 and September 2005\. It was common for the
    defendant to take the laptop to his place of work, where others were granted unrestricted
    access to it.

    time some of the illegal files were downloaded and played on the laptop. The defendant's
    teenage child was present and had a number of friends stay over at the home on
    a weekly basis, and they were believed to have used the laptop. Password security
    was basic, and the password known to whoever wished to use it.

    that an illegal movie file was modified and written to on 17 October 2005, when
    the laptop was believed to be in the possession of the computer repairer. This
    matter was not raised by the prosecution or disclosed to the defense team, yet
    it raised the likelihood of another potential suspect.

    duplicates of the same files located on the device. However, re-examination of
    the forensic image showed there to be six unique movies and nine copies of some
    of the files in contrast to a much large number claimed by the prosecution. The
    lack of precise recording of the files key to the prosecution's case raised doubts
    as to the professionalism of the prosecution expert.

    Backdoor.Win32.Agent`, was evident on the computer. However, it was not shown
    that the malware had infected and facilitated control of the laptop rendering
    it vulnerable to unauthorized remote control. Again, checking of this malware''s
    activity on the laptop was left to the defense expert to determine and at cost
    to the defendant!'

    using questionable evidence and faulty analysis. Great care must always be taken
    to ensure evidence-led investigation and not a suspect-led process, as appears
    to have occurred in this investigation.

- en: This chapter described a variety of computers and storage devices and outlined
    the nature of digital information they hold of potential evidentiary value. The
    explanation of the functions and nature of operating system software and applications
    introduced the processes of file creation, file transfer, and the storage of electronic
    information. The chapter introduced and explained the nature of filesystems and
    outlined some typical files that contain evidence of evidentiary value and where
    they may be located on devices. A summary of password security and encryption
    has shown that digital devices are becoming more advanced and are using encryption
    as an effective security feature. This now poses some significant problems to
    practitioners attempting to look for concealed evidence.

    in [Chapter 3](ch03.html "Chapter 3. The Nature and Special Properties of Digital
    Evidence"), *The Nature and Special Properties of Digital Evidence*, which explains
    its nature and special attributes and really does dictate the forensic approach
    practitioners follow when engaged in case examinations. Digital evidence shares
    many of the characteristics of other types of evidence, but it does have unique
    properties of its own that make it both rewarding and challenging to explore and
    harness. [Chapter 3](ch03.html "Chapter 3. The Nature and Special Properties of
    Digital Evidence"), *The Nature and Special Properties of Digital Evidence*, highlights
    the technical complexities of digital evidence and the challenges they pose to
    practitioners in their analysis and explanation of the evidence to the courts.
    It defines the weight of admissibility and the requirements that digital forensics
    must meet for it to be considered admissible for use in legal cases.
