    and this growth is almost exponential in the field of mobile devices. Gartner,
    a technology research and advisory firm, in their forecasts published in January
    2018, estimated that mobile phone shipments in 2017 totaled 2.28 billion units
    and would increase to 2.32 billion in 2018\. This statistic alone reflects the
    unprecedented growth of mobile devices. Mobile phones have not only increased
    in number but also have become more sophisticated in terms of functionality. The
    increase of mobile phone subscribers from 1997 to 2018 is significantly high.

    subset of mobile phones. The improvements in the computing power and data storage
    of these devices enable us to perform a wide range of activities, and we are increasingly
    becoming dependent on these mobile devices. Apart from performing routine tasks
    such as making calls and sending messages, and so on, these devices also support
    other activities such as sending emails, surfing the internet, recording videos,
    creating and storing documents, identifying locations with **Global Positioning
    System** (**GPS**) services, and managing business tasks. In other words, mobile

    Imagine a case involving the smartphone of a suspected terrorist; how useful would
    it be for law enforcement to access every contact, call, SMS, or email that the
    suspect had sent or received? Or, perhaps even better, every location that the
    phone had been? While much of this data is generally available through the service
    provider, that often requires additional warrants or subpoenas and can take a
    significant amount of time. And consider third-party applications; WhatsApp chat
    content, for example, is end-to-end encrypted, and no amount of subpoenas to Facebook
    can recover that data. This book will show you how to recover data, such as WhatsApp
    chats, that may not be recoverable through any other method. The fact that mobile
    forensics played a crucial role in solving cases such as the 2010 Times Square
    car bombing attempt and Boston marathon bombings, reaffirms the increasing role
    of mobile forensics in solving many cases.

    recovering, and analyzing digital evidence or data from a mobile device under
    forensically sound conditions. Simply put, it deals with accessing the data stored
    on devices, which includes SMS, contacts, call records, photos, videos, documents,
    application files, browsing history, and so on, and recovering data deleted from
    devices using various forensic techniques. It is important that the process of
    recovering or accessing details from a device is forensically sound if it has
    to be admitted in a court of law and to maintain the integrity of the evidence.
    If the evidence has to be admitted in a court of law, it's important to work only
    on the image file and not on the original device itself.

    to clarify the correct use of a particular forensic technology or methodology.
    Mobile forensics, especially Android forensics, is evolving fast, owing to the
    fact that it has a total the market share of 85 percent (as per market research
    firm, IDC).

    forensic soundness is not just about keeping the original evidence unaltered.
    Even the routine task of acquiring data from a hard drive using a hardware write
    blocker may cause alterations (for example, making a hidden area of the hard drive
    accessible) on the drive. One of the keys to forensic soundness is documentation.
    Documenting how the device is handled from the beginning is very important. Hence,
    an investigation can be considered forensically sound if the acquisition process
    preserves the original data and its authenticity and integrity can be validated.
    Evidence integrity checks ensure that the evidence has not been tampered  with
    from the time it was collected. Integrity checks are done by comparing the digital
    fingerprint of the evidence taken at the time of collection with the digital fingerprint
    of the evidence in its current state.

    this function. But in mobile forensics, since we need to interact with the device
    to pull the data, these write blockers are not of any use. Another important aspect
    is that we also need to prevent the device from interacting with a wireless radio

    to remember in forensics is to preserve the original evidence. In other words,
    the forensic techniques that are applied on a device to extract any information
    should not alter the data present on the device. However, this is usually not
    practical with respect to mobile forensics because simply switching on a device
    might also change certain state variables present on the device. With mobile devices,
    background processes always run, and a sudden transition from one state to another
    can result in the loss or modification of data. Hence, there''s a chance that
    data may be altered either intentionally or unintentionally by the forensic analyst.
    Apart from this, there is a high possibility that an attacker (or the user) can
    remotely change or delete the contents of the device. As mobile phones use different
    communication channels (cellular, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, infrared, and so on), the
    possibility of communicating through them should be eliminated. Features such
    as remote data wiping would enable an attacker to remotely wipe the entire device
    just by sending an SMS or by simply pressing a button that sends a wipe request
    to the Android device. Unlike computer forensics, mobile device forensics requires
    more than just isolating the device from the network, and *phones cannot always
    be left powered off during examination*.'

    Also, for a given operating system, there are millions of mobile devices available
    that differ in OS versions, hardware, and various other features. Based on manufacturer,
    the approach to acquire forensic artifacts changes. To remain competitive, manufacturers
    release new models and updates so rapidly that it''s hard to keep a track of all
    of them. Sometimes, within the same operating system the data storage options
    and file structures also change, making it even more difficult. There''s no single
    tool that can work on all the available types of mobile operating systems. Hence,

    controls on devices, which complicates the process of gaining access to the data.
    For example, if the device is passcode protected, the forensic investigator has
    to first find a way to bypass the passcode. Similarly, full disk encryption mechanisms
    implemented on many modern devices prevent law enforcement agencies and forensic
    analysts from accessing the information on the device. Apple''s iPhone encrypts
    all of the data present on the device by default using hardware keys built into
    the device. Beginning with Android Nougat, Android forces full disk encryption
    by default (though it can vary if the OS is modified by the manufacturer). At
    Google''s 2017 I/O conference, they announced that 80% of Android 7.0 Nougat devices
    were encrypted and 70% used a secure lock screen. These numbers will likely continue
    to grow as encryption is forced by more manufacturers during the initial setup
    process. It is very difficult for an examiner to break these encryption mechanisms
    using techniques such as brute force.'

    made by Google. Linux was chosen as it is a portable platform that can be compiled
    easily on different hardware. The Linux kernel is positioned at the bottom of
    the software stack and provides a level of abstraction between the device hardware
    and the upper layers. It also acts as an abstraction layer between the software
    and hardware present on the device. To understand this better, consider the case
    of a camera click. What actually happens when you take a photo using the camera
    button on your mobile device? At some point, the hardware instruction (pressing
    a button) has to be converted into a software instruction (to take a picture and

    and with the permissions it has. This application sandboxing is done at the kernel
    level. The security between applications and the system at the process level is

    by the Android security model. Android security is based on discretionary access
    control, which means applications can ask for permissions, and users can grant
    or deny those permissions. Hence, malware can create havoc on the phones by gaining
    permissions. Android uses SELinux to enforce mandatory access control that ensures
    applications work in isolated environments; this includes applications running
    as root or superuser. Hence, even if a user installs a malicious app, the malware
    cannot easily access the OS and corrupt the device. SELinux is used to enforce
    **Mandatory Access Control** (**MAC**) over all of the processes, including the
    ones running with root privileges. SELinux operates on the principle of *default
    denial*. Anything that isn''t explicitly allowed is denied. SELinux can operate
    in one of two global modes: permissive mode, in which permission denials are logged
    but not enforced, and enforcing mode, in which denials are both logged and enforced.
    As per Google''s documentation, in the Android 5.0 Lollipop release, Android moves
    to full enforcement of SELinux. This builds upon the permissive release of 4.3
    and the partial enforcement of 4.4\. In short, Android is shifting from enforcement
    on a limited set of crucial domains (`installd`, `netd`, `vold`, and `zygote`)

    through proxies on the client side and stubs on the server side. The proxies and

    is assigned a token. This token is a 32-bit value and is unique across all processes
    in the system. A client can start interacting with the service after discovering
    this value, which can be done with the help of Binder's context manager. Basically,
    the context manager acts as a name service providing the handle of a service using
    the name of this service. In order to get this process working, each service must
    be registered with the context manager. Hence, a client needs to know only the
    name of a service to communicate.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The name is resolved by the context manager and the client receives the token
    that is later used for communicating with the service. The Binder driver adds
    the UID and the PID value of the sender process to each transaction. As discussed
    earlier, each application in the system has its own UID and hence this value is
    used to identify the calling party. The receiver of the call may check the obtained
    values and decide if the transaction should be completed. Hence, the security
    is enforced and the Binder token acts as a security token as it is unique across
    all of the processes.

- en: Understanding the boot process of an Android device will help us to understand
    other forensic techniques that involve interacting with the device at various
    levels. When an Android device is first powered on, there is a sequence of steps
    that are executed, helping the device to load the necessary firmware, OS, application
    data, and so on into memory. The following information is compiled from the original
    post published at [https://community.nxp.com/docs/DOC-102546](https://community.nxp.com/docs/DOC-102546).

    OS such as application sandboxing and permission models safeguard the device from
    various threats and pose as an obstacle for forensic experts during an investigation.
    With this knowledge of Android internals, we will discuss more about what data
    is stored on the device and how it is stored in the next chapter.
