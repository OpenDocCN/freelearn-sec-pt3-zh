    is more worrying is the amount of sensitive data that can be recovered from the
    lost or stolen devices. Users tend to keep lots of personal information in mobile
    devices. Passwords, bank information, social security numbers, and even confidential
    information belonging to corporations can be stolen from these devices. Alongside
    these, mobile devices are normally logged in to several email accounts, social
    media accounts, and sensitive systems. When the device is accessed by unauthorized
    people, sensitive data could be stolen and the logged-in accounts could be used

    and systems. The cost benefits that have been realized from cloud computing have
    seen quite a number of organizations adopting it. However, there have been several
    fears about the technology that have possibly held back organizations from fully
    adopting it. Organizations are not quite ready to trust third-party cloud vendors
    with sensitive data. The organizations that have put out their data on the cloud
    want to ensure that it is safe and cannot be accessed by unauthorized parties,
    and this includes the cloud platform vendors.

    cannot be manipulated by third parties. You will also ensure that the data stored
    on the cloud is secure and cannot be accessed by unauthorized parties. You will
    ensure that authentication and authorization to databases and systems are strict,
    so that stolen credentials cannot be used to access it. Lastly, you will have

    Data Protection Regulation** (**GDPR**), which is quite demanding for organizations
    that want to be fully compliant with its requirements. The consequence of non-compliance
    with GDPR is that organizations found culpable will be heavily fined. GDPR is
    just one of the many regulations in cyberspace that have been designed to protect
    privacy and ensure security. There are many other regulations that apply to different
    jurisdictions. In the US, there is the **HIPAA Act**, the **Gramm-Leach-Bliley
    Act**, and the **Federal Information Security Act**, which regulate the collection,
    use, and protection of data in healthcare, financial, and federal agencies. There

    The problem with data is that it can move across several regions and be subject

    to EU citizens, organizations world over have to comply with it, since they cannot

    information about a user, target them with a social engineering attack, and take
    advantage of the user when he or she has fallen prey to the attack. Commonly,
    social engineering allows hackers to steal login credentials to highly secure
    systems, or directly steal data and funds by ordering the users to make unauthorized
    transactions. Lastly, the penetration testing course trains students on how to
    steal data from mobile devices. It might seem as though the course might lead

    of systemsâ€”it is built within every part of the system. This makes it hard for
    malicious persons to compromise the system. During software development, developers
    have security in mind and they continually share their insights on security threats
    and how they can make their software resistant to the threats. For instance, if
    the known threat takes advantage of a one-time authentication procedure, the developers
    can implement authentication at every module of a software so that an unauthorized
    person is not able to carry out any significant transactions in a system, even
    after bypassing the initial authentication process.

    With UBA, big data analytics is used to map the normal user behaviors. For instance,
    finance department employees could be recorded to transact certain amounts of
    money to specific accounts and at certain dates. When an anomalous behavior is
    recorded from a certain user, a red flag is triggered by the system. For instance,
    if the account of a finance department employee makes abnormally large transactions
    or transacts at abnormal times, the UBA will send an alert and prevent the transaction
    from going through. This, therefore, stops an attack from being actualized.

    response teams are not always well-informed about an attack to be able to quickly
    identify the cause, mitigate it to prevent adverse impacts, and to remediate the
    situation. Even after an attack has ended, the normal incidence response personnel
    cannot assure that they can prevent a future similar attack from happening. EDR
    is a term that's used to refer to the combination of tools that are used to detect
    and investigate incidences on endpoints.
  prefs: []

    more reliable and timely incidence responses during attacks. EDR is not just one
    toolâ€”it is composed of different tools that continually monitor endpoints, networks,
    and users regarding where they centrally store all important information.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: EDR is powered by powerful analytics systems that run from a central point to
    identify any peculiar data recorded by the monitoring agents running in different
    systems. When a security incident is about to happen, the EDR will give an early
    warning to system and network admins about a potential attack. For instance, the
    EDR could detect that a server's internal firewall has continually blocked suspicious
    traffic streaming from a certain source. The EDR will warn of an imminent attack
    on the specific server so that preventative measures can be taken. Some EDRs can
    integrate with other security software, such as antivirus programs that can be
    used to intervene in cases where malware is detected to have been passed to an
    endpoint.

    continuous monitoring to deter attacks and assist with incidence response. The
    technology has been marked as an essential component of today's cybersecurity
    infrastructure. Since attacks are going to keep increasing, organizations will
    want to have a tool that can help incidence response teams during attacks to quickly
    identify the cause and mitigate it. They will, therefore, be looking for professionals
    that can deploy EDR to their IT infrastructure. Also, knowledge of the EDR technology
