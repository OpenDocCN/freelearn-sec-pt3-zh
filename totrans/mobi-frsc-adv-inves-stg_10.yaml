- en: Two-factor authentication is probably the best security feature since passwords
    were invented. Two-factor authentication goes a long way towards protecting one's
    accounts against being hacked. A password alone, no matter how long or secure,
    is no longer enough to provide sufficient protection. Social engineering, linked
    security breaches ([http://blog.elcomsoft.com/2013/02/yahoo-dropbox-and-battle-net-hacked-stopping-the-chain-reaction/](http://blog.elcomsoft.com/2013/02/yahoo-dropbox-and-battle-net-hacked-stopping-the-chain-reaction/)),
    leaked passwords, and hacked mailboxes all contribute to the insecurity of password-based
    protection. Once the intruder gets a hold of someone's password, they can access
    the account without a fuss. Even worse, they can gain access to other accounts
    by, for example, using a hacked e-mail address to request password resets on other
    connected services. Two-factor authentication aims to address this problem.

    copy of Elcomsoft Phone Breaker. Should Apple enforce two-factor authentication
    on iCloud account holders, the problem would probably occur on a much lesser scale.
    Even though two-factor authentication is not infallible and is susceptible to
    social engineering, it does require significantly greater effort to obtain a quickly
    expiring security code from the victim, and poses a much higher risk to an attacker.

    device or app that was previously authorized to generate authentication codes.

    chips as their main storage. A flash-friendly file system called `f2fs` was used
    for wear leveling. Since Android 2.3 and in all later versions, the overwhelming
    majority of Android smartphones use eMMC storage. Typically, the data partition
    is formatted with one of the Linux file systems such as `ext3` or `ext4`, but
    `f2fs` is also frequently encountered. In the past, the YAFFS2 file system was
    also a common choice. Several Samsung models used RFS, a FAT-based file system.

- en: While SD cards are equipped with an integrated storage controller, the built-in
    controllers are of a simple variety. While supporting data remapping, SD card
    controllers do not implement trim, which means that deleted data will remain available
    in unallocated areas, just like on most USB drives. The same acquisition methods
    that work for USB flash drives will work for SD cards. SDHC cards (up to and including
    32 GB) are typically formatted with FAT32\. Do note that larger SDXC cards (64
    GB and up) come pre-formatted with exFAT, and will require a carving tool supporting
    that file system.

    microSD cards as opposed to standard-size SD cards. microSD are built to different
    specifications compared to standard-size SD cards. In particular, microSD cards
    do not support the **flash erase** command, meaning no background collection and
    no automatic wiping of released data blocks.

- en: A special case (accessing deleted data on mobile platforms) applies to information
    stored inside SQLite databases. SQLite is a universally accepted database format
    employed by countless system and third-party apps running on all popular mobile
    platforms. Android and iOS keep call logs, message history, Web browsing logs,
    and many system settings in SQLite databases. Applications such as Chrome, Firefox,
    Skype, WhatsApp, and countless others also use SQLite.

    databases may not immediately disappear. In a naive attempt to counter forensic
    efforts, users may clear call history, delete message logs, and clear the browsing
    history. These measures may not be as effective as users think.

- en: The reason for these measures being unreliable is the way in which SQLite deletes
    records. Due to performance considerations, SQLite does not wipe deleted records
    (which can be quite big) unless flushed. Instead, the actual data is not moved
    anywhere. SQLite modifies pointers to deleted records to manifest that those records
    are now stored in a so-called **freelist**. By using a forensic SQLite analysis
    tool (for example, Belkasoft Evidence Center or Elcomsoft Phone Viewer), one can
    access and parse the database container, successfully extracting deleted records
    from the freelist and viewing them along with existing data.

    the illusion of privacy, while in fact deleted records may not immediately disappear.
    Instead, these records might be placed into a freelist. Records can be kept in
    the freelist for a long time—much longer in fact than most users realize because
    new calls and text messages that could potentially trigger a cleanup are relatively
    infrequent.

    when acquiring mobile devices. We reviewed SD card encryption and learned about
    the issues of unallocated space in flash-based storage media. We also reviewed
    the differences between two-factor authentication methods implemented in all major
    mobile ecosystems. The next chapter will present case studies and list forensic
    tools that can be used to acquire and analyze mobile devices.
