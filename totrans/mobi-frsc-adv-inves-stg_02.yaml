    There is no single universal acquisition method available to all models. Some
    acquisition methods depend on the phone's lock and encryption status, OS version,
    type of available storage, and so on. You'll have to work your way through the
    investigation to discover what acquisition methods are available for a particular
    device.

    cloud. Depending on the platform, cloud backups may contain as much as the full
    content of the device complete with the call histories and messages (Apple iOS
    7.x through 9.x, Windows RT, and Windows 8/8.1/10); as little as a list of installed
    applications and a few random settings (Android 4.4 and Android 5.x); or something
    in between (Windows Phone 8 and Android 6.0).

- en: Password-protected iTunes backups (Apple iOS) are encrypted; the expert will
    have to supply the correct password in order to decrypt the backup. If the password
    is not known, the expert can perform an attack (brute-force, dictionary, or combination)
    in order to recover the password. When analyzing password-protected Apple backups,
    experts can access items from the Apple keychain. Offline backups created without
    a password will be unencrypted for the most part; however, the keychain will be
    encrypted with a hardware key, meaning that no keychain data will be available.
    Making the (unlocked) iOS device produce an offline backup is a viable acquisition
    method. If possible, try to ensure that a backup with a known password is created
    (if backup password is not set, creating one before making the backup will ensure
    that the keychain items can be decrypted).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Backup passwords, if enabled, are more of a property of the actual iOS device
    rather than the backup itself. If backup password protection is enabled, the backup
    is encrypted on the iOS device before any data leaves the device. Once backup
    encryption is enabled, no unencrypted data leaves the device regardless of the
    tool used to make the backup. In other words, Apple iTunes is not actually creating
    backups; instead, the tool receives an encrypted data stream and saves it to a
    file.

    and password are known, or by serving a government request.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Similar to Apple iOS, BlackBerry 10 devices encrypt their backups internally.
    No unencrypted data leaves the device. So, when the user creates a backup via
    BlackBerry Link or a different tool (for example, Sachesi or Darcy's BlackBerry
    Tools), the backup tool just passes a command to the BlackBerry device. The device
    handles the encryption internally and streams the encrypted data flow to BlackBerry
    Link (or an alternative tool). It is important to note that unencrypted data never
    leaves the device regardless of what tool is used.

- en: The platform offers a limited capability for creating offline backups via the
    command line (`adb backup`). However, ADB backups may include a limited amount
    of data compared to iTunes backups. Due to Android fragmentation, manufacturers
    have control over what does and does not become part of the backup. As a result,
    some devices may back up call history, contacts, and text messages, while some
    other devices won't. As an example, Samsung, Sony, and HTC often omit call history,
    contacts, and text messages, while allowing Google Chrome data to be backed up
    (which, for example, will contain cached passwords and browsing history). We will
    discuss more on the Android logical acquisition via ADB backup in [Chapter 4](ch04.html

    and instructed to produce a full Nandroid backup.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    a Nandroid backup. Installing a custom recovery (if it's not yet installed) requires
    an unlocked bootloader (or a bootloader hack) and/or rooting the device. Note

    the device. This Android security measure can be bypassed in certain cases via

    For unencrypted devices, unallocated space will be extracted together with the
    filesystem, allowing experts to carve the dump for destroyed evidence. Encrypted
    devices handle unallocated space differently. For example, Apple iOS always uses
    full-disk encryption that does not keep encryption keys to released data blocks.
    As a result, unallocated areas can be accessed, but cannot be decrypted in Apple
    devices even if the device is jailbroken and the passcode is known.

    is backward-compatible with 32-bit devices and can be used instead of the full
    32-bit acquisition process if there is an error acquiring the device. However,
    the 64-bit process is highly invasive; it modifies the content of user and system
    partitions. Instead of a DMG image, the 64-bit process returns a TAR file of the
    filesystem (files and folders only). Finally, keychain items are acquired, but
    cannot be decrypted via the 64-bit process even if the passcode is known.

    expert to use a well-equipped lab. As such, forensic experts tend to try JTAG
    acquisition after other methods prove unsuccessful.

- en: Chip-off acquisition is a highly advanced, destructive extraction technique
    that requires attaching wire leads to the PCB contacts or physically removing
    (desoldering) the phone's flash memory chip. Chip-off is considered more difficult
    compared to JTAG; however, the amount of information acquired via chip-off acquisition
    is similar to the amount of data acquired by JTAGging the device. Since most smartphones
    use standard eMMC flash modules, the process is standardized and typically presents
    no surprises to the examiner.

    as possible. In the world of mobile forensic, the lowest-level access is not always
    the best. While reading the chips directly produces a complete raw dump of the
    memory chips, the investigator may be faced with an encrypted partition with no
    decryption keys stored anywhere around. In the case of Apple devices, many Samsung
    phones, and other devices (for example, the Android 5 Nexus line), encryption
    is enforced out-of-the-box. This forced encryption cannot be bypassed during low-level
    acquisition or by attacking the offline image even if you know the correct passcode.
    Сhip-off acquisition delivers the best result when used on unencrypted devices.

    encryption out-of-the-box. It's also useless on encrypted BlackBerry 10 devices;
    however, BlackBerry 10 does not enforce encryption and does not enable it out-of-the-box,
    so the encryption status of BB10 smartphones should be confirmed on a case-by-case
    basis.

    of chip-off acquisition. ISP is an advanced acquisition process that is in between
    JTAG and chip-off. During the acquisition process, examiners can attempt to dump
    the content of the eMMC memory without removing the chip. ISP acquisition is only
    available for devices utilizing eMMC or eMCP-style **ball grid array** (**BGA**)
    chips. Access to the memory is obtained through access points around the BGA chip.
    This acquisition process is considered non-destructive in that, if all stars align,
    the device can be reassembled and booted after the extraction.'

    Encrypted devices are better left to other acquisition techniques, meaning that
    no Apple smartphone or tablet can be acquired via ISP. Technically, the technique
    can be used on an Apple iOS device; however, decrypting the data partition will
    not be possible.

    from fairly easy logical and cloud extraction to expert-level and labor-intensive
    chip-off. We also reviewed the acquisition methods that are available on the various
    mobile platforms, and learned about the strengths and limitations of each method.
    Starting with the next chapter, we'll closely look at each mobile platform. The
    next chapter will provide detailed technical information on acquiring mobile devices
    running the Android OS.
