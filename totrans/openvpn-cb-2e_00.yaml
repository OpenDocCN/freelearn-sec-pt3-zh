- en: OpenVPN is one of the world's most popular packages for setting up a Virtual
    Private Network (VPN). OpenVPN provides an extensible VPN framework that has been
    designed to ease site-specific customization, such as providing the capability
    to distribute a customized installation package to clients or supporting alternative
    authentication methods via OpenVPN's plugin module interface. It is widely used
    by many individuals and companies, and some service providers even offer OpenVPN
    access as a service to users in remote, unsecured environments.
