The processes of locating and recovering digital evidence relating to records of personal communications, including e-mails and browsing records stored in computer devices and telephonic communications stored on mobile phones, are described. You will appreciate the value of locating, extracting, and examining records of communications between persons of interest stored on computer and mobile phones that are often a rich source of evidence.</p><p>The chapter will provide you with a basic understanding of the following concepts:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The recovery of Internet browsing and search records and other messaging systems including Skype and virtual private networks</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">E-mail analysis and the processing of large e-mail databases</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Mobile phone forensics and the growing challenge of evidence acquisition from personal computing devices, including tablet and GPS devices</li></ul></div><p>A range of Internet browsers are available for desktop and laptop devices as well as for tablets and other handheld devices, including Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Microsoft Internet Explorer and, more recently, Microsoft Edge, Safari, and a range of others. The value of data stored as a result of using browsers is outlined in the next section and in the <span class="emphasis"><em>The growing challenge of evidence recovery from mobile phones and handheld devices</em></span> section.</p><div class="section" title="Locating evidence from Internet browsing"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl1sec60"/>Locating evidence from Internet browsing</h1></div></div></div><p>Information relating<a id="id591" class="indexterm"/> to the web-browsing activities of a user are often found stored as cookies, cache files, URL history, search terms, histories, and other files on the computer. This forms an important part of many forensic examinations, as it can help reconstruct a suspect's online browsing behavior in relation to cases such as infringements of intellectual property, cybercrime and child pornography, and other serious crimes. The following subsections describe some of the basic features of web-browsing events that assist in crime reconstruction. They also outline the recovery of evidence from browser data, which may be done from unallocated space as well, providing the practitioner with an insight into private browsing activities.</p><div class="section" title="Typical web-browsing behavior"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec131"/>Typical web-browsing behavior</h2></div></div></div><p>Typical browsing activities<a id="id592" class="indexterm"/> involve searches for specific topics stored on websites, such as a person, event, organization, or e-mail or messaging account—virtually anything that the searcher is looking for. During the process of visiting or linking to a remote site, there is, as per <span class="emphasis"><em>Locard's exchange principle</em></span>, some exchange of data: traces are left behind and some are transferred to another device. The remote website may record some details of user visits to a varying extent. Web-based e-mail servers such as Hotmail and Yahoo! would log account holders and often record their IP addresses at the point of accessing their accounts. This information is useful in reconstructing transgressions, even more so if they correlate with the device used by the account holder to sign in to an account.</p><p>Gmail, for example, stores e-mail messages on its cloud server and not on local machines, so it is unlikely that much e-mail evidence will be recovered from these accounts, other than what may be in the transient RAM state. However, such e-mail accounts can now <a id="id593" class="indexterm"/>be synchronized and backed up into a <span class="strong"><strong>Post Office Protocol</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>POP</strong></span>) client, a standard protocol to retrieve and manage messages from remote servers over an Internet connection. This results in messages being downloaded and stored on the local machine. Windows 10 e-mail messaging similarly caches these messages on the local drive, thereby potentially assisting forensic recovery.</p><p>Browsing records are often cached on the user's local machine. For example, the default browser setting will record browsing activities in a number of different forms, most notably:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Cached folders storing HTML and multimedia files of webpages visited</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">History databases of webpages visited and, to some extent, the date and time of a range of times in which an individual webpage was visited</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">A database record of searches made using applications such as Google and Bing</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Cookie stores that record websites visited and the timestamps of each visit</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Records of online accounts visited by users</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">E-commerce activities, including e-banking records and accounts</li></ul></div><p>Forensic tools <a id="id594" class="indexterm"/>process common file types that could contain useful evidential material. Many of these small database files require deconstruction, including history databases and image thumbnail database <code class="literal">.db</code> files, <code class="literal">index.dat</code> and other such files that record Internet history, and so forth. The following table shows a collection of image and Shockwave files recovered from the Firefox default cache and a default temporary folder located in a suspect's laptop. This information formed part of the evidence to bring charges against the suspect and helped establish browsing activities during a relevant period relating to the main charge. The table shows recovered image and media files from the browser cache and the default <code class="literal">temp</code> folder.</p><div class="informaltable"><table border="1"><colgroup><col style="text-align: left"/><col style="text-align: left"/><col style="text-align: left"/><col style="text-align: left"/><col style="text-align: left"/><col style="text-align: left"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th style="text-align: left" valign="bottom">

Windows Event Viewer did provide evidence of its earlier installation and use during specific periods. This was reinforced by the remnants of Skype activity recovered from slack space, including message text and the search for an uninstallation process. A partially recovered webpage located in slack space provided an approximate period when the webpage was created on the website. Such corroboration of these scattered remnants is useful in reconstructing key events.</p><p>In this case, it was an attempt to remove Skype and data associated with it and could be considered potentially incriminating:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04931_08_06.jpg" alt="Recovering browsing artifacts from slack and unallocated space"/><div class="caption"><p>The nexus between data recovered from slack space to assist event reconstruction and an attempt to obfuscate the use of Skype</p></div></div><p>ILookIX includes <a id="id600" class="indexterm"/>a shortcut feature that takes commonly used values, such as the most recently typed web addresses in Internet Explorer and Internet Explorer settings, and regenerates those hives, keys, and values into a shortcut tree for easy review, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04931_08_07.jpg" alt="Recovering browsing artifacts from slack and unallocated space"/><div class="caption"><p>Activity antecedents recovered from the Registry</p></div></div></div><div class="section" title="Private browsing"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec133"/>Private browsing</h2></div></div></div><p>Private browsing is <a id="id601" class="indexterm"/>a facility provided by some web browsers, including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Internet Explorer, for the purpose of avoiding all traces of the user's activity during a browsing session for privacy and, possibly, security reasons. It is also typical of users wishing to hide browsing activities that involve a degree of illegality. This makes the analysis and location of evidence relating to web browsing activity potentially difficult, as the private browsing may have removed all evidence of browsing activities that may be relevant to an examination.</p><p>Research was undertaken by me to gain a clearer understanding of the nature of the private browsing function and its implications for forensic examination. Previous research had looked at recovering browsing data from computer hard drives, while other research stressed the wisdom of recording browsing activities from RAM data stored on the computer. A range of forensic programs used for the analysis of web browsers, including EnCase, AccessData's Forensic Toolkit, Nirsoft Internet Tools, and Internet Evidence Finder, had been used in earlier experiments.</p><p>My experiments were intended to identify those areas of the computer system that are modified or accessed during normal and private browsing sessions. This showed that during private browsing, IE stored everything normally but deleted it once the browser was exited. Chrome modified the safe browsing databases, cookies, and history, and Firefox modified the Firefox profiles and safe browsing database. These results could potentially help researchers focus their search when analyzing web browsers.</p><p>Some <a id="id602" class="indexterm"/>variances were noted in whether <code class="literal">pagefile.sys</code> files contained information relevant to private browsing, but that may have been due to the size of RAM available, as memory swap files are created when the memory is fully used, storing data on the hard drive. This seems more of a matter of chance than something that can be relied upon during a dead analysis of the hard drive, with the chance of finding them decreasing as time and computer use after the session increases.</p><p>The results of experiments using ILookIX and IXImager to image and examine each browser under identical conditions on Windows 7 Ultimate showed that both Chrome and Firefox had more secure private browsing modes than Internet Explorer, with no information relating to the private browsing session other than the date changes on related files found for Firefox or Chrome. The following general observations could be made:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Google Chrome</strong></span>: Examination <a id="id603" class="indexterm"/>of the slack space, <code class="literal">pagefile.sys</code> files, unallocated spaces, and string searches for Google Chrome did not recover any artifacts.

Most information recovered was located in cache, history, and temporary Internet files as well as in unallocated space. The study found browsing information in both the usual folders and unallocated space. These differences in locations where browsing artifacts were found may be due to system, web browser version, or forensic analysis software differences. This study also found that there were differences between the number of artifacts that could be recovered after a private browsing session in Internet Explorer. This appeared to depend on the different process used to access files in private browsing, with fewer artifacts recovered when Internet Explorer was opened directly in InPrivate Browsing mode.</li></ul></div><p>These results show that while there are timestamp changes to relevant browser files that indicate a browsing event has occurred, if someone has used Firefox or Chrome for a private browsing session, the recovery of any browsing artifacts would be very difficult—impossible or unlikely at best—from a dead analysis of the hard drive, as nothing was found during this research. However, information relating to the web browser session from private browsing using Internet Explorer was recoverable. However, there was less information available when Internet Explorer had been opened directly in private browsing mode than when it had been opened in normal mode and then switched to private mode.</p><p>Microsoft Edge, a <a id="id606" class="indexterm"/>variant of Internet Explorer, also incorporates a private browsing feature, as shown in the following screenshot. Preliminary research shows that like Internet Explorer, traces of this feature do remain on the device and are recoverable:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04931_08_08.jpg" alt="Private browsing"/><div class="caption"><p>Activity antecedents recovered from the Registry</p></div></div></div></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Messaging systems"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl1sec61"/>Messaging systems</h1></div></div></div><p>There are a <a id="id607" class="indexterm"/>range of messaging applications that are installed on computers that often provide useful digital evidence about the activities, contacts, and intentions of wrongdoers. Mobile phones are increasingly used for such communications, and this is described in more detail later in the chapter.</p><p>MSN Messenger, Skype, Yahoo! Messenger, and other web-based e-mail applications are a common feature on many computers. Chat rooms that appeared destined for the scrap heap have undergone a renaissance on computers, tablets, and mobile phones because of their ease of use and general convenience. Banter, for example, enables casual chatting with others who are nearby.</p><p>Social networking sites such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google+, Flickr, and Meetup are just a few of the sites available for users to meet friends, contacts, and others with similar interests. Other sites host chat rooms catering to every form of human interest and endeavor—and not all legal or in good taste.</p><div class="section" title="Examining Skype and chat room artifacts"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec134"/>Examining Skype and chat room artifacts</h2></div></div></div><p>The<a id="id608" class="indexterm"/> following screenshot shows the file property sheet of <a id="id609" class="indexterm"/>recovered chat messages between a suspect and young persons through the social networking site <span class="strong"><strong>TeenChat</strong></span> (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.teenchat.com/">http://www.teenchat.com/</a>).

Skype, by default, leaves a collection of spreadsheets that are helpful to the investigator. In the following screenshot, there are samples of files that contain records of conversations between various parties:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04931_08_10.jpg" alt="Examining Skype and chat room artifacts"/><div class="caption"><p>Recovered files relating to Skype activity</p></div></div><p>Often, attempts <a id="id610" class="indexterm"/>are made to delete or obfuscate these communications, and in doing so, the offender may assume that the records <a id="id611" class="indexterm"/>of conversations have been permanently destroyed. However, other parties to the conversations and responsible website-hosting services may retain some of the traffic data and will be obliged by law to share this with investigation teams.</p><p>To confound law enforcement investigations, offenders will adopt anti-forensics processes that were introduced in <a class="link" href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. Windows and Other Operating Systems as Sources of Evidence">Chapter 7</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Windows and Other Operating Systems as Sources of Evidence</em></span>, including the use of the invisible Internet.</p></div><div class="section" title="The invisible Internet"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec135"/>The invisible Internet</h2></div></div></div><p>It is estimated that <a id="id612" class="indexterm"/>the World Wide Web is a small representation of networked sites, with the bulk, which some observers estimate to be well in excess of 90 percent, comprising what is termed the invisible Internet or the Deep Web. Search engines such as Google are incapable of recognizing and indexing its sites. Locating them requires some insider knowledge, a modicum of skill, and a web browser such as Tor.</p><p>The Dark Web, on the other hand, is not invisible, but the sites that host them in the background are, as they have been encrypted and hidden using special tools provided by Tor and I2P. The infamous Silk Road online drug-trafficking site used these tools to undertake its covert activities. Others use it for legitimate purposes but are keen to maintain their anonymity while browsing the web.</p><p>Obviously, locating remnants of these covert communications on devices is another challenge for practitioners, but remnants do in fact often get left behind. In the following screenshot, subject to rendition, ILookIX was able to recover some traces of Tor activity on a laptop. This information supported the likelihood that the suspect was covertly accessing illegal sex sites, among others, and was anxious for this to remain secret from other<a id="id613" class="indexterm"/> computer users. Regrettably, pedophile rings use the network to exchange illegal and obscene material and communicate with others in this disgusting traffic in the hope it will avoid detection and prosecution:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04931_08_11.jpg" alt="The invisible Internet"/><div class="caption"><p>Browsing Dark Web websites for pornography</p></div></div><p>The following screenshot shows a sample of <code class="literal">.TOR</code> files recovered from another device.

The following subsections further describe how these datasets are managed and how the practitioner may undertake a more efficacious approach to e-mail analysis and identification.</p><div class="section" title="Recovering e-mails from desktop and laptop computers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec136"/>Recovering e-mails from desktop and laptop computers</h2></div></div></div><p>In the <a id="id617" class="indexterm"/>following figure, ILookIX has deconstructed e-mail messages from a single account holding more than 28,000 e-mail messages and attachments. The files appear in a structure, reflecting the e-mail directory structure, files, and attachments as shown on the original device. This makes it easy for the practitioner to become oriented with the e-mail layout and gain a quick perspective of the mail system:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04931_08_14.jpg" alt="Recovering e-mails from desktop and laptop computers"/><div class="caption"><p>E-mail directory structure viewed in the ILookIX e-mail viewer</p></div></div><p>An <span class="strong"><strong>E-mail Stores</strong></span> file is any file that contains e-mail messages or similar data, such as the calendar and contact information in a Microsoft Outlook <code class="literal">.OST</code> or <code class="literal">.PST</code> file. This includes <code class="literal">.EML</code>, <code class="literal">.MSG</code>, <code class="literal">.NSF</code>, <code class="literal">.MBOX</code>, <code class="literal">.MBS</code>, or even <code class="literal">.HTML</code>-based e-mails. Some e-mail stores, such as <code class="literal">.EML</code> or <code class="literal">.MSG</code> files, contain a single message per file, but even these files need to be deconstructed by ILookIX for them to appear in the e-mail explorer. Each e-mail store is listed as an entry in the e-mail explorer, whether the store contains a single message, such as a <code class="literal">.EML</code> or <code class="literal">.MSG</code> file, or a complete structure of messages in folders and subfolders. such as a <code class="literal">.PST</code> file.</p><p>An<a id="id618" class="indexterm"/> important concept that must be understood is the homogenous nature of all e-mail types supported in ILookIX. All e-mail client deconstructions become part of the same basic explorer e-mail concept. This removes the differences between clients so that functions such as e-mail links can be analyzed and explored in a new, much-easier-to-decipher interface. The interface provides an object model that encompasses all of the characteristics of an Internet e-mail item using the RFC standards that apply to all Internet e-mail send/receive clients. Within this process, items such as Lotus Notes are fitted into the same model as Outlook <code class="literal">.OST</code> files—this interface comprises the explorer bar for e-mail.</p><p>The e-mail explorer takes all of the e-mail stores, such as Microsoft Outlook's <code class="literal">.PST</code> files, and shows the folder structure for each. Inside the folder structure, the practitioner may view messages, contacts, attachments, and other items, depending on the type of mailbox processed. When working with files, e-mail messages are displayed in the <span class="strong"><strong>List Pane</strong></span> by selecting an e-mail store or a subfolder in the store, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04931_08_15.jpg" alt="Recovering e-mails from desktop and laptop computers"/><div class="caption"><p>Viewing e-mails by subject</p></div></div><p>Messages may be viewed using <span class="strong"><strong>Viewer</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Hex View</strong></span>, or <span class="strong"><strong>Plain Text View</strong></span>.

They also record the position of users if they have the positioning setting activated—all in all, a considerable amount of data that may assist an investigation. For example, stored information may reveal details of the user's contacts and details of their communications relating to some transgression as well as an insight into their motivation and mindset.</p><p>The following screenshot shows a report of items and deleted items regarding the activity of the phone user, including messages, calls, locations, and browsing activities:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04931_08_25.jpg" alt="The growing challenge of evidence recovery from mobile phones and handheld devices"/><div class="caption"><p>A general forensic report of mobile phone accounts and files</p></div></div><p>However, mobile phones <a id="id634" class="indexterm"/>pose challenges to the forensic practitioner, especially with the rapid development of new phone types and operating systems with increased reliance on protection and encryption that effectively challenges evidence recovery. The rapid growth of mobile phones using different hardware and operating systems has made it difficult to develop a single process or tool to address all eventualities. In addition to a growing variety of smartphones and platforms, including Android, Blackberry, Apple iPhone, and Windows Mobile, there is a staggering range of inexpensive phones using legacy systems. The following section provides an outline of evidence recovery from mobile phones.</p><div class="section" title="Extracting data from mobile devices"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec139"/>Extracting data from mobile devices</h2></div></div></div><p>Evidence <a id="id635" class="indexterm"/>of different types of files is stored in mobile phones and may be found in several locations, including device memory, detachable memory such as SD cards, and removable SIM cards.</p><p>Each mobile phone is provided with a usually unique identifier known as the <span class="strong"><strong>International Mobile Station Equipment Identity</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>IMEI</strong></span>) to uniquely identify a broad range <a id="id636" class="indexterm"/>of mobile phones. The unique number is normally printed inside the battery compartment or on the outside casing of the phone. It is also stored inside the embedded memory of the phone and, from there, may be displayed on the screen and recovered using forensic tools. The IMEI identifies and validates the phone hardware to a GSM network to prevent stolen phones from accessing that network. The IMEI is an important record of a phone's use and identity.</p><p>In the <a id="id637" class="indexterm"/>following screenshot, the XRY Micro Systemation forensic tool has extracted general information about an iPhone 4, including its IMEI number. The SIM identification number is recorded at the bottom of the report:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04931_08_26.jpg" alt="Extracting data from mobile devices"/><div class="caption"><p>Forensic report of an iPhone 4 showing the basic device settings</p></div></div><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note12"/>Note</h3><p>Subscribers are identified by another unique identifier: the IMEI number stored on the SIM card, which identifies and authenticates subscribers. This facilitates a practitioner liaising with the telephone network to obtain billing information, locations of calls, and contacts—all potential evidence.</p></div></div><p>Among <a id="id638" class="indexterm"/>practitioners, it is considered best practice to document manual and technical processes used to access and recover evidence from mobile phones and to minimize any loss or changes to data. Android and Apple phones and a host of others store a significant amount of user information in SQLite databases—information which sometimes remains on the device after other information has been deleted. This can be a useful source of information, and forensic tools often recover a broad range of file types, including databases.</p><p>In the following screenshot, the mobile forensic tool NowSecure Mobile Forensics was used to recover information from an Android mobile phone.

Records of its location when making and receiving calls can also be obtained:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04931_08_38.jpg" alt="Extracting data from mobile devices"/><div class="caption"><p>Recovered map showing the location of the phone</p></div></div><p>In the<a id="id646" class="indexterm"/> following screenshot, a new location has been recorded, showing the position of the phone approaching a major road intersection:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04931_08_39.jpg" alt="Extracting data from mobile devices"/><div class="caption"><p>Recovered map showing location of the phone during transit</p></div></div><p>The following table is an extract of chat messages recorded on an iPhone that was used to rebut an allegation of rape by the spouse.

Regrettably, the phone did not provide any further information to assist either party to the dispute:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04931_08_41.jpg" alt="Extracting data from mobile devices"/><div class="caption"><p>Chat messages and voicemail notifications relating to a civil dispute over the deceased's will</p></div></div><p>Mobile devices store information and system and application files on solid-state drives, which are small, compact, and physically durable. This format is similar to that of tablet devices and small laptops or netbooks such as Windows Surface Pro, Apple's MacBook Air and Asus netbooks. This and the security encryption of these devices is presently making it problematic to image the devices during a bootup process. A research team associated with me is presently working on a solution and has had some success in making logical copies of Apple desktops and Window's Surface Pro laptops using ISeek technology to recover evidence otherwise difficult to locate and recover.</p><p>Mobile phones <a id="id648" class="indexterm"/>and tablets are heavily restricted in the amount of data they can store, on average holding a mere 32 to 64 gigabytes of data. The deletion processes on these drives use wear leveling to ensure efficient removal of data in order to maximize the life of the drive. That means that although deleted data may not be evident, it may persist longer on the device, potentially offering more chance of recovery using a physical dump of the deleted sectors. Conversely, the wear leveling and delete feature tends to activate when the phone is switched on and therefore this should be avoided post seizure. Physical extractions from Android phones and iPhones have been thwarted by the security of the devices and unwillingness of phone vendors to assist practitioners in their legitimate endeavors to recover evidence.</p><p>Law enforcement agencies process large amounts of telephone intercept data as well as compiling databases of suspects and organized crime syndicates. Processing data recovered from a single device can be time-consuming, but processing a larger number of phones to reconstruct crime events and relationships between suspects is even more so. Sophisticated forensic tools such as Cellebrite and XRY Micro Systemation can filter out irrelevant material from these large collections. These and other tools create relationship diagrams and timelines that assist in reconstructing criminal activities and speedily identifying groups of critical evidence.</p><p>Modern mobile forensic tools offer a range of labor-saving functions, such as preparing relationship matrices, reports, data collation reports, and timelines. The timeline shown in the following screenshot, produced by the NewSecure ViaExtract forensic tool, assists the practitioner in overviewing the nature of evidence and key events and filtering data to create meaningful timelines:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04931_08_42.jpg" alt="Extracting data from mobile devices"/><div class="caption"><p>Timeline of key activities recovered from a mobile phone</p></div></div><p>Some <a id="id649" class="indexterm"/>mobile forensics tools, such as MobileEdit, can retrieve mobile backup files from computers used to synchronize iPhones that have passcode-access security enabled. The iTunes application installed on a computer is intended to synchronize music but, by default, the application stores lockdown files of the previously connected iPhone. This is a handy process to use if the phone passcode is unknown but the practitioner has access to the computer or Mac that was used to previously synchronize the specific iPhone. By locating and copying the <code class="literal">lockdown.plist</code> file, it can be used with the forensic tool to access a locked iPhone.</p><p>These iTunes folders are typically stored at the following locations:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Windows 10: <code class="literal">C:\ProgramData\Apple\Lockdown</code></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Mac OS X: <code class="literal">/var/db/lockdown</code></li></ul></div><p>Other tools are capable of recovering user access PIN codes by brute force attacks and can also identify the screen swipe access path to allow access to a locked phone.</p></div><div class="section" title="Managing evidence contamination"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec140"/>Managing evidence contamination</h2></div></div></div><p>Conventional <a id="id650" class="indexterm"/>dead imaging of desktop devices is possible but usually impractical for mobile phones. Removing the internal drive is technically challenging and increasingly impractical. External devices and SIM cards, however, may be removed and the contents copied and analyzed with the appropriate tools.</p><p>Care<a id="id651" class="indexterm"/> should be taken to isolate a mobile phone to prevent it communicating with its telephone provider and local Wi-Fi and Bluetooth services. Removal of the SIM card prevents communication with the telephone provider, but if the device is switched on during recovery, then it is wise to do so in a laboratory insulated from wireless communications—a Faraday bag or container is another favorite protection option. Using the device's flight mode will also isolate the phone from interference, but the practitioner needs to locate this feature speedily to prevent interference.</p><p>Mobile phone operating systems can be adversely affected by low battery levels and extremes of temperature, dust, and humidity. It is not uncommon for a device to fail or its connection points to corrode or be affected by static electricity charges causing connection problems.</p><p>Mobile phones and certain other handheld devices can be remotely accessed by their owners to locate a lost or stolen device and also to "kill" the phone by deleting private information and resetting it to its factory default state or permanently locking the phone. This may frustrate the thief but it also prevents the practitioner from recovering evidence.</p><p>There are some differences, although these are tending to become more blurred, between recovering data from desktop and laptop computers and handheld devices, most notably the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The devices are connected to communications networks such as telecommunication systems and Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connections</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Information stored on the devices can be lost completely as it is susceptible to being overwritten by new data or remote destruction commands it receives over wireless networks</li></ul></div><p>Additionally, to extract information from a mobile device, the device must be switched on to enable live evidence recovery. This may result in the contamination or destruction of some data stored on the device. Forensic tools will often place a small executable file on the device and may also include some alteration to developer options on Android devices, for example. In the following diagram, the developer options of an Android phone are being manually changed before pairing with the forensic software and computer:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04931_08_43.jpg" alt="Managing evidence contamination"/><div class="caption"><p>Preparing an Android phone for pairing with the forensic tool</p></div></div><p>In the <a id="id652" class="indexterm"/>following example, the settings of an Android phone have been manually modified to permit forensic recovery of the phone data:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04931_08_44.jpg" alt="Managing evidence contamination"/><div class="caption"><p>An Android phone being paired with the forensic tool</p></div></div><p>As seen in the following screenshot, the forensic tool is commencing the pairing process with an iPhone:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04931_08_45.jpg" alt="Managing evidence contamination"/><div class="caption"><p>An iPhone being paired with the forensic tool</p></div></div></div><div class="section" title="Concealing illegal activities"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec141"/>Concealing illegal activities</h2></div></div></div><p>While <a id="id653" class="indexterm"/>law enforcement agencies have successfully prosecuted many criminals using digital evidence recovered from mobile phones, the trend is now reversing. Mobile phones are strongly encrypted and some RIM Blackberry and burner phones are so well protected that it is often not possible to recover any evidence. Some criminals use multiple SIM cards and/or prepaid mobile devices that are used for short periods. This effectively denies practitioners access to any billing or other tracking information associated with normal usage that is provided by telephone network providers:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04931_08_46.jpg" alt="Concealing illegal activities"/><div class="caption"><p>A RIM BlackBerry 9320 Curve, typically used for secure covert e-mailing</p></div></div></div><div class="section" title="Extracting mobile data from the cloud"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec142"/>Extracting mobile data from the cloud</h2></div></div></div><p>The <a id="id654" class="indexterm"/>cloud is also becoming a valuable source of digital evidence from mobile phone backup storage as well as social media accounts, such as Facebook, Twitter, and Kik. Cellebrite, for example, provides a forensic process capable of recovering private user data from these types of sites under appropriate legal sanction. This includes logging in to these user accounts with user identification and passwords previously retrieved from other data held by suspects. The process protects the recovered data from contamination during the recovery process and holds it in a forensic state for further examination.</p></div><div class="section" title="Analyzing GPS devices and other handheld devices"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec143"/>Analyzing GPS devices and other handheld devices</h2></div></div></div><p>GPS <a id="id655" class="indexterm"/>networks are used to navigate and look at various global locations. They form an essential part of mobile phone features, as described previously, and are now commonly installed in the dashboard of motor vehicles, replacing the standalone units attached to windscreens or holders.</p><p>Handheld devices, including <a id="id656" class="indexterm"/>satellite phones, tablets, and netbooks, also store a limited amount of historical information about the locations visited by the device and timestamps showing that the device was at a specific location. The EXIF data posted to social media sites can also contain information about approximately where the photograph was taken. More advanced mobile forensic tools can verify whether the photograph was taken on the mobile device using what is called <a id="id657" class="indexterm"/>
<span class="strong"><strong>camera ballistics processes</strong></span>. Digital book readers, such as Kindle, are also subject to forensic examination as they have been found to conceal evidentiary material.</p><p>Obtaining data from tablets and other handhelds is relatively straightforward and similar to computers and mobile phones. They provide useful data for evidence reconstruction. GPS devices are becoming more problematic to retrieve data from, particularly those inbuilt in vehicle dashboards. More often than not, the device provides no more data than the home location and locations keyed in as potential destinations. They do not generally record the journey and any meaningful chronology of the journey, but they can add to an investigation by corroborating mobile phone records and Telco logging.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Case study &#x2013; mobile phone evidence in a bomb hoax"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl1sec64"/>Case study – mobile phone evidence in a bomb hoax</h1></div></div></div><p>This <a id="id658" class="indexterm"/>case study further exemplifies how digital evidence should always be corroborated, verified whenever possible, and certainly never taken at face value.</p><p>The defendant in the case was charged with serious offences under telecommunications legislation relating to sending a text message to the defendant's father, claiming that a bomb would detonate at the school attended by one of the defendant's siblings. The threat was reported to the local police, who in turn evacuated the school as a safety measure. A search of the school confirmed that the threat was probably a hoax, but it still was a very serious matter. Unfortunately, these hoaxes are all too common, and, in light of attacks on schools by extortionists, extremists, and persons with serious mental health issues, are always taken seriously by law enforcement and affected parties. However, they are so frequent that one can hardly blame first responders from occasionally adopting a blasé approach in apprehending the perpetrators of these hoaxes.</p><p>Prior to the incident, the defendant had been receiving a number of vexatious and sinister text messages on their mobile phone. The messages were partly written in English and partly in another Asian language. They seemed to refer to a former lover who then resided in another country. They also made derogatory comments about the defendant's fiancée, who also started receiving similar text messages.</p><p>The defendant, looking more like a victim at this point in time, received a number of sinister text messages on the mobile phone, and a sample of these is shown in the following table:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04931_08_47.jpg" alt="Case study – mobile phone evidence in a bomb hoax"/></div><p>The <a id="id659" class="indexterm"/>defendant's and their fiancée's responses to the messages seemed to goad the caller to make or send more threatening messages, including the following messages extracted from the fiancée's phone:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04931_08_48.jpg" alt="Case study – mobile phone evidence in a bomb hoax"/></div><p>Later <a id="id660" class="indexterm"/>messages to the fiancée implied a bomb threat and other sinister actions:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04931_08_49.jpg" alt="Case study – mobile phone evidence in a bomb hoax"/></div><p>The tone of these messages became even more bizarre and intimidating:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04931_08_50.jpg" alt="Case study – mobile phone evidence in a bomb hoax"/></div><p>And they <a id="id661" class="indexterm"/>continued in a similar vein:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04931_08_51.jpg" alt="Case study – mobile phone evidence in a bomb hoax"/></div><p>At this point, the defendant made a complaint to the local police about these messages and an apparent burglary at their parents' family home that the defendant shared with a younger sibling. The complaint was recorded and the police visited the home, but they noted that while the defendant's bedroom had been ransacked, nothing had evidently been stolen.</p><p>The <a id="id662" class="indexterm"/>following day, a bomb threat message was received by the defendant's father, and police took possession of the defendant's father's mobile phone and were later able to identify the subscriber number of the caller. The telephone provider provided a log of calls made between the phone and other contacts, which was restricted to the phones belonging to the defendant, the fiancée, and the father. The phone's IMEI and SIM card IMSI numbers were identified, and further inquiry confirmed that the handset belonged to the defendant, although the SIM card was purchased without identification being provided (not an uncommon occurrence).</p><p>A search of the defendant's bedroom (previously burgled) located the handset underneath the defendant's bed. As it transpired, the handset was an old phone that the defendant had purchased and later replaced with a newer model. Consequently, the defendant was questioned and then arrested, and prosecution action commenced. However, the motivation of the defendant, a respectable office worker, was not established—unusual, considering the background circumstances. Moreover, none of the preceding events leading up to the data of the bomb threat were heeded by the police, and I was engaged to seek the truth of the matter.</p><p>A reconstruction of the crime commenced with a comparison of the available prosecution evidence with the findings of defense investigation. There was no doubt as to the text message being sent from the seized handset that belonged to the defendant, but no SIM card was ever recovered. The defendant was linked to the crime by the handset, the text messages recorded on it, and the corroborating information provided by the telecommunications provider—strong evidence, but not necessarily conclusive, for motivation for the crime seemed lacking.</p><p>The following concerns were raised to the prosecutor by me through the defense legal team:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The discovery facts provided by the prosecution were lacking essential information for the defense team to make a reasonable examination of the evidence</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">There was no forensic report made of the defendant's new phone or the fiancée's phone, which contained exculpatory evidence</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Details of the forensic tools and processes used to extract data from the seized mobile phones were not provided</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Copies of the actual forensic files of the seized phones obtained through these processes were not shared in full</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Details of any Wi-Fi connectivity recovered from any of the phones were not checked and provided to the defense team</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">No details were provided of any GPS location data that may have been recovered from the perpetrator's phone, particularly relevant to the time the threatening texts were sent at</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">No details were provided of the recorded location of the seized mobile phone to determine its location through connections to telephone towers during the period from the commencement of the sinister and threatening calls received by the defendant and other parties</li></ul></div><p>The last <a id="id663" class="indexterm"/>point raised was important to answer so as to determine the location of the person who sent the bomb threat message and compare that with the location of the defendant's phone, which was active at the same time the bomb threat message was sent. The defendant claimed to be in a distant suburb at the time of the threat and had a sound and independent alibi to support the claim. If it could be shown that the threat had been sent from another location, which seemed plausible, then it could be inferred that the defendant did not have possession of the phone at the critical time.</p><p>Within a day of the prosecution being made aware of these concerns, the charges against the defendant were unexpectedly withdrawn without reason being provided. Not wishing to be overly critical of the agency involved in this case, there seemed to have been some systemic problems not uncommon with the handling of digital evidence. Certainly, the prosecution investigation was defective, incomplete, and too narrowly focused on obtaining a quick conviction at a lower court to settle what the officers may have decided was a routine nuisance call. Sloppy police work contributed to the low standard of the investigation, resulting in an overreliance on the devices seized and a failure to note or consider other digital and witness evidence.</p><p>It is unclear who the actual culprit was, but the following observations seemed to suggest it was the defendant's younger sibling, in that:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">He had access to the defendant's bedroom and could have removed and later replaced the incriminating phone under the bed after sending the threat</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">He spoke the foreign language fluently and had an intimate knowledge of the insides of the family home and the movements of family members, as reflected in the text messages</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">He suffered some form of mental illness and had a low intellect that seemed to be reflected in some of the text messages</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">He disliked the fiancée and was obsessively possessive about his parents and the defendant</li></ul></div><p>In <a id="id664" class="indexterm"/>effect, he had the means, motive, and opportunity to implicate the defendant. Curiously, the defendant appeared reluctant to provide all but the phone evidence and appeared to be protecting the sibling. That is speculation, but highly plausible, with some grounds for believing the defendant was hoping the digital evidence could successfully overturn the case without implicating the sibling.</p><p>This was an unusual case, which you may find intriguing, and while it does provide a sample of a real case, it leads on to the next chapter, which will focus on the ever-important forensic rule: seek the truth, be led by all the evidence, and do not let investigator bias hide the truth.</p></div>
<div class="section" title="Summary"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl1sec65"/>Summary</h1></div></div></div><p>This chapter provided some of the key processes for locating and recovering digital evidence relating to records of personal communications, including e-mails and browsing records stored on computer devices and telephonic communications stored on mobile phones. It outlined the recovery and searching of Internet browsing records and other messaging systems, including Skype. It described in more detail the processes of e-mail analysis and recovery.</p><p>Mobile phone forensics was introduced and its importance in forensic examinations along with the growing challenge of evidence acquisition from personal computing devices and GPS devices was explained. The case study provided an insight into some of the key issues with mobile phone evidence.

<a class="link" href="ch09.html" title="Chapter 9. Validating the Evidence">Chapter 9</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Validating the Evidence</em></span>, will reflect on the fundamentals of digital evidence analysis: a thorough examination of the evidence to test its authenticity, relevance, and reliability. You will further recognize and appreciate the importance of the scientific examination of digital devices and evidence to ensure that the best forensic practice is maintained.</p><p>In particular, the next chapter will describe some common pitfalls that diminish the value of digital forensics through cursory and biased examinations. A case study will showcase the importance of sound evidence selection and analysis as well as emphasizing the importance of impartiality in selecting evidence to ensure that the courts' expectations are met. Validating the evidence to determine its relevance and authenticity in anticipation of it being tendered in legal proceedings relies on testing and checking the evidence to ensure it is what it purports to be. This includes a more structured analysis of the evidence collected, including the development and testing of hypotheses and counter-arguments in line with forensic standards.</p></div></body></html>
