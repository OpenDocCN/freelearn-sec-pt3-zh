    The evaluation should be done using a scale that clearly defines each level. The
    most common evaluation scales are 3-level, 5-level, and +7-level scales.

- en: A 3-level scale may be very simplistic and gives you very little room for rating
    and improvement, therefore that is not the best option for you.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On the other hand, a +7-level scale may be too complex to evaluate, analyze,
    and report, and since one of the goals of a CMM is to be simple to implement,
    then this is not a good option either.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    to accurately rate a control or domain without unnecessary complications.

    them (Level 0), then the overall rate of the cybersecurity policies domain is
    0\. These results are exceptionally useful in helping you define weak areas in
