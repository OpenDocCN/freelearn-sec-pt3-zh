    applications that interact with databases. A SQL injection attack involves inserting
    malicious **Structured Query Language** (**SQL**) code into input fields or URL
    parameters. When an application fails to properly validate or sanitize user input,
    the injected SQL code executes directly in the database, which frequently results
    in unauthorized access, data manipulation, and potentially complete control over

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: XSS is a common security vulnerability in web applications. It allows attackers
    to embed malicious scripts in web pages, possibly compromising the security and
    integrity of data read by unsuspecting users. This exploit occurs when an application
    accepts and displays unvalidated or unsanitized user input. XSS attacks are prevalent
    and highly dangerous as they can affect any user interacting with the vulnerable
    web application.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Reflected XSS**: In this type of attack, the malicious script is reflected
    off the web server to the victim’s browser. It usually happens when user input
    isn’t properly validated or sanitized before being returned to the user. For instance,
    a website might have a search feature where a user can input a query. If the site
    doesn’t properly sanitize the input and directly displays it in the search results
    page URL, an attacker could input a malicious script. When another user clicks
    on that manipulated link, the script executes in their browser.'
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Stored XSS**: This type of attack involves storing a malicious script on
    the target server. It happens when user input isn’t properly sanitized before
    being saved in a database or other persistent storage. For example, if a forum
    allows users to input comments and doesn’t properly sanitize the input, an attacker
    could submit a comment containing a script. When other users view that particular
    comment, the script executes in their browsers, potentially affecting multiple
    users.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**DOM-based XSS**: This attack occurs in the DOM of a web page. The malicious
    script gets executed as a result of manipulating the DOM environment on the client
    side. It doesn’t necessarily involve sending data to the server; instead, it manipulates
    the page’s client-side scripts directly in the user’s browser. This could happen
    when a website uses client-side scripts that dynamically update the DOM based
    on user input without proper sanitization. For instance, if a web page includes
    JavaScript that takes data from the URL hash and updates the page without sanitizing
    or encoding it properly, an attacker could inject a script into the URL that gets
    executed when the page loads.'

    in the browsers of other users, potentially leading to various risks, such as
    stealing sensitive information, session hijacking, or performing unauthorized

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: SOP
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: SOP is a fundamental security concept enforced by web browsers, governing how
    documents or scripts loaded from one origin (domain, protocol, or port) can interact
    with resources from another origin. Under SOP, JavaScript running on a web page
    is typically restricted to accessing resources such as cookies, DOM elements,
    or AJAX requests from the same origin.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: SOP plays a crucial role in security by preventing unauthorized access to sensitive
    data. By restricting scripts from different origins, SOP helps mitigate risks
    such as CSRF and the theft of sensitive information.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, it’s important to note that XSS attacks inherently bypass SOP. When
    attackers inject malicious scripts into vulnerable web applications, these scripts
    execute within the context of the compromised page, allowing them to access and
    manipulate data as if they were part of the legitimate content.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While SOP is essential for web security, it has its limitations. Despite its
    protection boundaries, SOP does not prevent XSS attacks. Since the injected malicious
    script runs in the context of the compromised page, it is considered part of the
    same origin.
  prefs: []

    resources are allowed to be loaded on a web page. It mitigates XSS vulnerabilities
    by offering several features.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First, CSP enables developers to define a whitelist of trusted sources from
    which certain types of content (scripts, stylesheets, and so on) can be loaded.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Developers can specify the sources (for example, `'self'` and specific domains)
    from which scripts can be loaded and executed. Additionally, CSP allows nonces
    and hashes in script tags to ensure that only trusted scripts with specific nonces
    or hashes can execute.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Among its advantages, CSP significantly reduces the attack surface for XSS vulnerabilities
    by restricting script execution to trusted sources and blocking inline scripts.
    However, the adoption of CSP may encounter challenges such as compatibility issues
    due to existing inline scripts or non-compliant resources.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While SOP sets foundational security boundaries by limiting cross-origin interactions,
    XSS attacks exploit the context of compromised pages, bypassing these restrictions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    to define and enforce stricter policies on resource loading, mitigating XSS risks
    by limiting trusted sources for content.

- en: This chapter discussed how to use the Python programming language to detect
    and exploit vulnerabilities in web applications. We began by explaining the landscape
    of web vulnerabilities and why understanding them is critical for good security
    testing. Then, we delved into numerous forms of web vulnerabilities, such as SQL
    injection, XSS, and CSRF, explaining their mechanisms and their consequences.
    You learned how Python can be used to automate the detection and exploitation
    of these vulnerabilities through real examples and code snippets. Additionally,
    this chapter emphasized the importance of adequate validation, sanitization, and
    encoding approaches in mitigating these vulnerabilities. At this point, you are
    equipped with essential knowledge and tools to bolster the security posture of
    web applications through Python-based exploitation techniques.
