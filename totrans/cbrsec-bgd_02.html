                    <h1 class="header-title">Security Evolution â€” From Legacy to Advanced, to ML and AI</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Security has evolved over the last few decades. It started off with antivirus systems that were for a long time referred to as the ultimate cybersecurity tools. These were then joined by an array of other tools.</p>
<p>Before 1971, cybersecurity was unheard of. That is unsurprising, since computers were still being developed, were too pricey for hackers, and only a few people knew how to write code to do basic input/output functions. A researcher called Bob Thomas then discovered that it was possible to create a malicious program that could propagate from one computer to another and leave an annoying message. Following this discovery, another researcher modified the program so that it could become self-replicating. Essentially, he created the first computer worm. He then decided to build another program that could catch the malicious one and delete it from a computer, thus stopping it from replicating and spreading further. This was the world's first antivirus software.</p>
<p>However, the cybersecurity space has dramatically changed since the 1970s. Threats have become more complex and this necessitated the development of more complex security systems. Advancements in technology have offered hackers more tools and techniques with which to build threats. In addition to this, security systems are having to cover for technologies that were built without security in mind. Such technologies include the internet, which is relied on by billions of people. Therefore, cybersecurity has had to do more than evolve to respond to the cyber threats landscape; it has had to foresee and future-proof systems, users, and networks from attacks. This chapter discusses the evolution of cybersecurity and the future of the integration of cybersecurity with machine learning and artificial intelligence, and will cover the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Legacy cybersecurity systems</li>
<li>Transformations in cybersecurity</li>
<li>Advancements in security technology, and the future</li>
<li>How <strong>machine learning</strong> (<strong>ML</strong>) and <strong>artificial intelligence</strong> (<strong>AI</strong>) will play a larger role in cybersecurity</li>
</ul>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Legacy cybersecurity systems</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>As noted in our discussion of the creation of the first worm and the first antivirus, cybersecurity was initially designed as a response to a cyber threat. Legacy systems were built to secure organizations from known threats. After the discovery of a cyber threat, security experts would learn its unique execution or coding patterns. This information would be used to enable security systems to detect and stop the identified cyber threat. This tradition still continues up to the present day. There is a famed database known as <strong>Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures</strong> (<strong>CVE</strong>), where all the discovered threats are explained and a unique identification number is given to them.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Signature-based security systems</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>During the age of legacy security systems, security tools were built with the attack signatures of the many threats that had been discovered. Since the know-how for creating new malware was limited to a few, this security approach was initially effective. Individuals and organizations were meant to believe that having a single security system on a computer was good enough. These security systems were then improved to receive updates to their database where new malware signatures would be added. Therefore, users could get new updates after a certain duration or when security companies made them available.</p>
<p>The signature-based creation of cybersecurity products was applied across a whole array of defense systems, which were principally antivirus systems. Therefore, all these systems had a single point of failure: the reliance on databases of signatures. This left a vulnerability of organizations being attacked using malware or attack techniques that were not already known by their security systems. In addition, the security systems were mostly designed to prevent attacks from malware. Therefore, the threats that were covered were viruses and worms. Hackers decided to pounce on this chance and made several notable attacks.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Network cyber attacks</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>By the end of the 1970s, a sixteen-year-old called Kevin Mitnick had learned how to get unauthorized access into a network. He used this knowledge to breach the network of Digital Equipment Corp. His aim was to copy its operating system, and he was able to do just that while in the network. He was later arrested and put in solitary confinement as authorities tried to understand how he was able to gain access to one of Digital Equipment Corp's computers. The following image is a photograph from an article on Kevin Mitnick:</p>

<p>In the 1990s, the biggest hack on the US military and NASA was conducted by a tech-savvy individual called Gary McKinnon. He reportedly broke into 97 computers remotely. He then deleted critical files and the OSes of the computers, causing them to become inoperable. The computers were so important that the hack caused a shutdown of the army's network, and the cost implications of the hack reached a devastating $700,000 USD. The following is a screenshot of Gary McKinnon's Wikipedia page summary:</p>

<p>Many other hackers were gaining and improving on their skills. Even worse, new tools were discovered that could be used by non-expert hackers. They were known as <strong>exploit kits</strong>, and hackers would either buy or rent them to attack their targets. This caused a lot of pressure on the cybersecurity industry to evolve. It was clear that the initial design of tools that could detect malicious software based on attack signatures did not foresee many hackers coming up with new ways to beat such security systems. With the introduction of exploit tools that could generate malware that could change its attack patterns to avoid detection, it was clear that the cybersecurity industry had been beaten by the hackers. In addition, hackers were exploiting the weaknesses in networks to gain access to remote computers and carry out malicious actions.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Network security tools</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Owing to the increased breaches facilitated through the network, the cybersecurity industry finally responded with more specialized tools that could prevent attacks that were coming from the network. They, therefore, came up with intrusion detection and prevention systems and major improvements to the rudimentary firewalls that were in use. However, these were still signature-based systems. Initially, they were effective in stopping the network breaches, since hackers did not know many workarounds. They were able to block malicious traffic and keep away hackers from carrying out malicious activities on networks. However, hackers would soon discover ways to beat the network security tools. Therefore, network intrusions came back and the tools designed to prevent them were unable to keep up with newer attack techniques. This caused the cybersecurity industry to respond in the 2000s with more additions to cybersecurity.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Transformations in cybersecurity</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Hackers in the early 2000s began experimenting with many security evasion tactics to beat the existing security tools. They had already come up with techniques to evade security tools on networks. They had also come up with a new attack method called a <strong>buffer overflow</strong>. A buffer overflow is conducted mostly on client/server apps, where payloads are delivered with data specifically aimed to fill and write outside memory buffers. For instance, hackers would supply scripts to log in input fields in a client app, which would cause the server to import files. Since the server would be expecting just a few characters in the input field, the excess data would cause a buffer overflow, causing it to fail or function erroneously. Exploit toolkits were also being modified to include security evasion tactics.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Layered security</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Since having antivirus or firewall programs didn't provide enough security, the cybersecurity industry took a new turn where organizations were advised to have layered security. Therefore, they had to extend their budgets to purchase cybersecurity tools for different types of threats on different attack landscapes. The move was aimed at creating a hardened security shield against organizations. This strategy came to be referred to as <strong>defense in depth</strong>. At the minimum, organizations had to have a firewall, an antivirus program, intrusion-detection systems, strong authentication on login platforms, and encryption of data. The strategy worked well against single-vectored attacks. Hackers who had bought exploit kits would fail to go through all layers of protection so as to breach an organization's security. Hackers who had been relying on using network vulnerabilities were finding an extra layer of security that they could not go through.</p>
<p>The problem with layered security was the cost; it was too expensive. Cybersecurity became a significant expense for many organizations. Company executives were having a hard time authorizing IT departments to spend so much on the tools. Nonetheless, the layered security strategy also pushed hackers to go back and come up with better ways of breaching organizations' security measures. The following diagram shows the different layers of security and their components:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/7a6cdc5f-2ef5-4c19-aee7-406ab56c31f8.png" style="width:48.67em;height:31.58em;"/></p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">New security threats</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>By 2010, a new pattern of cyber criminal activity had been detected. Attackers could breach a network and stay hidden in the network for a long period without detection. Such types of attacks were referred to as <strong>advanced persistent threats</strong>. Hacking became a profession and cyber criminals were taking the time to study targeted systems and acquire the tools needed to attack them. Once an attack was successful, the attackers would maintain access to it as they stole or modified data. One of these incidences was the Stuxnet attack against a nuclear fuel enrichment facility in Iran. The attackers, believed to have been state-sponsored, breached the security systems of the facility and stayed hidden in their networks for a long time. The malware collected enough information to determine how to carry out the attack that caused the destruction of the facility. This attack was most significant due to the zero-day vulnerabilities it used and the fact that the attacked computers were not even connected to the internet.</p>
<p>In addition to advanced persistent attacks, <strong>phishing</strong> also made a comeback. Phishing was initially popular when members of the public were just getting computers and access to the internet for the first time. However, the phishing attacks of that time were quite rudimentary. The most common one was called the <strong>Nigerian Prince scam</strong>. It was an email sent to many people highlighting the tribulations of a purported Nigerian prince trying to get his inheritance money, but who needed some assistance to do so. Mostly, the targets were being asked to send some money to help clear the money. The scam gained popularity, before becoming less effective after it was publicized. However, 2011 saw a new wave of phishing attacks that were more sophisticated. The attempts shifted from simply trying to trick internet users into sending small amounts of money. Hackers started cloning legitimate company websites and email templates and informing them that there was a problem with the user accounts created with these companies. Users were being offered to rectify the issue by logging into given links. On the cloned websites, users would give out their real credentials and the hackers would use these credentials to steal data or money or gain access to sensitive systems.</p>
<p>After this, <strong>Denial of Service</strong> (<strong>DoS</strong>) attacks also came into the spotlight. The increased number of personal computers on the internet that did not have sufficient security systems was a blessing to hackers. They would install malware in such computers that would recruit them into a network of zombie computers, called a <strong>botnet</strong>. These zombie computers would be commanded by the hackers to send illegitimate traffic at specified targets, thus causing DoS and DDoS attacks.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Responses to the new threats</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>It became apparent in the industry that stopping the known attacks was not enough. Hackers were increasingly becoming successful in beating the security tools that relied on signatures to stop attacks. They were also targeting users instead of having to try to breach the multiple layers of security, and they had come up with attack techniques such as DoS that were hard to stop. There were two responses to the new developments: <strong>cyber resilience</strong> and <strong>user training</strong>. Cyber resilience was adopted to keep business operations going during and after cyber attacks. The end goal of having security changed from simply protecting the organization from attacks, to ensuring that business functions would not be severely interrupted by attacks. Businesses paid more attention to having ready backups, alternative hot sites to take over operations during cyber attacks, and faster incident-response measures to ensure that organizations could mitigate and recover from attacks more quickly.</p>
<p>Secondly, organizations started paying more attention to training their users against cybersecurity threats. This was because employees had become easier targets for cyber criminals. Social engineering was becoming a more successful way of breaching into many organizations. This has remained true for many years. Statistics provided in 2016 by the Anti-Phishing Working Group showed that, of all malware infections recorded, 95% were enabled by humans. The report showed that less than 5% of attacks are targeted at technical flaws in software. Most attacks are targeted at employees.</p>
<p>Therefore, organizations added employees to the cybersecurity chain and became more focused on teaching them about phishing and other common types of cybersecurity threats. The knowledge gained was intended to enable them to avoid falling into traps such as providing login credentials or clicking on malicious links.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Advancements in security technology to security 2.0</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The cybersecurity industry was under immense pressure to move from signature-based detection techniques to other, more efficient alternatives. The old ways of hardening the security infrastructures in organizations increasingly failed. Despite having many layers of security, organizations were still being breached. Zero-day vulnerabilities and social engineering were major contributors to these attacks. The cost of cyber attacks also increased. In 2018, IBM published that the global average cost of a cyber attack was $3,860,000 USD. This cost factored in expenses such as lawsuits and loss of customers.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Anomaly-based security systems</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Finally, cybersecurity tools got a major update, allowing them to do active scans of traffic and program execution, and determine any deviations from the normal patterns. Cybersecurity moved from signature-based detection to anomaly-based detection. For instance, firewalls were made to detect when servers were accepting multiple outside connections from new clients and at a higher rate than normal. This would be a sign that the connections were illegitimate and coming from a botnet. Therefore, such connections would be dropped. Many cybersecurity vendors came up with tools that could allow organizations to do real-time threat analysis, thus preventing attacks from unknown attack vectors.</p>
<p>Anomaly-based security tools also solved a significant problem that the cybersecurity industry was facing. This was the reporting of false positives. Initially, cybersecurity tools were just made to be more thorough in checking malicious programs and activities. It reached a point that they were so thorough, they were reporting harmless programs and activities as security threats. This was most common in network security tools, which were becoming highly inefficient in determining and separating actual threats from activities that had a small resemblance to threats. False positives were making the security tools unreliable. Network and security admins had to ignore many would-be threats, and sometimes, they would ignore legitimate threats in the process. The introduction of anomaly-based security tools ensured that the detected threats were real threats and needed to be stopped.</p>
<p>Anomaly-based security systems also led to growing ease of detection. Initially, cybersecurity tools had to check with many signatures, and this slowed down the performance of networks and systems. Anomaly-based tools did not have to refer to a signatures database. Instead, they did real-time analysis to check whether traffic or apps had abnormal behavior. Lastly, anomaly-based threats countered many social engineering attacks. On the network, these tools were capturing the packet headers to read origin and destination IP addresses and thus allow in traffic from known sources. Traffic from unknown sources was being subjected to thorough checks to find more details, such as whether the origin had been blacklisted or reported by other security tools to be malicious.</p>
<p>The main limitation of anomaly-based detection was that humans had to be involved in making key decisions. Therefore, tools with these capabilities were more hands-on than autonomous. Enterprises did not have enough workers to tend to all the alerts that these systems were sending that needed human intervention. Therefore, the cybersecurity industry decided to further improve these solutions to make them more accurate and autonomous. A lot of research was done on ML and AI. Today, cybersecurity companies are increasingly considering adding ML and AI into their cybersecurity products. The future is expected to be dominated by such products.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">How ML and AI will play a larger role in cybersecurity</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>AI and ML present a new dawn in the cybersecurity industry. AI is not a new concept to computing. It was defined in 1956 as the ability of computers to perform tasks that were characteristic of human intelligence. Such tasks included learning, making decisions, solving problems, and understanding and recognizing speech. ML is a broad term referring to the ability of computers to acquire new knowledge without human intervention. ML is a subset of AI and can take many forms, such as deep learning, reinforcement learning, and Bayesian networks. AI is poised to disrupt the cybersecurity space in many ways in what might be the ultimate win for the cybersecurity industry against cyber criminals.</p>
<p>AI/ML in cybersecurity involves deploying self-sufficient tools that can detect, stop, or prevent threats without any human intervention. The detection of threats is done based on the training that the algorithm in the security tool will have undertaken on its own, and the data already supplied by the developers. Therefore, throughout its life cycle, an AI-powered security tool will become better at detecting threats. The original dataset of threats provided by developers will provide reference base that it can use to know what is normal and what is malicious. The security tool will then be exposed to insecure environments before final deployment. In the environments filled with threats, the system will continually learn based on the threats that it detects or stops. Hacking attempts will also be directed at it. These attempts will involve hacking or attempts to overwhelm its processing capabilities with lots of malicious traffic. The tool will learn the most commonly used hacking techniques for breaching systems or networks. For instance, it will detect the use of password-cracking tools such as <strong>Aircrack-ng</strong> on wireless networks. Similarly, it will detect brute-force attacks on login interfaces. The main role that will be played by humans in cybersecurity will be to update the algorithms of the AI tools with more capabilities.</p>
<p>AI security systems will possibly contain all threats. Conventional security systems are usually unable to detect threats that exploit zero-day vulnerabilities. With AI, even after evolving and adapting new attack patterns, malware will not be able to penetrate the AI system. The system will check the code being run by the malware and predict the outcome. Outcomes that are deemed to be harmful will cause the AI system to prevent the program from executing. Even if the malware obfuscates its code, the AI system will keep tabs on the execution pattern. It will be able to stop the program from executing once it attempts to carry out malicious functions such as making modifications to sensitive data or the operating system.</p>
<p>It is already projected that AI will overtake human intelligence. Therefore, a foreseeable point in the future will see all cybersecurity roles moved from humans to AI systems. This is both advantageous and disadvantageous. Today, when an AI system fails, the results are normally tolerable. This is because the scope of operations played by AI systems is still limited. However, when AI finally overtakes human intelligence, the results of a failure in the systems might be intolerable. Since the security systems will be better than humans, it is possible that they will be in a position to refuse input from humans. A malfunctioning system might, therefore, continue operating without any interventions. The perfectionist nature of AI will be both good and bad. Current security systems work toward reducing the number of attacks that can succeed against a system. However, AI systems work toward eliminating all threats. Therefore, false-positive detection might not be considered as such; they might be treated as positive detection and thus cause disruptions in the affected harmless systems that are stopped from executing.</p>
<p>Lastly, there are fears that the integration of ML and AI into cybersecurity might lead to more harm than good. As has been observed over the years, attackers are resilient. They will always try to find ways to beat a cybersecurity system. Normal cybersecurity tools are beaten using more sophisticated methods than the tools are aware of. However, the only way to beat AI will be to confuse it. Therefore, threat actors might infiltrate AI training systems and provide bad datasets, thus affecting the knowledge acquired by the AI-backed security systems. The actors might also create their own adversarial AI system to even the playing field. This would result in an AI versus AI battle.</p>
<p>Lastly, hackers might still use methods that circumvent AI security systems. Social engineering can still be carried out physically. In such cases, AI systems will not be able to help the target. <strong>Shoulder surfing</strong>â€”the simple act of looking over someone's shoulder as they enter crucial detailsâ€”is also conducted without the use of hacking tools. This also circumvents the security system. Therefore, AI and ML might not be the ultimate answer to cyber crime.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Summary</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>This chapter has looked at the evolution of cybersecurity from legacy to advanced and then on to futuristic technologies such as AI and ML. It has been explained that the first cybersecurity system was an antivirus system that was created to stop the first worm. Cybersecurity then followed this example, where security tools were created as responses to threats. Legacy security systems started the approach of using signature-based detection. This is where security tools would be loaded with signatures of common malware and use this knowledge base to detect and stop any program that matched the signature. However, the security systems were focused on malware, and thus, hackers focused on breaching organizations through the network. In 1970, an OS company was breached via its network and a copy of an OS was stolen. In 1990, the US military suffered a similar attack where a hacker broke into 97 computers and corrupted them. Therefore, the cybersecurity industry came up with stronger network security tools. However, these tools still used the signature-based approach and thus could not be trusted to keep all attacks at bay.</p>
<p>In the 2000s, the cybersecurity industry came up with a new concept of security where it advised organizations to have layered security. Therefore, they had to have security systems for securing networks, computers, and data. However, layered security was quite expensive, yet some threat vectors were still infiltrating computers and networks. By 2010, cyber criminals started using threats called <strong>advanced persistent threats</strong>. Attackers were no longer doing hit-and-run attacks; they were infiltrating networks and staying hidden in the networks while carrying out malicious activities. In addition to this, phishing was revolutionized and made more effective. Lastly, there was another development where attackers were using DoS attacks to overwhelm the capabilities of servers and firewalls. Since many companies were being forced out of business by these attacks, the cybersecurity industry developed a new approach to security, known as <strong>cyber resilience</strong>. Instead of focusing on how to secure the organization during attacks, they ensured that organizations could survive the attacks. In addition to this, users became more involved in cybersecurity where organizations started focusing on training them to avoid common threats. This marked the end of security 1.0.</p>
<p>The cybersecurity industry then moved to the current <em>"security 2.0"</em>, where it finally created an alternative to signature-based security systems. Anomaly-based security systems were introduced and they came with more efficiencies and capabilities than signature-based systems. Anomaly-based systems detect attacks by checking normal patterns or behaviors against anomalies. Apps and traffic that conform to the normal patterns and behaviors are allowed to execute or pass, while those that do not are stopped. While anomaly-based tools are effective, they rely on decisions from humans. Therefore, a lot of work still comes back to IT security admins. The answer to this has been to leverage AI with the hopes that such security systems will become self-sufficient.</p>
<p>AI sounds promising, though many doubts have been cast against it. AI and ML security tools will operate by detecting threats based on anomalies and taking informed decisions on how to handle these threats. The AI-security tools will have a learning module that will ensure that they only get better with time. Before deployment, these systems will be extensively trained using datasets and real environments that have real threats. Once the learning module is able to provide sufficient information to protect an organization from common threats, it will be deployed. One of the main advantages of AI security systems is that they will evolve along with the threats. Any new threats will be studied and thwarted. Despite the advantages of AI-powered security systems, there are worries that they may ultimately become harmful. As AI overtakes human intelligence, there might come a point where such tools will not accept any human input. There are also worries that attackers might poison the algorithms to make them harmful. Therefore, the future of AI in cyber security is not easy to foretell, but there should be two main outcomes: either AI-backed security systems will finally contain cyber crime, or AI systems will go rogue, or be made to go rogue, and become cyber threats.</p>
