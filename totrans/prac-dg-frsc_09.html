"Every case is unique!" is a common cry. Well, yes indeed, but there are so many characteristics common to most cases, and that common knowledge can be used better than it is and on a wider scale.</p><p>This chapter reflects on the fundamental idea of digital evidence analysis, which is to ensure that irrespective of the circumstances of a case and any prohibitions imposed on a practitioner, as thorough as possible an examination of the evidence is undertaken to test its authenticity, relevance, and reliability.</p><p>This chapter describes some common pitfalls that diminish the admissibility of digital evidence as well as affecting the evidentiary weight or value of evidence that has been tendered. Validating evidence relies on testing and checking it to ensure it is what it purports to be. This requires a structured analysis of the evidence collected, including the development and testing of hypotheses and counterarguments in line with forensic standards. Practitioners need to justify their selection of the evidence based on some rational reasoning process that is explainable and free from bias or unsupported comment.</p><p>Presenting complex technical evidence to laypersons during hearings in terms they understand is the culmination of many forensic examinations and the endeavor and expertise of the practitioner. Testifying in court requires composure and clarity of careful preparation, and certainty of the evidence is crucial. This book is not intended to be a definitive guide for providing expert witnesses with a mass of advice; that is far too complicated an issue; you are referred to the following repository to find out more:</p><p>

It will emphasize the importance of impartiality in selecting evidence to ensure that the courts' expectations are met.</p><p>The chapter outlines the difficulty in validating digital evidence and offers some solutions to address the problem.

The validity of digital evidence must be tested to determine its admissibility in legal cases in the same way as other established forms of evidence are verified.</p><p>As outlined in <a class="link" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. The Nature and Special Properties of Digital Evidence">Chapter 3</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>The Nature and Special Properties of Digital Evidence</em></span>, for evidence to be admissible in a hearing, it must meet three conditions: that it was obtained lawfully, is relevant to the case, and has not been contaminated.</p><p>It must <a id="id666" class="indexterm"/>generally be demonstrated that it has not been altered or damaged in any way prior to, during, or after its acquisition and that adequate or sufficient evidence was collected to support a case. If it passes these conditions, it may be argued that the evidence has been validated or at least tested and the likelihood of its validity has been determined. If it is valid, then it may be tendered and judged on its evidentiary merit.</p><p>There really is no universally well-established or standard process to guide digital forensic practitioners in the validation of digital evidence artifacts to ensure their admissibility in legal proceedings. However, there is a pressing need for a more scientific measurement of digital evidence validity, as distinct from practitioners' or lawyers' intuition, which may be insightful in simple "yes" and "no" instances of evidence analysis.</p><p>It is evident from more intricate or convoluted instances that digital evidence can be misleading because of its special properties. Most importantly, file locations, timestamps, and other metadata containing file antecedents and file data require close scrutiny to ensure that its properties may be fully identified and explained. This becomes more challenging to analyze when correlating file events introduces a degree of uncertainty that must be measured in some way to determine the validity of the exhibit.</p><p>To illustrate <a id="id667" class="indexterm"/>the problem with what appears at first inspection to be a simple matter, consider the location of an incriminating e-mail found in the <span class="strong"><strong>Sent Mail</strong></span> box of a computer. The computer owner becomes the primary suspect in a suspect-led examination (all too common), since there is a typically implied presumption of guilt because the computer owner is the one most likely responsible for its creation and dispatch. In an evidence-led examination, the evidence is examined objectively without bias and faulty intuition, and an attempt is made to determine its antecedents and links to possible transgressors. Knowing the full processes involved in this alternative type of examination, the courts would prefer such an objective process to mere intuition.</p><p>In this example, the simple statement that the e-mail file was in the outbox suggests that it was sent by some user of the computer—well, it was or it wasn't. But in reality, checking its antecedents raises a range of questions, including determining whether there was a "hack", whether it was sent from another computer and synchronized to the suspect's computer, whether the timestamps were anomalous, or whether the message has been manipulated. If the response to each of these questions is a yes or no or even uncertain, it is possible, with careful attention to detail, to make some sense of what happened, but that still requires a measure of likelihood because of the result. If the answers to some or all questions are uncertain, that increases doubt as to the reasonableness of the evidence; consequently, some testing, checking, and, if possible, corroboration of the evidence, is necessary to determine the truth.</p><p>Explaining such complexity in terms understandable to the layperson requires clear understanding of the technicalities as well as sound communication skills. This is described in more detail later in the chapter. The literature shows that the difficulties hampering practitioners in effectively validating evidentiary admissibility may be attributed to:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Challenges explaining the technical complexity of digital evidence to courts</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The immaturity of the forensic subdiscipline</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The ineffective security integrity of computers and networks</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Evidence contamination</li></ul></div><div class="section" title="Challenges explaining the complexity of digital evidence"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl2sec144"/>Challenges explaining the complexity of digital evidence</h2></div></div></div><p>It is widely <a id="id668" class="indexterm"/>accepted, and certainly borne out by my own research and liaisons with various legal teams, that the legal fraternity and clients really do not always have a clear understanding of computer systems and are often in the dark as to the validity and significance of the digital evidence presented to them. Although it has much in common with other forms of indirect evidence, such as paper documents, the inherent technical complexity of its properties challenges forensic practitioners attempting to present and explain digital evidence in many legal settings. The increasing reliance on digital evidence is likely to increase legal challenges to its admissibility and, ultimately, its evidentiary weight.</p><p>The use of diagrams, Toulmin charts (described in the <span class="emphasis"><em>Presentation of digital evidence</em></span> section of this chapter), and other visual aids goes further than a detailed report, which many find confusing; visuals can break through communication barriers.</p></div><div class="section" title="The immaturity of the forensic subdiscipline"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl2sec145"/>The immaturity of the forensic subdiscipline</h2></div></div></div><p>Observers <a id="id669" class="indexterm"/>have suggested an imprudent wish by many practitioners to adopt scientific processes and tools too rapidly in digital forensic examinations, together with an undesirable perception that the proper review and validation of methods and processes is not necessary. Such review and testing is often fully and even partially bypassed. Concern about this poor practice is shared by me. It seems that this misperception creates situations where evidence produced by new processes is challenged because the process or new forensic tool used in its recovery and analysis has not been validated to determine its fitness for use in forensic examinations. That does not mean the evidence recovered is invalid but that the processes and tools make it less reliable if they have not been tested and independently and scientifically evaluated.</p><p>This is a worldwide problem, with cases relying on information and testimony based on faulty forensic science analyses, which is believed to have contributed to wrongful convictions of innocent persons. The absence of standard protocols governing forensic practice in a given discipline and uncertainty about the validity of many forensic processes and practices is surprisingly not uncommon.</p><p>Evidence that is denied admission in court proceedings because of unsound evidence-collection, processing, and preservation processes is evidence of wasted effort. For some time, there has been a perception among informed observers and practitioners that while the discipline has grown, it has not matured. The lack of substantial and significant research into the discipline has failed to identify broad scientific standards. Moreover, there is no clearly established science to underpin and support the use of digital evidence. Fingerprint analysis used for suspect identification has long been an established discipline; however, it has recently come under scrutiny for lacking any robust scientific groundwork.</p><p>The <a id="id670" class="indexterm"/>immaturity of digital forensics has brought into question its justification as a scientific discipline because of a lack of standardization and consistency within legal jurisdictions and criminal and civil investigation environments.</p></div><div class="section" title="The ineffective security integrity of computers and networks"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl2sec146"/>The ineffective security integrity of computers and networks</h2></div></div></div><p>Courts <a id="id671" class="indexterm"/>have trouble evaluating evidence because it is sometimes difficult for practitioners to provide them with assurances about the integrity and reliability of the computing and network systems where the evidence is stored. It is common when tendering digital evidence that the custodian of the records, or other qualified witness, proves that the records were trustworthy.</p><p>Evidence corroboration of the soundness of the computer device and those managing computer networks is assumed by the courts, which also expect assurances attesting the security and integrity of computer and network systems that are known to be vulnerable to a range of threats.</p></div><div class="section" title="Evidence contamination"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl2sec147"/>Evidence contamination</h2></div></div></div><p>Not<a id="id672" class="indexterm"/> only must the evidence be lawfully acquired, the courts now recognize the increased risk of evidence tampering and authentication problems with digital evidence. The relative ease with which DNA evidence can be falsified and created, thus creating great uncertainty about its soundness, has been well demonstrated in recent years. It has recently been clearly demonstrated that digital evidence may be modified without leaving any obvious trace of the commission of a transgression, and although the previous existence of evidence may be speculated, if it did exist, it is irretrievable.</p><p>The use of valid forensic tools minimizes the risk of evidence contamination during the recovery of data from digital devices, which assists the courts in determining the reliability of the recovered data. However, when applying standard tests, such as those in the United States, to cases involving digital forensic tools and processes, the status of digital forensics as a scientific discipline causes some disputes over the lack of broadly accepted standards and processes. The preservation of digital evidence has been described in some detail in earlier chapters, and its importance cannot be overemphasized.</p></div></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Impartiality in selecting evidence"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl1sec67"/>Impartiality in selecting evidence</h1></div></div></div><p>The<a id="id673" class="indexterm"/> recovery and forensic analysis of digital evidence and its ultimate presentation in court is no different than that of other forensic exhibits. It requires the best forensic standards and expects practitioners to possess special skills, notably:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The ability to undertake impartial, unbiased, and through examinations of the evidence</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Possessing and adhering to a strong ethical code</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">A modicum of sound forensic examination experience</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Having access to other practitioners to cross-pollinate</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Being widely read on digital forensic practices and case studies</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Having access to the best forensic tools and possessing a high level of competence in their use and deployment</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Possessing sufficient understanding of relevant legislation</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Recognizing the limitations of their competence and signaling the need for specialist support</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The ability to understand client needs and define the nature of the examination at an early stage and, if necessary, on an ongoing basis</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Being a sound communicator, with the ability to explain findings to the legal team and, ultimately, the courts</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Being able to satisfy the court that evidence has been checked and tested to determine its validity</li></ul></div><p>All of these attributes are expected of forensic practitioners and, most importantly, they must show that there was no bias in their case examinations. Those practitioners who are basically dirty witnesses throw away their impartiality and get a reputation for serving their clients or organizations, and are certainly in no way servants of the court. Others tend to select evidence that fits a subjective view, often termed <a id="id674" class="indexterm"/>
<span class="strong"><strong>examiner bias</strong></span>.</p><p>Indolence and banality can dominate practitioners' behaviors, especially if they feel their opinion will not be challenged, as well as them developing a sense of superiority. It happens and is a pitfall the conscientious must avoid. These ethical issues are discussed later in more detail in the <span class="emphasis"><em>Ethical issues confronting digital forensics practitioners</em></span> section.</p><p>From my forensic experience working on criminal and civil cases, it is abundantly clear that looking for evidence sitting in even smaller-sized datasets requires patience, concentration, and a dedication to doing a good job for the client. The discipline may sound glamorous, and the odd cameo court appearance where the evidence is presented and argued can be a rewarding experience, but sometimes it is harrowing and intimidating. That being said, the presentation of the evidence, irrespective of its value, must be based on a sound professional examination and analysis.</p><p>In an ideal <a id="id675" class="indexterm"/>world, where time and resources are not restricted, the practitioner can devote time and thought to completing a thorough, unhurried analysis. However, if the client is on a low budget, there may be limited time available to complete a thorough examination. Impending trial dates and other tight schedules often limit the amount of time available to the practitioner. Added to this crippling lack of time to ensure thoroughness of examinations, other factors, such as unreasonably heavy workloads or the unpleasantness of the case topic, such as sexual indecency and violence, sometimes results in practitioners being stressed and disillusioned—not really a situation conducive to maintaining effective forensic output.</p><div class="section" title="Meaning is only clear in context"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl2sec148"/>Meaning is only clear in context</h2></div></div></div><p>Patterns<a id="id676" class="indexterm"/> of information combine to provide substance, and just like a puzzle, pieces are put together to get a picture. However, such evidential artifacts may be easily misinterpreted, and are sometimes misleading or patently false.</p><p>Missed evidence or information not recognized as relevant to the investigation can have catastrophic consequences, and there are common problems caused by a failure to:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Identify evidence as present</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Collect evidence while it is fresh</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Identify relevant materials for a warrant</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Properly label and record exhibits</li></ul></div><p>Conversely, the practitioner might:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Identify things as evidence that are not actually evidence</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Collect things that are not allowed by the warrant</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Mislabel exhibits</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Create forgeries</li></ul></div></div><div class="section" title="Faulty case management and evidence validation"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl2sec149"/>Faulty case management and evidence validation</h2></div></div></div><p>Since 2008, I <a id="id677" class="indexterm"/>have provided expert analysis of digital evidence to defense criminal lawyers in Australia. This involved the<a id="id678" class="indexterm"/> reexamination and validation of digital evidence presented in state and federal law enforcement cases. A number of defendants were able to sway the jury and were consequently acquitted. While the deliberations of the jury are strictly confidential, it was thought that the reexamination and testing of the digital evidence, which provided additional explanation and a contrary view of the evidence, and providing all the evidence <a id="id679" class="indexterm"/>with greater clarity may have helped the jurors reach fairer or better-informed decisions.</p><p>What is evident to me, and my fellow workers in the field, are two related problems:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Faulty case management through inadequate analysis and presentation of digital evidence</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Incomplete and incorrect validation of digital evidence</li></ul></div><p>In practice, inadequate <a id="id680" class="indexterm"/>analysis is often due to a range of factors, such as caseload or practitioner inexperience. However, sometimes it is due to evidence relevant to the case being ignored or not identified. This evidence may be of an exculpatory form, in that it may exonerate the suspect or implicate another suspect. The preponderance of some practitioners to cherry-pick the lowest-hanging fruit when selecting evidence and a lack of analysis of the evidence to ensure it is what it purports to be continues to be a problem. It shows a need for more accountability by practitioners, who are in fact servants of the court.</p><p>The real danger when examining evidence, irrespective of its form, is that it can be seductive and can offer what the finder wishes to perceive. What might at first glance appear obvious may be deceptive. The practitioner must stick to the evidence and not become preoccupied with whether it will prove guilt or innocence based on personal feelings. Unsuccessful prosecutions based on what has been exposed as biased and faulty interpretation of digital evidence are not that uncommon. This is unhelpful, as it can aggravate cases where the evidence, if successfully challenged, does not result in the conviction of a guilty person. Conversely, biased evidence can result in the conviction of innocents.</p><p>Practitioners must expect their presentations and expert opinions to be challenged and repudiated, because the pillar of law in many jurisdictions is that the defendant is innocent until proved guilty of the offence or transgression. There are some exceptions, such as in drug trafficking and possession cases, where there is a reversal of this fundamental protection. In those cases, the onus is on the accused to explain away the evidence and prove their innocence.</p><p>"The defendant is presumed innocent" seems to be a hackneyed expression and a misunderstood term. That the police would not have charged the defendant if there were not a modicum of proof of guilt is another dangerous fallacy. A prima facie case does not presume guilt nor is it the inevitable outcome. It is for the prosecution to establish as compelling a case as possible for the judge or jury to deliberate upon. The defendant does not have to prove innocence; the prosecutor has to establish whether there is a nexus between the events in question and the defendant. In effect, they have to prove that the accused is not innocent.</p><p>In terms of <a id="id681" class="indexterm"/>cases relying on digital evidence, it is often the case that the evidence, which may well be true, can be easily<a id="id682" class="indexterm"/> repudiated. Some validation process is required to determine, among other factors, whether the evidence is accurate, factual, relevant (and consistently relevant), applies to the time of the transgression, and is the complete truth. Other synonyms could be added here, but the gist is that some formal process is needed to assist practitioners to define the validity of the evidence that they present. This is discussed in the following section.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="The structured and balanced analysis of digital evidence"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl1sec68"/>The structured and balanced analysis of digital evidence</h1></div></div></div><p>Clearly, it is<a id="id683" class="indexterm"/> hoped that you, having read through previous chapters, would realize that intuition is not enough and does not impress the court—solid facts are needed and should be supported with logical analysis. Attempts must be made to locate all evidence and intuition alone may not be sufficient for an inexperienced practitioner to locate hidden and hard-to-find evidence. The incomplete identification of all evidence that should be located can thwart an examination of crucial facts. This may be due to the incompetence or inexperience of a practitioner or because of the lack of time and available resources.</p><p>Not validating the evidence can destroy a case if it is later challenged successfully. I am especially critical of practitioners who miss <span class="emphasis"><em>exculpatory</em></span> evidence in their pursuit of placing their prime suspect in the "frame". Linking the suspect to incriminating events, assuming the events are really incriminating, is the first hurdle in any examination, and this requires hypothesis testing. Even if the events are incriminating, the relationship between them and the suspect must be also tested.</p><div class="section" title="Developing hypotheses"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl2sec150"/>Developing hypotheses</h2></div></div></div><p>An internal investigation <a id="id684" class="indexterm"/>by a company's systems administrator, for example, will result in a less formal report to management and often leads to evidence contamination. This common phenomenon, which plagues forensic examinations, is highlighted in the case study at the end of the chapter. The task of developing a hypothesis or a line of argument about what may have occurred on the device or network is usually presented to persons other than the practitioners, investigators, and legal team.</p><p>The results of forensic examination may be presented in a criminal or civil court, before some legal hearing, or, in the case of an internal disciplinary matter, before a management team. The team leading the action will put forward an ultimate hypothesis supported by hypotheses of various evidence artifacts and arguments. Prior to the hearing, the practitioner may well need to test each hypothesis of the digital evidence that may reject the hypothesis or require corroboration to support it. A true professional will look for an alternative hypothesis or counter-hypothesis to test which is more likely.</p><p>More exacting <a id="id685" class="indexterm"/>means of measuring and standardizing the evidence may help practitioners, investigators, and jurors decide on the validity of the evidence. For the practitioner, it is essential to always remain objective. Once digital evidence is admitted as evidence, common sense seems to fly out the window.</p><p>Developing standard operating procedures for certain types of cases will limit the potential for human error and is often most useful as a general process. There is, of course, a need to develop a set of required actions for various types of cases. It is important that the evidence stand out on its own and point to the truth. Practitioners should avoid selecting which action to undertake as the examination progresses, as it may be considered contentious, not <span class="emphasis"><em>evidence-led</em></span>, far too subjective, and guilt-seeking. It can also miss leads and misinterpret other facts rather than being built on a solid framework.</p></div><div class="section" title="Modeling arguments"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl2sec151"/>Modeling arguments</h2></div></div></div><p>An <a id="id686" class="indexterm"/>important question for the practitioner to try to answer is what properties are necessary and/or sufficient for evidence to be viable in a specific investigative content.

<a id="id697" class="indexterm"/> by forensic practitioners as part of an evidence validation process, as distinct from the courts, has some merit.</p><p>Researchers have stressed the appropriateness and importance of distinguishing scientific knowledge from judicial judgment, as the former can be made using Bayesian probability theory. Litigators and judges have tended to avoid statistics based on probability reasoning to interpret the plausibility of evidence, yet is there is not a need for legal practitioners to understand the fundamentals of probabilistic reasoning? Using such processes to enhance the decision makers' understanding of what the evidence most likely suggests may be beneficial in the digital environment.</p><p>My research has shown that such a model offers practitioners a useful validation process that would:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Navigate in a structured way through groups of evidence to identify exhibits requiring validation</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Test and check those exhibits to measure their validity as evidence</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Provide an understandable explanation on how measurements are calculated</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Provide meaningful measurements of validity</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Serve as a training tool for novice practitioners</li></ul></div><p>The likelihood of the soundness of evidence helps the forensic expert provide an assessment of the objective probative value of their evidence. From this, the jury or adjudicator <a id="id698" class="indexterm"/>can decide on the probability of guilt or innocence of the accused. Bayes' theorem is based on probability or the likelihood of something happening or being true. It can be expressed in terms of odds, such as predicting the likelihood of India beating Pakistan in a Test match. These odds are not a random guess or inspired guesswork based on threads of evidence, such as abductive reasoning, but based on known and likely outcomes that can often result in a far more reliable prediction than human guesswork.</p><p>The evidentiary weight of an exhibit expressed as a likelihood ratio in a legal case seeking to prove guilt can be expressed as:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04931_09_10.jpg" alt="Rationale for selection"/></div><p>When that likelihood ratio is combined with the strength of the other evidence known to the decision maker (the prior odds), then the decision maker is armed with <a id="id699" class="indexterm"/>
<span class="strong"><strong>posterior odds</strong></span>. Bayesian logic can be used to measure likelihood ratios of admissibility in a similar way, as follows:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04931_09_11.jpg" alt="Rationale for selection"/></div><p>In Bayesian reasoning, every hypothesis under consideration must have some probability of being true. If that hypothesis based on the attached evidence is true, then there is a particular probability that the item of evidence will be observed; by contrast, if that hypothesis is false, then there is another, different, probability that this item of evidence will be observed.</p></div><div class="section" title="The conceptual framework of the model"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl2sec155"/>The conceptual framework of the model</h2></div></div></div><p>My <a id="id700" class="indexterm"/>research posits that the validity of each evidence object must be checked before it can be considered admissible. In other words, validation of the evidence in support of a claim about a certain state of affairs is essential. These conditions of the admissibility of digital evidence (and circumstantial evidence in general) may be defined as its legal admissibility, plus its state of being untainted, its relevance to the issues at hand, and, ideally, whether it is corroborated. The conceptual framework describing these four conditions of evidence and the relationship between evidence and claim are set out in the following diagram:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04931_09_02.jpg" alt="The conceptual framework of the model"/><div class="caption"><p>The conceptual framework of the model</p></div></div><p>Therefore, for <a id="id701" class="indexterm"/>the purpose of the model, <span class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> conditions of admissibility must be fulfilled, namely, if the evidence is legally admissible, untainted, and relevant, then the evidence may be admitted and, if appropriate, the evidence should be independently corroborated.

Evidence input is a formal way of selecting evidence and preparing it for interrogation built on preset tests and checks.

The statistical database consists of a broad collection of information questions relating to the relevance of the evidence objects being examined. The questions require empirical proof to show that they and the range of associated answers were appropriate for inclusion in the statistical database. A wide range of digital evidence artifacts may be validated on the basis of whether they meet specific conditions of admissibility requiring a simple <code class="literal">Yes</code>, <code class="literal">No</code>, <code class="literal">Unsure</code>, <code class="literal">Discounted</code> or <code class="literal">Cannot Be Determined</code> output statement or response.</p><p>The output includes an explanation of the reasoning process in terms understandable by practitioners as well as comments on suggested further investigation processes required if the provided measurement results in a negative prognosis.</p></div><div class="section" title="Applying Bayesian reasoning to the analysis of validation"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl2sec157"/>Applying Bayesian reasoning to the analysis of validation</h2></div></div></div><p>The real value<a id="id704" class="indexterm"/> of the model presented is to assist the validating of evidence where there exists a degree of uncertainty. The first condition of the model—the legal admissibility of the evidence—is a <a id="id705" class="indexterm"/>reasonably straightforward component, unlike the other conditions that often appear complex with no hard-and-fast outcome statement. This relatively uncomplicated <a id="id706" class="indexterm"/>condition is described in the following subsection.</p><div class="section" title="The comparative simplicity of the analysis of legal admissibility"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl3sec01"/>The comparative simplicity of the analysis of legal admissibility</h3></div></div></div><p>In many<a id="id707" class="indexterm"/> instances, the validity of evidence is clearly substantiated and unchallenged. The lawful admissibility of evidence requires that some legal process be followed to permit the seizure and examination of exhibits or that the lawful owner grant permission for its acquisition. Except in exceptional conditions, it must normally be confirmed that evidence was acquired lawfully for it to be tendered during a trial. The legitimacy of the circumstances of the seizure of an exhibit, such as a mobile phone under a search warrant, may seem straightforward, provided there are no special conditions that require closer compliance with the order.</p><p>In e-discovery, the search order may specify that only certain data may be collected in order to protect the privacy of the custodians and user(s) of the data. Any evidence collected outside the terms of the order may be expected to attract a legal challenge.</p><p>These circumstances of lawful authority can be examined through a simple decision tree process and flowcharts and often result in providing practitioners and legal representatives with a positive or negative outcome. The process of checking the legitimacy of evidence collected pursuant to a search warrant is set out in the flowchart shown in the following diagram. The process requires that all checks are met; otherwise, the information gathered may not be admissible. The practitioner must look to other forms of seizure under the legislation and owner's permissions and apply similar checks:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04931_09_06.jpg" alt="The comparative simplicity of the analysis of legal admissibility"/><div class="caption"><p>Flowchart to test conditions of the lawful acquisition of evidence</p></div></div><p>A sophisticated software process is not required in these instances, but examining other conditions of admissibility may require some structured guidance. This is especially so when<a id="id708" class="indexterm"/> determining the relevance of file-based events located on a computing device, as explained in the example in the next subsection.</p></div><div class="section" title="More complex components requiring scientific measurement"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl3sec02"/>More complex components requiring scientific measurement</h3></div></div></div><p>The <a id="id709" class="indexterm"/>relationship between files and operating and application systems involves complex dynamics and requires close scrutiny. The need for a more scientific measurement of digital evidence validity, as distinct from practitioners' or lawyers' intuition, is evident in more intricate or convoluted instances, when the nature of digital evidence can be misleading because of its properties.</p><p>Such properties include the examination of the file location; timestamps; creation, transfer, and storage antecedents; and other software and user-generated events that help reconstruct device or system usage. This becomes even more challenging to analyze when correlating file events (or their absence) and introduces a degree of uncertainty that must be measured in some way to determine the validity of the exhibit.</p><p>The assessments of evidential value that may be applied to untangling these complexities, if based on intuition and experience alone, may not be right. There may be a tendency for subjective and expedient treatment of the basic facts. Interpretations about relevance will also vary among practitioners with little or no thought to testing their hypotheses. There is certainly no central repository for practitioners to consult outside of their own organizations or teams, so a tendency for defensive egocentricity amongst some practitioners exists—hardly an ideal scientific setting, but there may be security reasons for not sharing such case details.</p><p>It has been demonstrated, for example, that web-based e-mail messages can be relatively easily falsified and supplanted, and with some basic knowledge, evidence of such intervention is easily obfuscated.</p><p>If, to highlight the model, we break down one of the conditions of admissibility, such as the relevance of the evidence, shown in the following diagram, there are seven identified subconditions that must be checked for relevance. If we take, for example, the subcondition <span class="strong"><strong>r7</strong></span>, the link between user and events is unequivocal and does not affect relevance.</p><p>There are a number of possible remote-access instances that should prompt the practitioner to verify whether the statement holds good. Checking for the likelihood of linkage between a suspected user and key events may require checking to determine whether other users had access to the computer through physical access, remote access through hacking, and other remote access through the presence of software applications such as TightVNC:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04931_09_07.jpg" alt="More complex components requiring scientific measurement"/><div class="caption"><p>Conditions of admissibility – relevance</p></div></div><p>These instances of<a id="id710" class="indexterm"/> possible remote access have the potential to show that a sole user did not have exclusive access to the computer, requiring more certainty to establish a link between a specific user and evidence of the transgression. In practice, the practitioner, as part of the case examination, should check all of these potential links. To illustrate the process, the following demonstration is set out using the hypothetical instance of measuring the likelihood of a remote-access exploit through the presence of software applications.</p><p>The flowchart<a id="id711" class="indexterm"/> is shown in the following diagram, which shows the process required to check applications and files to determine whether other user access occurred at times relevant to the transgression. The various outcomes of the checking process assist the practitioner in determining whether the evidence is admissible, because it is more likely than not that remote access did not occur. The results of the checking can also show that the evidence is less likely to implicate the computer owner as other user access is implied through remote access. The process may also show that the likelihood of other user access is uncertain or may not be possible to determine.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04931_09_08.jpg" alt="More complex components requiring scientific measurement"/><div class="caption"><p>The process of checking remote access through applications installed on a device</p></div></div><p>The overarching question is whether the remote application has been installed and used during a period the transgression took place. The practitioner may or may not confirm the existence of the application on the computer, because it may have been uninstalled or deleted without a trace and the logging files may not be present. If that proves inconclusive, checking other system records, such as the Event Viewer and Registry, may reveal the previous use of the application. Some indication that remote access was enabled by the application at or close to the time of the transgression of course raises the possibility of unauthorized use of the computer. This example is used to demonstrate the model's ability to process reasoned input and provide a useful output prognosis.</p><p>In this selected<a id="id712" class="indexterm"/> sample scenario, it is important to determine whether remote access applications were ever present on the computer. If this is confirmed, the implications this may have on the nature of transgression events should, as a matter of course, be considered. A diligent practitioner would check whether the application file metadata shows that the application was installed prior to the installation. If its previous installation were confirmed, then the focus would be on whether the application and system logs show that the application was used at the time of the transgression.</p><p>A positive response to evidence of the application running should trigger some alarm, and if other artifacts corroborate the use of the application at the time of the transgression, then the practitioner should consider the activities of another user of the computer.</p><p>If it can be established that the application was not used at the time of the transgression, this would allow the practitioner to conclude that this matter does not degrade the value of the evidence. Moreover, if the application has been present on the computer and not used, then there is no degradation of validity.</p><p>If, however, the application was installed, this would raise some concern as to its use at the time of the transgression and require further checking. The likelihood of the application degrading the evidence has increased and may be measured, the more so if it can be shown that it was installed and used at the time of the transgression. If its use was uncertain, this affects the likelihood ratio and has the implication of an uncertain prognosis.</p><p>If other evidence corroborates the application's use at the time of the transgression, a different likelihood ratio is presented. It is the cumulative result of these questions and the output measurements provided that allows the practitioner to gain an insight into the implications raised, but sometimes, the human brain needs extra help.</p></div><div class="section" title="Determining prior probability"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl3sec03"/>Determining prior probability</h3></div></div></div><p>Each hypothesis<a id="id713" class="indexterm"/> has a prior probability of being true, that is, the probability of that hypothesis being true before anything at all is known about the evidence that might be associated with it, and this may be modified at any time. Setting the prior probability in the hypothetical example of the vulnerability of a remote user exploit by the installation and operation of remote-access software on a target computer is the first priority.</p><p>Each subcategory in the model will have different thresholds to show the expert the different outputs.</p><p>In trying to determine whether there was a remote application to exploit the device, it may be decided that the probability of such an occurrence is infrequent or highly improbable, and other scales may be selected, but within the realm of reasonable expectation. The question is whether a remote application allowed an external exploit of the user's computer. The practitioner must decide whether the probability of such an event having taken place was infrequent, highly improbable, probable, most likely, and so forth. These predictions must be reasonable and within the bounds of what may be expected to occur on a computer.</p><p>If the <a id="id714" class="indexterm"/>occurrences are infrequent, a low threshold of prior probability of 0.01, which represents odds of exactly 1 in 100, may be selected. If the likely occurrence is greater, a higher threshold of prior probability of, say 0.1, which represents odds of exactly 1 in 10, may be selected. A lower threshold tells us that such an occurrence is infrequent, whereas a higher threshold suggests greater frequency.</p><p>There is flexibility embedded in the model to enable adjustments to meet criminal and civil standards of certainty, such as "beyond reasonable doubt" in criminal cases or "on a balance of probability" in civil cases. In criminal cases, if the evidence is not beyond reasonable doubt, then the defendant should get the benefit of the doubt.</p></div><div class="section" title="Setting post probabilities"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl3sec04"/>Setting post probabilities</h3></div></div></div><p>The next process<a id="id715" class="indexterm"/> is to determine the posterior or post probabilities based on alternative hypotheses. There are two items of evidence related to this proposition:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Was the remote application running at the time of the transgression?</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Do system logs confirm a remote application running at the time of the transgression?</li></ul></div><p>If either were running, this would suggest a measure of certainty that a remote user had accessed the computer at the time of the transgression (which may or may not be an unauthorized hack). We could set that probability at 0.8 or 8 in 10 for either. We could set the threshold at 1.0, which would mean that when either of these events occurred during the period of transgression, there was a certainty that a remote exploit had occurred. However, such certainty cannot be predicted without compelling corroboration.</p><p>At the other end of the scale, we can set it at 0.01, which means that odds of 1 in 100 that the application was running at the time of the transgression will be observed even if a remote application compromise does not occur. In the test sample, the prior probabilities were set at 0.1 and 0.01 to see whether there were any significant differences in calculating the output to these two questions. The post probabilities for each question were set at 0.8 and 0.1, as the significance of both questions was considered identical to determining the likelihood of a remote exploit.</p><p>These post <a id="id716" class="indexterm"/>probability ratios were calculated on the perception that if the answer to either question was in the positive, then the likelihood of a remote exploit was high, and if it was positive in both instances, highly probable. A higher threshold of 0.8 supported this measurement, while the 0.01 threshold was considered representative of the fact that the concept should not be dismissed to lightly.</p><p>The model presents these thresholds based on this question: Was the remote application running at the time of the transgression? In this case:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">A probability of 0.8 of observing the application running at the time of transgressions will be observed if it does</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">A probability of 0.01 of observing that the application was running at the time of transgressions will be observed even if a remote application compromise does not occur</li></ul></div><p>It will also consider this: Do system logs confirm remote application running at the time of the transgression? In this case:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">A probability of 0.8 of observing the system logs showing the application running at the time of transgressions will be observed if it does</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">A probability of 0.01 of observing system logs showing the application was running at the time of transgressions will be observed even if a remote application compromise does not occur</li></ul></div><p>The output from the model based on the complete range of responses to the prompts <span class="strong"><strong>Yes</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>No</strong></span>, and <span class="strong"><strong>Uncertain</strong></span> is shown in the following table. Some differences were observed between the use of the prior probability ratios of 0.1 and 0.01, as shown in the table.

<div class="section" title="Case study &#x2013; presumed unauthorized use of intellectual property"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl1sec72"/>Case study – presumed unauthorized use of intellectual property</h1></div></div></div><p>This recent <a id="id728" class="indexterm"/>case study exemplifies some of the problems that occur during examinations and provides some tips on avoiding certain pitfalls that occur.</p><div class="section" title="The background to the case"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl2sec160"/>The background to the case</h2></div></div></div><p>This was an industrial espionage case involving a member of staff who was suspected of stealing the intellectual property of the employer. Suspicion arose when the CCTV footage of the office detected the employee's presence at his workstation during out-of-office hours for a 2-hour period—unusual activity for staff members. Scrutiny of the CCTV footage showed a partial view of what appeared to be the employee's laptop, on which could be observed the opening of files on the desktop.</p><p>Examination of the company's server confirmed the download of a number of files, including images, spreadsheets, and some text documents, at the same time as the CCTV footage. The server logs also showed synchronization between the server and the e-mail account on the laptop. The employee's service was terminated 3 months later after the employer became aware that the employee was joining a rival company and of other innuendo as to his disloyalty.</p><p>Prior to the employee's departure, the company covertly installed an application on the laptop, its property, to monitor browsing activities of interest. The legality of this action is questionable. After the departure of the employee, the IT administrative staff carried out an examination of the laptop to seek information that might incriminate the employee. They installed various applications in an attempt to recover deleted files, but with no success. At this late juncture, the services of a forensic practitioner were sought to look for evidence to decide whether there were sufficient grounds to lodge a complaint to police.</p></div><div class="section" title="The forensic recovery"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl2sec161"/>The forensic recovery</h2></div></div></div><p>The laptop was<a id="id729" class="indexterm"/> subsequently examined, but it proved impossible to obtain a physical image of the hard drive by bootup or by removal of the drive, which appeared a tedious process with some risk of damage to the device. Ideally, a physical image will recover deleted data, but on this occasion, there was no guarantee that the operating system peculiar to the device installed on a solid-state drive would offer up much extra evidence.</p><p>Not all devices are amenable to recovery through the bootup process, and device removal, if possible, is a last resort. ISeekDiscovery installed on a specially configured external drive was proposed to capture a logical image of the device, but as the insertion of the drive may have overwritten the attached drive logs, this was of concern.</p><p>The company's legal team was advised that there may be some small contamination of the evidence, but that as the device had already been accessed by other personnel, the damage was done and the forensic process was unlikely to further contaminate the data to any greater extent. Permission was provided to proceed with the extraction, which was duly completed.</p></div><div class="section" title="The forensic examination"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl2sec162"/>The forensic examination</h2></div></div></div><p>The examination recovered some data, and the following observations were made:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">There was confirmation that the laptop was switched on during the period of the after-hours server download. The times matched other evidence relating to the employee's physical presence in the office workplace.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The location of a number of picture files that bore some resemblance to the information downloaded from the server was found. Some of the picture file names recovered from the laptop appeared be identical to those recorded in the server log.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Other picture files that appeared to be the intellectual property of the organization were located on the laptop.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">A number of similar filenames recorded in the server log were located on the laptop, but the timestamps did not match.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">A number of the filenames recorded in the server log were not located on the laptop.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">A number of e-mail and calendar files were located on the laptop and appeared to relate to the business of the organization.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">There was some evidence of cloning software on the device that indicated copying of the organization's property.</li></ul></div></div><div class="section" title="Linking the suspect to the device and the device to the server"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl2sec163"/>Linking the suspect to the device and the device to the server</h2></div></div></div><p>The IT <a id="id730" class="indexterm"/>administrator could not confirm that the files recorded in the server log were opened and accessed by the employee's laptop based on the IP address shown in the server log. According to the IT administrator, this was an IP address issued to various employees when they logged on to the server. However, despite an intensive search, no trace of this IP address was located on the laptop, which was most likely removed during the process of decommissioning the device after the employee's departure. The IT administrator also confirmed that apart from the IT administration team, no members of staff had remote access to the server. Confirmation that the IT administration had not accessed the server was made.</p><p>It was also recommended that a backup copy of the access log be retained as potential evidence. The CCTV footage of the office, but not the building in which it was housed, showed the employee in the workplace, whereas other staff were recorded as having earlier departed. The laptop was nondescript and had no identifying features to confirm that it was the one shown in the CCTV footage, even though the suspected employee could be seen using its keyboard. There was no record on the laptop showing any connections to the server other than what could be presumed from e-mail synchronization and data owned by the company, later identified through search terms.</p><p>Other data recovered for the date in question showed that the employee's e-mail account had been used to send and receive work messages. A plausible nexus between the employee, the laptop, and the server was established, which would be hard to contradict. However, confirmation that files were downloaded to the laptop and later used without authorization was not so straightforward.</p></div><div class="section" title="Analyzing the downloaded files"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl2sec164"/>Analyzing the downloaded files</h2></div></div></div><p>Only some of the files downloaded were recovered on the laptop, and the timestamps did not match the download time, with some pre-dating and others post-dating the server records. Similarly, none of the synchronized server e-mails shown in the log were located on the laptop.</p></div><div class="section" title="Connected storage devices"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl2sec165"/>Connected storage devices</h2></div></div></div><p>No information regarding the connectivity of an external device, such as a thumb drive or external storage device, was detected on the device prior to the period when the IT administration personnel installed data-recovery devices on the laptop. This information would have been helpful to determine whether an external device was used to copy the company's data.</p><p>This lack of connectivity logging may be attributable to these factors:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The operating system not maintaining a fuller list of previously attached devices, such as on Windows systems.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The IT administration team attaching external devices in an attempt to recover deleted files and examine the laptop prior to the forensic examination. This would have the effect of overwriting and removing any previous logging events.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">In the 3-month period between the date of the alleged transgression and the employee's departure, the system may have also recorded attached devices, but such events may have overwritten any earlier connectivity of relevance and shortly afterwards.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The<a id="id731" class="indexterm"/> log may have been manually deleted, but that would require some knowledge of its existence and some technical skill.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">USB ports were present on the left and right-hand sides of the keyboard close to the screen. Evidently, there was no reported sighting of any such connected devices based on the CCTV footage.</li></ul></div><p>No micro-SD card port was fitted to the laptop, and so, that process of data transfer was not available. Alternatively, if the pictures and other documents such as spreadsheets and PDF files were present on the desktop and deleted afterwards, it is unlikely they would be recovered if they had been deleted and then removed from the recycler—simply put, the evidence was not present.</p></div><div class="section" title="The illicit copying of data"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl2sec166"/>The illicit copying of data</h2></div></div></div><p>The installation files for a cloning application were located on the laptop after the alleged transgression, and earlier browsing records linked to the software website. The application makes a clone of the laptop, which means if it was used, it would allow the user to keep a full record of the data for possible future use. Data saved by such a process allows the user to reinstall the data on another machine and make the data available. It was not possible to determine whether the application was used to clone the device; however, the possibility exists that this may have occurred. Who loaded and installed the application could not be determined, and it may not have been the employee, as the integrity of the laptop data had been compromised, to some extent, by the handling of it by personnel prior to the forensic examination.</p></div><div class="section" title="The outcome"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl2sec167"/>The outcome</h2></div></div></div><p>There was some evidence that was recovered of the employee's most likely having possession of the company's property and using it to exploit business opportunities kept private from the company. Whether this information was sufficient to substantiate a case of theft or misuse of intellectual property is uncertain, but actually, it was not the concern of the practitioner. Why this unremarkable, but not uncommon, type of case is presented here is because it showed the company in a poor light and highlights some of the challenges confronting practitioners:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The client was suspect-driven and had already decided that the employee was guilty based on gossip and innuendo in the first instance, whereas the practitioner was evidence-led and neutral.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The client expected confirmation of these suspicions and was disappointed when the evidence was not clear-cut and decisive in part.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The evidence proves the suspicions to a point, but only to a point, and the case looked weak, with the client expecting that the forensics would provide more collateral—sometimes it does; sometimes it has the opposite effect.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The client asked that comments about evidence contamination be excised from the practitioner's report. This was refused on ethical and procedural grounds, with the client being sharply told that the practitioner was the servant of the court, not of the client, and was not an investigator subject to client manipulation. This denial by the practitioner was supported by the client's lawyer.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">There is some question about the lawfulness of installing a web-browsing tracking application on the laptop in this particular jurisdiction, which required a magistrate's warrant.</li></ul></div><p>Consider if <a id="id732" class="indexterm"/>you will, dear reader, that had the practitioner not made a full and honest account, the legal team would have charged ahead, ready to prosecute or litigate with a reasonable chance of cowing the employee into admitting some responsibility and guilt.</p><p>Had the practitioner succumbed and deleted the contamination information, it was suspected that the client would have filibustered the employee with what appeared to be a sound case, hoping to cower the employee into admitting the suspected transgression. But once the practitioner becomes aligned with the wishes of the client, it is a slippery slope into perdition. Often, the opposing legal team will discover that full and open disclosure of all the evidence was not made. This can result in the case being thrown out of court and the reputation of practitioner being damaged, perhaps permanently.</p></div></div>
