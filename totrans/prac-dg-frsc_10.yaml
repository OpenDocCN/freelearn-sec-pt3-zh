- en: This is a truly exciting and rewarding vocation—the skill of an investigator,
    the wisdom of a lawyer, and the knowledge of a computer analyst, all rolled into
    one. Being able to advise legal counsel or the investigation team on the outcome
    of an examination puts the practitioner in a unique and privileged position.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Irrespective of the outcome, the practitioner's advice cannot be ignored. It
    is not uncommon for the examination to reveal very little information of value;
    nothing had been present to recover in many instances. However, it is common for
    the client and lawyer to say that the venture was productive in that it could
    be set aside and the search for evidence could focus elsewhere. It is also pleasing
    to secure evidence that helps secure a conviction or acquittal too, depending
    on the party who engaged the practitioner.

    develop their own through case experience and court outcomes. The question is
    whether the standards are adequate and easy to interpret and apply in practice.
    Practitioners are constantly updating their knowledge of new and evolving applications
    and devices. Accumulating expertise is a journey of discovery for them.

    Evidence"), *The Nature and Special Properties of Digital Evidence*, presented
    processes for recovering data from devices using sophisticated tools such as ILookIX
    and described the nature of digital evidence: where it could be found, how it
    could be recovered, and how it could be used in an investigation. Much information
    was condensed into that chapter, all of which could fill a book in itself. It
    would suffice to say that an understanding of the characteristics of digital evidence
    is a prerequisite for an entrée to the discipline. Furthermore, digital evidence
    is not static: new types of files, applications, operating systems, storage repositories,
    communications networks, and processes emerge with surprising frequency.'

- en: The practitioner must keep up with these trends, yet little is published or
    shared, leaving it to the individual to explore new formats and processes and
    determine the best way to recover and process evidence. Exchanging discoveries
    is slow and tedious and usually restricted to publications and reviews, and they
    normally take an eternity to publish after peer review, are made into a quick
    blog post but not properly reviewed, or are kept "within house" because of confidentiality
    and privacy issues. This book does not provide encyclopedic coverage of digital
    evidence, but it has covered a considerable cross-section of the discipline.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The practitioner needs to be able to explain the properties of digital evidence
    and the role it plays in adding to the weight of a case but must ensure that it
    passes the admissibility rules. Explaining the soundness and authenticity of the
    evidence, as well as being able to provide some corroboration to assist the court
    in assessing its worth, goes beyond merely selecting and presenting the evidence,
    for it is the role of the practitioner to interpret and explain the full and likely
    meaning of the evidence and metadata to the layperson.

- en: As the discipline evolves and hopefully matures, it is practitioners who will
    lead the charge, but if they do not research and share any knowledge, it is going
    to be a ponderous exercise for them. Not all practitioners have the time even
    if they have the inclination to share their discoveries and experiences, and as
    mentioned before, there are confidentiality impositions too. In [Chapter 9](ch09.html
    "Chapter 9. Validating the Evidence"), *Validating the Evidence*, an evidence-validation
    process was introduced, and there may be merit in adopting such a process as a
    training tool for novice practitioners as well as a navigation tool for the more
    experienced. The process could be updated as new issues arise and used beyond
    its admissibility-checking design.

    have become ponderously complex, perhaps unnecessarily so, but in doing so, they
    do retain information about past transgressions that may have otherwise been erased.
    The challenge is knowing where to look—assuming the practitioner knows how to
    navigate new operating systems and applications.'

    searching are becoming untenable; the sheer size and complexity is time-consuming
    and not necessarily guaranteed to locate the evidence, except by chance in many
    instances. There will always be a place for "deep rinse" analysis, but there are
    more effective ways. My research and fieldwork has shown that while it is difficult
    to part with familiar processes such as these, there exists a better way of recovering
    potential evidence.

    investigations in addition to its role in e-discovery. The automaton is capable
    of recovering deleted files and registry files as well as collecting all specific
    file types. Several criminal defense cases have been tested using ILookIX and
    ISeekDiscovery, and the recovery rates were high, but ISeekDiscovery was able
    to capture just what was needed and was far more effective in cataloging and processing
    the recovered data.
  prefs: []

    the dataset, they fall short of the automaton's ability to seek and return results
    in shorter periods and undertake follow-up searches based on preliminary analysis.
    Putting this in an e-discovery and network setting, the automaton can be launched
    remotely and the results viewed securely and remotely for extraction to legal
    process teams. Savings in time, travel, expensive practitioners, and inherent
    system challenges are eliminated. This enables the practitioner to access and
    analyze evidence more quickly and devote more time to evidence analysis.

    evidence from an unabated increase in large and complex datasets. This requires
    a pragmatic approach to evidence recovery, and existing forensic tools for criminal
    and e-discovery do not achieve this. In my opinion, they are obsolete processes
    and really do not provide the support needed for speedy evidence analysis. This
    book has introduced new technologies and processes of preserving digital evidence
    and making recovery quicker and more reliable.

    from desktop, laptop, and networked computers for most criminal investigations.
    Mobile phones and other handheld devices require different data extraction processes.
    For e-discovery, where it is common to seek evidence from networked systems, imaging
    is impractical, and indexing and copying massive datasets using complicated software
    installed on the networks has been normal practice.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Imaging using existing technology does not provide the best protection for collected
    evidence. Mobile phone extraction tends to capture only logical data and now rarely
    recovers the physical data needed for deeper analysis. E-discovery is proving
    to be too costly for many organizations in terms of time, experts, and disruption
    to networks using existing data recovery tools.
  prefs: []

- en: Extracting data from tablets and even certain desktop devices is becoming problematic
    because of system encryption and difficulty in booting a device for imaging. They
    are becoming frequent stumbling blocks, making it difficult and sometimes impossible
    to recover data from these devices. My research colleagues are constantly finding
    ways to overcome these obstacles, but it is a sad fact that the discipline usually
    lags some way behind the introduction of new types of devices and systems.

    preserve evidence securely and conveniently. The `.ASB` forensic container format
    is the only forensic image type secured inside a container that is self-authenticating
    as well as tamper-proof. The peace of mind this gives a practitioner, who always
    faces the trauma of having the record of custody challenged, is that the logging
    process has provenance: its authenticity can be verified.'

    leaves no footprint of data on the system, and is relatively small compared with
    tradition e-discovery datasets. Not only are these tool processes soundly secure,
    but they are smaller in size, being compressed, and, in the case of the `.ISK`
    vaults, require significantly less storage space.

    and laptop computers, because they are portable, relatively affordable, and easy
    to use. Storage size is no longer a barrier to using these smaller devices because
    of the compactness of external storage media and the trend to store more personal
    and organizational data on remote servers such as the cloud.

    no safeguard for the privacy of data stored or transferred to and from these devices
    have unbridled access to private data, the main problem being the difficulty of
    recovering encrypted data. Other jurisdictions are more mindful of their citizens'
    right to privacy but still face the problem of recovering evidence from encrypted
    devices. The discipline is now probably at a watershed, with the storage of data
    being transformed into remote network hubs, less convenient to access than in
    the past and certainly infeasible to image!

    accomplish. Android and other operating systems are heading the same way. New
    models and versions now make it virtually impossible to recover a logical extraction
    of these phones unless the passphrase or PIN has been decoded or provided by the
    device owner—often not an option. The days of recovering a full physical dump
    containing erased data have long since passed for iPhones and Android devices.

    none seem close to dealing with the problem. Disappointingly, the vendors are
    unusually quiet as to what progress is being made to gain access to these devices.
    My research colleagues are working hard towards a solution to decrypt some of
    these devices and recover a physical dump capable of being processed by ILookIX
    and ISeek. ILookIX has been able to recover, for example, some 60 percent additional
    data from an iPhone 4 that other mobile forensics tools could not. It is hoped
    that this recovery success is extended to new versions of the iPhone. So, dear
    reader, keep an eye out for updates, particularly in light of the FBI versus Apple
    debacle regarding access to iPhones.

- en: Access to cloud resources to recover digital evidence is often through the normal
    access protocol used by consumers to connect to the host server, even if it is
    not owned by the consumer. However, it is not a simple matter to identify the
    path that the data takes from the source storage device to the target storage
    device, and this path may not remain fixed. Moreover, the owner of the data usually
    does not have physical control of the server where it is held, thus complicating
    the desired imaging of stored data, which may be stored in another jurisdiction
    and may require travel and extra resources. This also means that the data is accessed
    and recovered by a non-practitioner with limited understanding of what should
    be recovered and who may be unreliable in protecting the admissibility of the
    evidence.

    automaton, which is non-intrusive, can be launched remotely, is secure, and can
    segregate data to ensure compliance with court orders and warrants, compared to
    conventional recovery processes. These processes often require the server to be
    shut down for extended periods and can be intrusive and may contaminate the evidence
    and other data.

    mitigate the threat in advance or better manage the consequences after a security
    breach. An organization's IT team is often engaged in profiling the threat to

    are often the unwitting custodians of digital evidence later relied upon in court.
    Organizations are not always familiar with the complexity of digital evidence
    and how to locate and recover it without altering its integrity. Without some
    preparation for the eventuality of an incident requiring the preservation of digital
    evidence, it becomes problematic for organizations to handle evidence in the organization's

    digital evidence recovery firsthand and with depressing regularity, I note here
    that those organizations that have a forensic contingency plan recover more quickly
    from an incident, with a greater probability of bringing offenders to account.
    It is really a prudent strategy for organizations big and small to have some form
    of forensic response in addition to a security incident contingency plan. While
    existing risk-assessment standards may be useful, they generally do not encompass
    a digital forensics response.

    can be a costly experience and disruptive to an organization's information-management

    intimated in [Chapter 9](ch09.html "Chapter 9. Validating the Evidence"), *Validating
