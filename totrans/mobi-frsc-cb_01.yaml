- en: Initially, SIM cards were almost the only source of data about the contacts
    of the mobile device owner, as the information about the phonebook, calls, and
    messages could be found only in their memory. Later, the storage of these data
    was relocated to the mobile devices memory and SIM cards began to be used only
    to identify subscribers in cellular networks. This is why some of the forensic
    tools developers, for the examination of mobile devices, decided not to include
    the SIM cards examination function in their products. However, today there are
    a lot of cheap phones (often, we call them "Chinese phones") with limited memory
    capacity. In these phones, part of the phone owners' data is stored in the SIM
    cards. This is why the forensic examination of SIM cards remains relevant.

    on the contact pads. This happens because the two contacts do not directly interact
    with the phone (smartphone) and their absence decreases the size of the area occupied
    by a SIM card when it is placed in the mobile device.

- en: There is an overvoltage protection in SIM cards. This is why when a 3.3 V supply
    voltage SIM card is placed in the card reader, that can operate only with 5 V
    supply voltage (old models), neither the information nor the SIM card can be damaged,
    and it will be impossible to work with this SIM card. As such, an expert may think
    that the SIM card is faulty. However, it is not so.

    PUK codes is displayed in the program. If there were no attempts to unlock the
    SIM card, then there should be 3 attempts to enter the PIN code and 10 attempts
    to enter the PUK code. After 10 failed attempts to enter the PUK code, the SIM
    card will be blocked forever. The PUK code can be received from the communication
    provider through an authorized person.
