    the production of the first PDA, called Message Pad. These PDAs were equipped
    with an ARM processor, a touch screen, and handwriting recognition and were based
    on an operating system called Newton OS. The project was closed in 1997 when Steve
    Jobs returned to the helm of Apple.

- en: The real revolution and the starting point for the current success of iPhone
    and iPad has been the creation of the iPod devices and the iTunes software. These
    devices have completely changed the way each of us enjoys listening to music or
    multimedia content. Released in 2001, they were produced in different shapes,
    size, and capacity, from the first model presented on October 23, 2001 based on
    an ARM processor and 5 GB of capacity (Steve Jobs described it as, *a product
    that put, 1000 songs in your pocket*). The traditional iPods (iPod Classic, iPod
    Mini, iPod Nano, and iPod Shuffle) have already been the subject of previous publications
    in relation to the forensics acquisition and analysis of their content. We limit
    ourselves here to recalling that, from the point of view of the acquisition, an
    iPod can be treated as an external hard drive and acquired with traditional techniques
    of disk imaging. Regarding the filesystem it uses, it is either HFS+ or FAT32,
    depending on if it has been connected for the first time to a Mac or a PC. The
    audio files are stored in a hidden folder (typically in `\iPod_Control\Music\`)
    and organized inside a database. Other information that can be found within this
    type of device are contacts, calendar, and any other file in digital format that
    the user has decided to copy on the device, in a totally analogous way to an external
    device (pen drive, hard disk, and so on.). Using traditional techniques, it is
    possible to perform file carving, to recover deleted files and to create a timeline
    of the device usage.

    with Motorola and the production of the phone Rokr, the world's first integrated
    cellphone with iTunes. The device was not a great success, to the point that the
    project was shut down after only one year of life. However, this device has laid
    the foundations for the emergence of the iPhone.

    analysis of an iOS device. In the first part, the different types and models of
    the Apple devices are discussed, with an indication of the methodologies and techniques
    to accurately identify the model that you have to acquire. The second part analyzes
    the fundamental principles of the operating system (types, versions, and so on)
    and the type and structure of the filesystem used on these devices. In particular,

- en: The `allocation` (bitmap) file is used to keep track of which allocation blocks
    on a volume are currently allocated to a structure (file or folder). It is a bitmap
    that contains one bit for each allocation block in the volume. If a bit is 1,
    the corresponding allocation block is in use. If the bit is 0, the corresponding
    allocation block is not currently in use and is therefore available to be assigned
    to a file or folder.

    and folders on HFS+. A `catalog` file is organized as a binary tree (type B-tree)
    and therefore consists of head node, index nodes, and leaf nodes. The position
    of the first block of the `catalog` file (and thus the `head` node of the file)
    is stored in the `volume header` file. The `catalog` file contains the metadata
    of all the files and folders on a volume, including creation, modification and
    access date, permissions, file identifier, and information about the user that
    created the file.

    field defines the number of blocks allocated, the `extents` field stores the first
    eight extents of a file descriptor (an extent is a contiguous segment of a file).
    If a file requires a greater number of descriptor extents, these are stored in
    the `extents overflow` file. Each extent that composes a file is described in
    the `HFSPlusExtentDescriptor` data structure and is defined by the two fields

- en: The `startBlock` field identifies the first allocation block in an extent while
    the `blockCount` field identifies the length in the number of allocation blocks
    of an extent. The start offset of a file can then be determined by finding the
    first extent and multiplying the corresponding `startBlock` field to the size
    of the allocation block, which is defined in the `volume header` file. Since the
    files cannot always be completely stored in contiguous blocks on the disk and
    may be fragmented, `HFS+ dataFork` defines a structure that holds up to eight
    extents. When a file requires more than eight extents, it uses the `extents overflow`
    file, which combines the file with additional extents.
  id: totrans-224

- en: For the `extents overflow` file, if a file in an HFS+ volume is composed of
    more than eight extents (or is fragmented over more than eight contiguous positions
    of the volume), the extents in excess will be stored in the `extents overflow`
    file. The file structure is similar to the `content` file (binary tree, B-tree);
    however, it's greatly simplified by the presence of a single data structure (`HFSPlusExtentKey`).

    for a recovery process after a volume was not safely unmounted. This file stores
    file transactions (`create`, `delete`, `modify`, and so on) and might contain
    the same metadata stored in the attributes or in the `catalog` file. It is activated
    by default on the iOS devices and can be used to recover deleted content.

    file contains the text strings and Boolean values; in some cases, it can contain
    data encoded in the binary format, as shown in the following screenshot. Although
    they can be easily analyzed using a simple text editor, it is more convenient
    to browse the hierarchical structure through a dedicated reader. A complete description

    on recognition techniques based on the model number or hardware model number.
    It also contained an introduction to the iOS operating system with particular
    reference to the filesystem (HFSX), the partitions (system and data), and the
    main data structures (`property list` files and SQLite databases). These topics
    are the basics for forensic activity on an iDevice and will be useful inorder
    to understand the content of the next chapter, where you will learn various tools
    and techniques that you can use when dealing with acquisition and analysis.
