			<p>Nowadays, most companies have their IT environments hosted on the cloud, because that normally means better uptime, more resilience, faster deployment, lower risk, and even better security standards.</p>
			<p>However, this migration to the cloud also brings a plurality of risks and vulnerabilities that need to be assessed to keep your infrastructure secure.</p>
			<p>Therefore, in this chapter, we are going to start by discussing the different types of clouds and data (and how to keep them secure).</p>
			<p>Then, we are going to get even more technical by reviewing how to make your <strong class="bold">Kubernetes</strong> implementation more secure.</p>
			<p>Additionally, we are going to go over some best practices to harden your cloud databases and also discuss the best systems to monitor your cloud infrastructure.</p>
			<p>Here are the main topics that we will cover in this chapter:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Secure deployment and implementation of cloud applications</li>
				<li>Securing Kubernetes and APIs</li>
				<li>Hardening database services</li>
				<li>Testing your cloud security</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-251"><a id="_idTextAnchor265"/>Technical requirements </h1>
			<p>There are no technical requirements for this chapter, however, you can create free accounts to test some of the tools that we will review. Also, most of the cloud services offer free trials (tiers) that you can leverage to put the concepts into practice.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-252"><a id="_idTextAnchor266"/>Secure deployment and implementation of cloud applications </h1>
			<p>Almost<a id="_idIndexMarker1141"/> all companies have at least a portion of <a id="_idIndexMarker1142"/>their business on the cloud. However, each company is unique, and their implementation of cloud services could be a blend of the different cloud models available, as explained next.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-253"><a id="_idTextAnchor267"/>Security by cloud models</h2>
			<p>There are three types of <a id="_idIndexMarker1143"/>cloud models: <strong class="bold">Software as a Service</strong> (<strong class="bold">SaaS)</strong>, <strong class="bold">Platform as a Service</strong> (<strong class="bold">PaaS</strong>), and <strong class="bold">Infrastructure as a Service</strong> (<strong class="bold">IaaS</strong>). Each of these <a id="_idIndexMarker1144"/>models is very different from the others and <a id="_idIndexMarker1145"/>therefore the security measurements that need to<a id="_idIndexMarker1146"/> be applied vary for each of them. Therefore, let's start by doing a quick introduction to the three types of cloud environments to better understand what we are aiming to protect.</p>
			<h3>Software as a Service (SaaS) </h3>
			<p>This is<a id="_idIndexMarker1147"/> basically a piece of software loaded on the cloud that can be<a id="_idIndexMarker1148"/> easily accessed by the user through a web interface. Some examples are the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Web-based<a id="_idIndexMarker1149"/> emails<a id="_idIndexMarker1150"/> such as <strong class="bold">Gmail</strong> and <strong class="bold">Outlook</strong></li>
				<li>Web tools such as web-based billing systems or ticketing systems</li>
				<li>Web-based <a id="_idIndexMarker1151"/>productivity <a id="_idIndexMarker1152"/>applications such as <strong class="bold">Office 365</strong> or <strong class="bold">Google Workspace</strong></li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Platform as a Service (PaaS)</h3>
			<p>This provides a <a id="_idIndexMarker1153"/>platform for developers to create their own<a id="_idIndexMarker1154"/> apps. Some examples are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Containers <a id="_idIndexMarker1155"/>such as <strong class="bold">Docker</strong> and <strong class="bold">Kubernetes</strong></li>
				<li>Software <a id="_idIndexMarker1156"/>development repositories <a id="_idIndexMarker1157"/>and versioning control systems such as <strong class="bold">GitHub</strong></li>
				<li>Cloud-based platforms<a id="_idIndexMarker1158"/> such as <strong class="bold">Windows</strong> <strong class="bold">Azure</strong></li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) </h3>
			<p>This provides <a id="_idIndexMarker1159"/>the base architecture for system administrators<a id="_idIndexMarker1160"/> to create their own <a id="_idIndexMarker1161"/>systems and infrastructure. Some examples <a id="_idIndexMarker1162"/>are <a id="_idIndexMarker1163"/>as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Amazon Web Services</strong> (<strong class="bold">AWS</strong>)</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">DigitalOcean</strong></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Rackspace</strong></li>
			</ul>
			<p>In these cloud environments, security responsibilities are shared between the cloud users and the cloud provider. </p>
			<p>The following figure highlights who is responsible for the implementation of some security mechanisms based on the type of cloud in use:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_11.1_B16290.jpg" alt="Figure 11.1 – Cloud security responsibilities&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.1 – Cloud security responsibilities</p>
			<p>Now, let's have a look at how data security should be managed in cloud environments.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-254"><a id="_idTextAnchor268"/>Data security in the cloud</h2>
			<p>There are three<a id="_idIndexMarker1164"/> types (or states) of data in cloud environments: <strong class="bold">data at rest</strong>, <strong class="bold">data in transit</strong>, and <strong class="bold">data in use</strong> (<strong class="bold">memory</strong>). Therefore, you need to ensure that your data is always secure, regardless of the state. So, let's see the best practices to secure your data in all the different states.</p>
			<h3>Securing data at rest</h3>
			<p>Data at rest<a id="_idIndexMarker1165"/> is basically all the data stored in your cloud or cloud systems. The best way to secure data at rest is by using encryption, however, the application of encryption varies between the types of cloud as illustrated in the following figure:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_11.2_B16290.jpg" alt="Figure 11.2 – Encryption implementations based on the type of cloud &#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.2 – Encryption implementations based on the type of cloud </p>
			<p>Notice that for <strong class="bold">PaaS</strong> and <strong class="bold">SaaS</strong>, encryption of data at rest is mostly managed by the provider. Therefore, before<a id="_idIndexMarker1166"/> selecting a cloud provider, you <em class="italic">must</em> check with them whether they offer some kind of encryption for data at rest (remember that this also includes backups).</p>
			<h3>Securing data in transit</h3>
			<p>Data in transit is<a id="_idIndexMarker1167"/> basically all the flow of data between endpoints (from your machine to the cloud and vice versa). Securing this data is a bit more complex because it often requires some coordination between the cloud provider and the user.</p>
			<p>For example, <em class="italic">securing data in transit for SaaS</em> is normally achieved by using a secure protocol of transmission<a id="_idIndexMarker1168"/> such as <strong class="bold">SSL</strong> (<strong class="bold">HTTPS</strong>). As illustrated in the following figure, HTTPS prevents man-in-the-middle attacks by encrypting data in transit:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_11.3_B16290.jpg" alt="Figure 11.3 – Secure SSL connections versus HTTP&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.3 – Secure SSL connections versus HTTP</p>
			<p><em class="italic">Securing data in transit for PaaS</em> normally requires the user to perform some configuration on the cloud side, plus using some secure settings on the computer as well (for example, using a secure API to transfer data between the endpoint and the cloud). As seen in the following<a id="_idIndexMarker1169"/> figure, using an API key ensures end-to-end encryption between endpoint devices and the PaaS:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_11.4_B16290.jpg" alt="Figure 11.4 – Example of secure API key implementation in cloud &#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.4 – Example of secure API key implementation in cloud </p>
			<p><em class="italic">Securing data in transit for IaaS</em> is mostly done by the user by setting up secure channels to connect to their systems and infrastructure in the cloud, for example, using <strong class="bold">SSH</strong>.</p>
			<p>The following figure<a id="_idIndexMarker1170"/> shows the GUI of PuTTY, which is the most famous <strong class="bold">SSH client</strong> that<a id="_idIndexMarker1171"/> you can use to ensure that the communication with your cloud server is secure:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_11.5_B16290.jpg" alt="Figure 11.5 – PuTTY SSH client&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">  Figure 11.5 – PuTTY SSH client</p>
			<p>Now, let's look at the data <a id="_idIndexMarker1172"/>state that is normally overlooked but is super important to secure: <em class="italic">data in use</em>.</p>
			<h3>Securing data in use</h3>
			<p>Data in use is<a id="_idIndexMarker1173"/> basically the information in <strong class="bold">Random Access Memory (RAM)</strong>. In the past, this data was not considered as vulnerable, however, attackers discovered ways to retrieve information from memory, so it is important to ensure that mechanisms are in place to protect this data.</p>
			<p>The main way to protect this type of data is at the OS level by ensuring the server and applications are patched with the latest security updates to prevent any memory leak.</p>
			<p>SaaS users can apply some mechanisms to reduce the risks of these attacks, such as the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Close the cloud session when not in use.</li>
				<li>Log out from the web tool (instead of just closing the browser).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>PaaS users can apply the same best practices as SaaS users, plus also ensure that they use the latest version of the platform available and avoid the use of platforms with known vulnerabilities that can lead to a memory leak.</p>
			<p>IaaS users need<a id="_idIndexMarker1174"/> to go a step further by following these best practices:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Install the latest version of the OS.</li>
				<li>Perform regular patching of the OS.</li>
				<li>Keep all software up to date (especially with security updates).</li>
				<li>Remove any vulnerable software from the servers.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>We just covered the basics of cloud security. Now, it's time to move to a deeper topic to understand how we can enhance security when working with Kubernetes.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-255"><a id="_idTextAnchor269"/>Securing Kubernetes and APIs</h1>
			<p>Kubernetes is <a id="_idIndexMarker1175"/>one of the most used platforms to deploy cloud applications. Due to its <a id="_idIndexMarker1176"/>popularity, it is important that you understand the basics of securing Kubernetes to enhance the protection of your cloud environment. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-256"><a id="_idTextAnchor270"/>Cloud-native security</h2>
			<p>To better understand how <a id="_idIndexMarker1177"/>Kubernetes security relates to cloud security, let's look at the following figure, which explains the layered model of the <strong class="bold">four Cs</strong> of <strong class="bold">cloud-native systems</strong>: </p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_11.6_B16290.jpg" alt="Figure 11.6 – The four Cs of cloud-native security&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.6 – The four Cs of cloud-native security</p>
			<p>As seen in the<a id="_idIndexMarker1178"/> preceding figure, this is a layered model based on <a id="_idIndexMarker1179"/>the <strong class="bold">Defense in Depth</strong> (<strong class="bold">DiD</strong>) model, designed to enhance the security of cloud-based developments.</p>
			<p>The first line of defense is the cloud itself (a topic that we just covered), however, there are some specific aspects that you may take into consideration that are related to each cloud provider, so the best practice here is to check the page of your cloud provider to better understand their security capabilities.</p>
			<p>As a bonus, the following figure <a id="_idIndexMarker1180"/>provides links to the security pages of the main cloud providers:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_11.7_B16290.jpg" alt="Figure 11.7 – Security links for cloud providers&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.7 – Security links for cloud providers</p>
			<p>You can find<a id="_idIndexMarker1181"/> these links in the <em class="italic">Further reading</em> section, too. Now, the next layer is the cluster (in this case Kubernetes), so let's take a deep dive into the best practices to secure our Kubernetes.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-257"><a id="_idTextAnchor271"/>Controlling access to the Kubernetes API</h2>
			<p>Here, the<a id="_idIndexMarker1182"/> recommendation is to use <strong class="bold">Transport Layer Security (TLS)</strong> for all <strong class="bold">Application Programming Interface (API)</strong> traffic and make sure<a id="_idIndexMarker1183"/> that authentication, authorization, and admission controls are properly enabled and configured.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-258"><a id="_idTextAnchor272"/>Controlling access to kubelet</h2>
			<p>Requests<a id="_idIndexMarker1184"/> to the <strong class="bold">kubelet</strong> HTTPS endpoint (that are not rejected by<a id="_idIndexMarker1185"/> other configured authentication methods) <em class="italic">are treated as anonymous requests by default</em>.</p>
			<p>Therefore, the best practice here is to <em class="italic">enable authentication and authorization</em> on production clusters to prevent any security risk.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-259"><a id="_idTextAnchor273"/>Preventing containers from loading unwanted kernel modules</h2>
			<p>Attackers can <a id="_idIndexMarker1186"/>load kernel modules by creating a socket of the appropriate type that will enable the attacker to exploit a vulnerability on a kernel mode that the administrator assumed was not in use.</p>
			<p>To prevent this, you can uninstall the modules from the node, or blacklist them, by creating a file such as <code>/etc/modprobe.d/kubernetes-blacklist.conf</code> with contents such as the following:</p>
			<pre>blacklist dccp
blacklist sctp</pre>
			<p>If you want more <a id="_idIndexMarker1187"/>information about this command, visit the following site:<a href="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/6/html/deployment_guide/blacklisting_a_module">https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/6/html/deployment_guide/blacklisting_a_module</a>.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-260"><a id="_idTextAnchor274"/>Restricting access to etcd</h2>
			<p>Access to <strong class="bold">etcd</strong> must <a id="_idIndexMarker1188"/>be restricted because it is like giving root permissions in <a id="_idIndexMarker1189"/>the cluster. Therefore, here are two recommendations to prevent unauthorized access to etcd:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Use strong credentials from the API servers to the etcd server. And by strong password we mean a super long and crazy password that you can create and manage with a password vault. I've seen many people creating 12-digit passwords for this, which makes sense because they will be stored in a password vault, so go wild and create the biggest and strongest password possible.</li>
				<li>Use a separate etcd instance for non-master components.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Additionally, considering the sensitivity of etcd, another best security practice is that <em class="italic">only the API</em> should have access to it, and only grant permissions to those nodes that must have access to the etcd.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-261"><a id="_idTextAnchor275"/>Avoiding the use of alpha or beta features in production</h2>
			<p>You may find<a id="_idIndexMarker1190"/> very cool features for Kubernetes that are in an alpha or beta stage. In those cases, the recommendation is to wait until they are final before using them. </p>
			<p>Alpha or beta features may<a id="_idIndexMarker1191"/> have unresolved security flaws that may put your entire cluster in danger. It is important to mention that this tip in fact applies to all software and hardware (not just Kubernetes).</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-262"><a id="_idTextAnchor276"/>Third-party integrations</h2>
			<p>In a similar way to the previous tip, third-party integrations<a id="_idIndexMarker1192"/> may sound very cool and give you the feature that you were looking to implement, however, as with any other integration, you need to test those integrations before installing them in a production environment.</p>
			<p>Also, remember to always do a search about that integration on the internet to see what others say about them. Compatibility issues, vulnerabilities, and even crashes are some of the things that you will be glad to discover on the internet before they happen to you.</p>
			<p>Now, the other two<a id="_idIndexMarker1193"/> components of the four Cs of cloud-native system security are <strong class="bold">Code</strong> and <strong class="bold">Containers</strong>, which<a id="_idIndexMarker1194"/> are normally the responsibility of the <em class="italic">developers</em>. However, as a cybersecurity professional, it would be good to ensure that the development teams are following at least some sort of framework for secure code development to reduce the risks in your cloud environment.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-263"><a id="_idTextAnchor277"/>Hardening database services</h1>
			<p>Getting access to the <a id="_idIndexMarker1195"/>databases is probably the most wanted treasure for an attacker.</p>
			<p>And this is not just because of the data they can access, but because by getting access to those databases, the attacker may gain access to other systems, create new users, and more.</p>
			<p>Now, you have to consider that when talking about databases, we are talking about a huge field in which each system and technology may have its own hardening steps. Therefore, it is better for you to understand agnostic best practices that apply to most databases, as presented here:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Basic security<a id="_idIndexMarker1196"/> settings such as encryption and auditing must always be <em class="italic">on</em>.</li>
				<li>Use advanced tools to monitor, detect, and deny access to data (if possible, look for new solutions that include AI components to enhance the detection of intrusions).</li>
				<li>Administrative accounts (such as <strong class="bold">DBA</strong> accounts) must use a stronger password criteria (when possible, 60+-character passwords and a password manager).</li>
				<li>Always apply basic security policies such as <strong class="bold">principle of least privilege (PoLP)</strong> and segregation of duties (they are explained in detail in <a href="B16290_03_Final_JC_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor068"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></a>, <em class="italic">Comprehending Policies, Procedures, Compliance, and Audits</em>).</li>
				<li>Database segregation may help you better control the data and the associated controls. For example, segregate databases based on regulatory controls.</li>
				<li>Always determine whether the data will be accessed internally or externally and apply the controls appropriately.</li>
				<li>Analyze and, if possible, leverage the security features provided by the cloud provider.</li>
				<li>Analyze and, if possible, leverage the security features provided by the database developer.</li>
				<li>Leverage compliance standards to improve the security of your databases even if you don't need to comply with them (for example, <strong class="bold">PCI-DSS</strong>).</li>
				<li>Avoid the use of customer data in test environments.</li>
				<li>When possible, use a policy manager to enforce your security policies.</li>
				<li>Use enhanced solutions (such as <strong class="bold">Google Secret Manager</strong>) to store sensitive information such as API keys, passwords, certificates, and more.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Now that you know how to secure your cloud, it's time to have a look at some tools that you can leverage to test the security of your cloud.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-264"><a id="_idTextAnchor278"/>Testing your cloud security</h1>
			<p>As you must know <a id="_idIndexMarker1199"/>already, all defensive security measurements <em class="italic">must</em> be tested to confirm whether the implemented controls are effective, but also to detect whether there is any potential hole that can be exploited by attackers.</p>
			<p>Therefore, in this section, we will explore the best tools that you can use to monitor your cloud in terms of availability and vulnerabilities to confirm that your controls are effective, but also to determine whether they are in compliance with a given regulation.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-265"><a id="_idTextAnchor279"/>Azure Security Center</h2>
			<p><strong class="bold">Azure Security Center</strong> is a <a id="_idIndexMarker1200"/>must if you have your cloud hosted with Microsoft, as it allows you to assess the security state of all your cloud resources, including servers, storage, SQL, networks, applications, and workloads. </p>
			<p>As seen in the following figure, here, you can visualize your security state and even improve it by using Azure <strong class="bold">secure score</strong> recommendations:</p>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.8 – Azure Security Center</p>
			<p>Additionally, <a id="_idIndexMarker1201"/>Azure Security Center enables you to view your compliance against a wide variety of regulatory requirements and perform ongoing assessments and reports to simplify compliance.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-266"><a id="_idTextAnchor280"/>Amazon CloudWatch</h2>
			<p><strong class="bold">Amazon CloudWatch</strong> monitors<a id="_idIndexMarker1202"/> cloud applications and converts the data into metrics and events to provide better visibility of AWS resources, applications, and services.</p>
			<p>Additionally, you can also detect anomalous behaviors, configure alarms, execute automatic actions, and more.</p>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-271"><a id="_idTextAnchor285"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we covered a lot of useful information to help you better understand all the aspects related to a secure cloud implementation.</p>
			<p>We learned about the different types of cloud and their associated security and we also saw how to secure Kubernetes. We finished by showing you some basics about database security and all the different tools available to assess the security of your cloud (before the bad guys do).</p>
			<p>But we are not done yet. In the next chapter, we are going even deeper into this topic by learning how to master the implementation of security using web apps.</p>
