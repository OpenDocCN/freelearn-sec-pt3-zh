- en: This section will cover forensics on Windows phones – right from understanding
    the Windows Phone OS to data extraction from the device. The last chapter will
    cover how to perform forensics on some of the most widely used third-party apps,
    such as Facebook, WhatsApp, and so on. We will look at how data is organized within
    these apps and some of the techniques that can be readily applied to extract the
    data within them.
