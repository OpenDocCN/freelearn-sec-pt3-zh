    has specifically trained professionals who are tasked with responding to emergency
    situations with specialized equipment to contain and eradicate a fire. In order
    to engage a fire department, a citizen must contact emergency services and provide
    key information, such as the nature of the emergency, the location, and whether
    any lives are in danger. From here, this information is passed on to the fire
    department, which dispatches resources to the emergency.

    the SOC is responsible for the management of the security tools that monitor the

    has a greater degree of visibility into what the SOC is seeing and doing. Furthermore,
    having the SOC embedded within the CSIRT allows the CSIRT manager and their team
    to craft more efficient policies and procedures related to incidents. A second
    distinct advantage of this approach is that the incident escalation is completed
    much faster and likely with greater precision. With the SOC analyst directly escalating
    to the next tier of CSIRT personnel, the entire process is much faster, and a
    more detailed analysis is performed as a result.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    and not outsourced. For organizations making use of a network operations center
    or a helpdesk, and without a dedicated SOC, this approach is not realistic, as
    those functions are often managed outside of the CSIRT or even the network security
    teams. One other issue is that, depending on the size of the SOC and CSIRTs, additional
    CSIRT managers may be required in order to address the day-to-day workload of
    both the SOC and the CSIRT.

    technologies. The SOC models will often use a **Security Information and Event
    Management** (**SIEM**) system to provide network visibility and detect intrusions

    Orchestration, Automation, and Response** (**SOAR**), which is discussed later
    in this chapter. Both tools provide network visibility and the ability to quickly
    pivot to key systems during an incident.

    integration is a relatively new methodology, as well as it being resource intensive.
    Very few organizations have the resources in either technology or personnel to
    make this type of structure effective. Pulling in full-time threat intelligence
    analysts, as well as various paid and open source feeds (and the technology to
    support them), is often cost-prohibitive. As a result of this, there are not many
    organizations that can leverage a full-time threat intelligence analyst as part

    may contact an organization to indicate that a C2 server has been taken down.
    During an analysis of that system, the external IP address of the organization
    has been identified. From this data point, the scope is first defined as the entire
    network. From here, the CSIRT would analyze data from the firewall or web proxy
    to identify the internal systems that were found to be communicating with the
    C2 server. From this data, they would narrow down the initial scope of the incident
    to those systems that had been impacted.'

    patient zero, or the first system that was compromised. In some incidents, this
    may be easy to discover. A phishing email containing a PDF document that, when
    opened, executes malware can be easily identified by the user or security control.
    Other attacks may not be so obvious. While finding patient zero does provide a
    good deal of data for root-cause analysis, it is more important to identify the
    scope of the incident first, rather than looking for a single system.

    of the incident. Those that have been exposed to the fundamental concepts of information
    security will be well familiar with the **CIA triad**. The CIA triad represents
    the elements of security within an information system: **confidentiality**, **integrity**,
    and **availability**. Any breach or violation of security will have an impact
    on one or more of these elements. For example, a ransomware incident that impacts
    15 production servers impacts the availability of the data on those systems. Impacts
    on availability that are related to the incident, either occurring as a direct
    result, due to adversary actions, or the time it takes to respond and remediate,
    are important factors to determine the incident’s impact. Other incidents, such
    as the theft of intellectual property, impact the confidentiality of data. Finally,
    incidents involving unauthorized manipulation of source code or other data impact

    the same type of response as when discovering credit card-harvesting malware within

    their infrastructure. If an incident has occurred that causes an impact, there
    will be a need to understand how it happened. The goal of an incident investigation
    is to determine what sequence of events, vulnerabilities, or other conditions
    were present that led to the incident and its impact. Often, the root cause of
    an incident is not a simple vulnerability but a sequence of events and conditions
    that allowed an adversary to penetrate security systems and conduct their attack.

    they are corrected, or otherwise controlled.'

    ([*Chapter 17*](B18571_17.xhtml#_idTextAnchor304) will address attribution as
    far as it relates to incident response), resources are better off spent on investigating
    or containing an incident. Attempting to ascertain the group or groups responsible
    for an attack is time-consuming, with few positive returns. If the organization’s
    leadership is adamant about determining attribution, the best approach is to comprehensively
    document the incident and pass off the data to a third party that specifically
    addresses attribution. Such organizations often combine data from several incident
    investigations to build a dossier on certain groups. If the data supplied matches
    the activities of one of these groups, they may be able to provide some context
    in terms of attribution.

    simpler term is a war room. A war room can be set up as necessary; or, in some

    communicate within a larger organization during an incident. With email, instant
    messaging, and voice calls, it may seem as though organizations already have the
    necessary tools to appropriately communicate internally. These communication platforms
    may need to be set aside in the event of an incident impacting user credentials,
    email systems, or other cloud-based collaboration platforms. For example, a common
    attack observed is the Office 365 cloud-based email being compromised. If attackers
    have gained access to the email system, they may have also compromised associated
    instant messaging applications, such as Skype. Given this, relying on these applications
    during an incident may, in fact, be providing the attackers with an insight into
    the actions of the CSIRT.

    business units need to be part of communications. The legal department will need
    to be kept abreast of the incident, as they will often have to determine reporting
    requirements and any additional regulatory requirements. Marketing and communications
    can be leveraged for crafting communications to external parties. This can best
    be facilitated by including them as early as possible in the process so that they
    have a full understanding of the incident and its impact. If the incident impacts
    any internal employees, Human Resources should also be included as part of internal
    communications.

    and how they are addressing the incident.

    ensure orderly communications and limit misinformation. To limit confusion, the
    IC or CSIRT lead should serve as a single point of contact. This way, for example,
    the legal department does not contact a CSIRT analyst to receive information about
    an investigation that is, at that time, speculative. Relying on this type of information
    can lead to serious legal consequences. To keep everyone informed, the CSIRT lead
    or IC should conduct periodic updates throughout each day of the incident. The
    cadence of these communications is dependent on the incident type and severity,
    but having a cadence of every 4 hours, with a conference call during the working
    hours of 6 a.m. to 10 p.m., will ensure that everyone is kept up to date.

    been obtained, and any potential factors that may limit the ability of the CSIRT
    to function. At a minimum, a daily status meeting, in conjunction with this report,
    should be conducted with senior leadership and any other personnel that is required

    to specific systems or areas of the network. It is critical for organizations
    to have prepared these in the event of an incident. The rise of ransomware that
    combines elements of viruses and worms that can quickly spread through an organization
    highlights the need to rapidly contain an outbreak before it impacts too many
    systems. What compounds the challenge of containment is that many enterprise IT
    systems utilize a *flat* topology, whereby the bulk of systems can communicate
    with each other. In this type of environment, ransomware and other worms can quickly
    propagate via legitimate protocols, such as `https://cve.mitre.org/cgi- bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-0144`.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    the network topology. This type of network awareness can be achieved through outputs
    of network discovery tools, up-to-date network diagrams, system inventories, and
    vulnerability scans. This data should be shared with the CSIRT so that an overall
    view of the network can be achieved. From here, the CSIRT should coordinate containment
    plans with network operations personnel so that an overall containment strategy
    can be crafted, and the potential damage of an incident limited. Having network
    operations personnel as part of the technical support personnel goes a long way
    in ensuring this process is streamlined and containment is achieved as quickly
    as possible.

    incident management is that of change management. Mature IT infrastructures usually
    have a well-documented and governed change management process in place. During
    an incident, however, the CSIRT and support personnel cannot wait for change management
    authorization and a proper change window to implement changes. When exercising
    containment strategies, IT and organizational leadership should fully understand
    that changes are going to be made based on the incident. This does not absolve
    the CSIRT and IT personnel from exercising due care and ensuring that changes
    are well documented.

    is removed from the system. This can be as simple as unplugging the network cable,
    disabling wireless access, or disabling the connection through the operating system.
    While this sounds simple, there are several factors that can make this strategy
    challenging for even the smallest organization. The first is the ability to physically
    locate the systems impacted. This may be a simpler task inside a data center where
    the impacted systems are in the same rack, but attempting to physically locate
    20 to 30 desktops in a fairly corporate environment takes a great deal of effort.
    In the time that it would take to remove 20 systems from the network, the malware
    could have easily spread across to other systems. Further compounding the difficulty
    of physical containment is the challenge of addressing geographically diverse
    systems. Having a data center or other operating site an hour’s drive away would
    necessitate having an individual on that site to perform the physical containment.
    As you can imagine, physically containing a malware outbreak or another incident
    can be very difficult if the scope of the incident is beyond the capability of
    the CSIRT. Physical containment should be reserved for those incidents where the
    scope is limited and the CSIRT personnel can immediately remove the systems from
    the network.'

    strategy, the network administrator(s) will be tasked with modifying switch configurations
    to limit the traffic from infected systems on a subnet to other portions of the
    network. This containment strategy may require modification of configurations
    on individual switches or using the management console. One aspect of this approach
    that needs to be addressed is how the organization handles change control. In
    many organizations, it is common practice to review any switch configuration changes
    as part of the normal change control process. There needs to be an exception written
    into that process to facilitate the rapid deployment of switch configuration changes
    during a declared incident. Network administrators should also ensure that any
    changes that are made are properly documented so that they can be reversed or
    otherwise modified during the recovery phase of an incident.'

    conjunction with network containment in a Russian nesting-doll approach, where
    the CSIRT contains network traffic at the perimeter and works its way to the specific
    subnets containing the impacted systems. For example, malware will often download
    additional code or other packages via tools such as PowerShell. In the event that
    the CSIRT has identified the external IP address that is utilized by the malware
    to download additional packages, it can be blocked at the firewall, thereby preventing
    additional damage. From here, the CSIRT can then work backward from the perimeter
    to the impacted systems. The organization can then leave the rule in place until
    such time that it is deemed no longer necessary. As with network containment,
    it is important to address any change control issues that may arise from making
    changes to the firewall ruleset.'

    in the event that an incident may need to be contained. First, hypervisor software
    such as VMware’s ESXi platform can be utilized to remove the network connection
    from multiple systems at once. Organizations may also make use of virtual switching
    in much the same way as physical switches in terms of containment. Finally, virtualization
    software allows for the pausing of systems during an incident. This is the preferred
    method, as suspending or pausing a virtual machine during an incident preserves
    a good deal of evidence that can be examined later.'

    to ensure that all malicious code has been removed. In the past, organizations
    could simply scan the system with an antivirus program to trace the offending
    malicious code. Now, with malware techniques such as process injection or DLL
    hijacking, even if the original code is removed, there is still a chance that
    the system is still infected. There is also the possibility that additional code
    that has been downloaded is also installed and will go undetected. As a result,
    most eradication strategies rely on taking infected machines and reimaging them
    with a known good image or reverting to a known good backup.

    of the infected systems onto a secondary staging VLAN. The system is then reimaged
    with a known good image, or a known good backup is utilized. From here, once the
    system has been reimaged or has the backup installed, it is then moved to a production
    VLAN, where additional monitoring is conducted to ensure that there is no remaining
    infection or compromise. The following diagram shows a simple network structure

    be connected to the VLAN with enhanced monitoring. It is important that in the
    case of reverting to snapshots, the CSIRT has a great deal of confidence in the
    timeline. If the CSIRT is unsure about the timeline of an attack, there is a possibility
    that the snapshot may be compromised as well. This is especially true in organizations
