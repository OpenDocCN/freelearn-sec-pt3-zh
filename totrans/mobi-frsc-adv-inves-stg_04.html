    <p>When approaching an Android smartphone, there is no straightforward route to acquisition. Due to extremely high fragmentation of the Android platform, your approach to acquiring an Android smartphone will vary greatly between devices. Your approach will depend on who made the device and what chipset was used; what version of Android it is running and what version of Android it was originally released with; whether or not the device has an unlocked (or unlockable) bootloader, and whether it was or can be rooted. If that's not enough, you'll have different options depending on the encryption status of the device (which also depends on the device's make, model, and version of Android).</p>

    <p>This chapter offers detailed discussion and demonstration of the various physical acquisition methods available for a wide range of Android devices. We'll discuss how to use manufacturer-specific low-level service modes (LG, Qualcomm, and Mediatek), how to use custom recoveries (<span class="strong"><strong>ClockworkMod</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>CWM</strong></span>) and <span class="strong"><strong>Team Win Recovery Project</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>TWRP</strong></span>)) for dumping the data partition, and how to make NANDroid backups and use command-line tools such as <span class="strong"><strong>dd</strong></span> for live-imaging the device. We'll talk about encryption and its effect on physical acquisition.</p>

      <p>When approaching an Android smartphone, there is no straightforward route to physical acquisition. Is the device encrypted? Do you happen to know the passcode? Do you have a bootloader that is unlocked (or at least semi-unlocked)? Does the device have root access installed, or do you have the means to root it? Is a service backdoor available on a particular model? Depending on these factors, you may be able to pursue one or another acquisition method.</p>

        <p>Before we go on discussing the various physical acquisition methods, let's make one thing clear: device encryption may affect your ability to access user data. There may be a possibility to extract decryption keys, which in turn, depends on the version of Android and whether or not the phone was made by Samsung.</p>

        <p>Prior to Android 5.0 <span class="emphasis"><em>Lollipop</em></span>, Google used to utilize (and push to <span class="strong"><strong>Android Open Source Project</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>AOSP</strong></span>)) a seriously flawed encryption method. This method was compromised as experts were able to extract decryption keys from the device and use it to decrypt user data. Decryption metadata was kept unencrypted, thus extracting the metadata made it possible to decrypt the data partition.</p>

        <p>Samsung knew of this vulnerability and designed its own proprietary encryption scheme that encrypted the decryption metadata. As a result, encrypted Samsung smartphones are a tough call even if they are running an early version of Android (pre-Lollipop).</p>

        <div class="note" title="Note" style="">

          <div class="inner">

            <h3 class="title" id="toc_3"><a id="note12"/>Note</h3>

            <p>Samsung devices running Android 4.0 and earlier used open decryption metadata, and can be acquired even if encrypted. Samsung Galaxy Nexus running stock Android used Google's standard encryption implementation (with open decryption metadata) and can also be decrypted.</p>

          </div>

        </div>

        <p>In Android 5.0, Google adopted a much more secure encryption scheme, similar to the one developed by Samsung. In Android 5.x and 6.x, decryption metadata is no longer stored in an open form. Instead, the decryption metadata is securely encrypted. While decryption metadata can be extracted via physical imaging, JTAG, or chip-off, it is impossible to use it to decrypt the data partition since the required metadata itself is encrypted. At this time, no method exists to decrypt the required metadata off-device. Samsung is now using this encryption standard in devices running Android 5.x and newer. When acquiring an encrypted Android device, the following compatibility matrix applies:</p>

        <div class="itemizedlist">

          <ul class="itemizedlist">

            <li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">For <span class="strong"><strong>encrypted non-Samsung devices running Android 4.4 KitKat</strong></span> or earlier, you may be able to recover the decryption key and use it to decrypt the user data.</li>

            <li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">For <span class="strong"><strong>encrypted Samsung smartphones running Android 4.0 through 4.4</strong></span>, you may be unable to extract or recover the decryption key. As a result, you may be unable to decrypt the user data. If this is the case, you can still try live imaging, logical acquisition, or cloud extraction.</li>

            <li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">For <span class="strong"><strong>encrypted devices running Android 5.x or newer</strong></span>, you are unlikely to discover the decryption key. Lower-level acquisition techniques (JTAG, ISP, or chip-off) will be equally useless. Attempt live imaging, logical acquisition, or cloud extraction.</li>

          </ul>

        </div>

        <p>Now that we have this clear, let's move on to actual acquisition techniques.</p>

    <p>When approaching a device, you may want to consider the following:</p>

    <div class="itemizedlist">

      <ul class="itemizedlist">

        <li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Some manufacturers ship their devices with fully or partially unlocked bootloaders. Imaging such devices usually presents no problem (unless data is encrypted).</li>

        <li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Some manufacturers ship their devices with locked bootloaders, officially allowing users to unlock them (for example, Samsung, Motorola, SONY, Nexus devices, and many others). If the user unlocked the bootloader, there is a high probability of successful imaging (unless an anti-forensic technique was employed).</li>

        <li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">In many cases, manufacturers and/or carriers restrict bootloader unlocks. In some cases, it is possible to bypass these restrictions in some models (the chipset and manufacturer of the device are important). Some chipset makers and device OEMs have backdoors (used for service-level access), while some can be exploited to bypass bootloader lock and boot into a custom recovery (which does not necessarily mean that you can permanently flash one). These devices are also relatively easy to acquire.</li>

        <li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Finally, some devices are really tough. Locked bootloaders, no service mode, and no known exploits make them difficult to acquire. You can still try live imaging or alternative acquisition methods.</li>

      </ul>

    </div>

    <p>If you are using Cellebrite UFED, you may find it useful to install their free mobile app (onto your own smartphone or tablet) to help you identify the extraction capabilities of a given mobile device. <span class="strong"><strong>UFED Phone Detective</strong></span> is available for iOS and Android devices, and offers an easy way to view forensic extraction and decoding capabilities, as well as connectivity methods, for mobile devices supported by Cellebrite UFED 4PC/Touch/Classic. While the app can be downloaded free of charge, you will need to provide your <span class="strong"><strong>My Cellebrite</strong></span> credentials to log in. If you don't have a My Cellebrite account, you will be able to register free of charge from within the app:</p>

      <p> <span class="strong"><strong>Yes</strong></span>: If you're imaging a Samsung device, and if that device runs Android 4.0 to 4.4, or if you're imaging a Samsung or non-Samsung device that runs Android 5 or newer, try live imaging. In order to perform live imaging, you will need to unlock the device with the correct passcode (plenty of solutions are available on the market). If you are imaging an older <span class="emphasis"><em>non-Samsung</em></span> device that runs a version of Android 4.4 or earlier, proceed to physical acquisition as you have a good chance of recovering the decryption key.</p>

        </div>

        <p>LG smartphones ship with a proprietary service access mode called <span class="strong"><strong>LAF</strong></span>. In LG smartphones, this proprietary mode completely replaces similar low-level access modes provided by chipset makers, such as Qualcomm or MediaTek. This bears an important consequence. If you are imaging an LG smartphone, make sure that you use the LG service mode instead of attempting to boot the device into Qualcomm 9006 or MTK service mode.</p>

        <p>LG service mode works both ways (for reading and writing data onto the raw physical storage). As a result, you can image the complete physical storage regardless of the bootloader lock status. LG uses a proprietary protocol, so your acquisition tool must support that in order to be able to read the data. You will need to install the latest LG drivers as well. Tools that support LAF include Cellebrite UFED and Oxygen Forensic Suite. More on this method will be discussed in the <span class="emphasis"><em>LG smartphones' LAF mode</em></span> section.</p>

          </div>

        </div>

        <p>A number of vendors build devices based on reference platforms supplied by chipset manufacturers. Using a reference platform greatly streamlines development. Manufacturers receive a ready-to-use PCB design complete with pre-selected components and drivers. In addition to this, some reference platforms expose service-access backdoors. The reference platform provided by Qualcomm, one of the largest chipset manufacturers, includes several service modes. One of these modes, <span class="strong"><strong>HS-USB 9006</strong></span> or <span class="strong"><strong>mode 9006</strong></span>, provides system-level access to device partitions regardless of whether the device ships with a locked or unlocked bootloader.</p>

        <p>Generally speaking, switching into this mode is activated by turning the device off, connecting it to the computer via a USB cord while holding the volume up key, and powering on the device while still holding the volume up key (details on entering mode 9006 may vary slightly between devices). Once the device boots into the service mode, the Windows <span class="strong"><strong>Disk Management</strong></span> console will display a list of available partitions. Note that a dedicated Qualcomm Download Mode HS-USB 9006 driver must be installed on the expert's computer for the partitions to appear. Once you see the list of partitions, you'll be able to image these partitions with a mobile forensic tool of your choice. Some flash imaging tools are also available. More on this method will be discussed in <span class="emphasis"><em>The Qualcomm 9006 mode</em></span> section.</p>

        <p>Another chipset manufacturer providing a special service backdoor is <span class="strong"><strong>MediaTek</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>MTK</strong></span>). MTK chipsets are used by most Chinese smartphone makers and include models built by Xiaomi, Meizu, Oppo, Vivo, OnePlus, Cubot, Zoppo, ZTE, No. 1, and hundreds of B-brands and C-brands. Unlike Qualcomm, MediaTek only allows accessing data via this service mode if the bootloader is unlocked. Many Chinese manufacturers ship their smartphones with unlocked bootloaders, presumably for easier servicing, which allows users of mobile forensic tools to easily image these devices by exploiting the MTK service mode. Later in this book, we'll discuss more about one of the tools, Oxygen Forensic Toolkit. More on this method is discussed in the <span class="emphasis"><em>MediaTek smartphones</em></span> section.</p>

        </div>

        <p> <span class="emphasis"><em>Is the bootloader locked?</em></span> When it comes to acquiring Android devices, this is a major question. Major brands ship their Android devices with locked bootloaders. Some vendors allow users to unlock bootloaders on some models and carrier combinations, while other vendors (models and carriers) opt for permanently locked bootloaders.</p>

        <p>The majority of Android devices sold in the US and Europe ship with locked bootloaders; in China, the opposite is true. Some devices come with semi-locked bootloaders, allowing to boot into (but not permanently flash) a custom boot image. If you are able to boot into a custom recovery, you may be able to create a Nandroid backup or image the data partition. However, note that booting into a custom bootloader on a semi-unlocked bootloader may (InFocus m810t) or may not (ASUS ZenPad S 8.0) trigger a security reset.</p>

        <p> <span class="emphasis"><em>Is the device rooted?</em></span> Unlike iOS jailbreak, rooting the device is not a necessary prerequisite for imaging many Android devices.

      </div>

      <p>For service purposes, LG developed a low-level protocol enabling LG smartphones to accept firmware updates over a USB connection even if the device is not otherwise accessible (<span class="emphasis"><em>bricked</em></span>). Initially only available to authorized service centers, details of this protocol and the actual drivers and flashing tools soon became available to the general public, and made it into some mobile forensic tools such as Cellebrite UFED and Oxygen Forensic Suite (refer to the <span class="emphasis"><em>Live imaging using Oxygen Forensic Suite</em></span> section for more information).</p>

      <p>This service mode (LAF mode) is generally activated by powering down the device, holding the volume up key and attaching it to the PC via a USB cable. The phone will automatically boot into the download mode, ready to accept firmware updates:</p>

      <p> </p>

      <p>MediaTek is a Chinese manufacturer supplying a large number of phone makers with cost-effective mobile chipsets. Mostly used in low-end and mid-range devices, MTK chipsets can be found in smartphones and tablets produced by major manufacturers (LG, SONY, HTC, and so on), as well as a countless number of B-brand and C-brand manufacturers.</p>

      <p>C-brand devices sold in Mainland China and available from numerous online outlets are almost always equipped with one or another chipset offered by MTK. Such devices rarely come with locked bootloaders, allowing for clean acquisition via the MTK firmware update mode. Note that only devices with unlocked bootloaders can be acquired via this method, so it won't work on bootloader-locked devices produced by, for example, SONY, HTC, or LG.</p>

      <p>Technically, MTK service mode works by installing a virtual serial (COM) port into the system. While dedicated MTK drivers are available, in practice, these are generic Windows drivers for virtual COM ports with a custom <code class="literal">.inf</code> file. Once the driver is installed, an MTK-supplied DLL allows booting into a service bootloader, reading the device info, and extracting the storage content. This method can access both NAND and eMMC memory. New models require updated versions of the MTK service DLL and bootloader. Note that support is added for entire SoC (chipset) families as opposed to individual smartphone models.</p>

      <p>In order to extract a device via MTK physical imaging, select the corresponding option in Oxygen Forensic Suite:</p>

          </div>

        </div>

      </div>

      <p>Physical acquisition options are limited for locked devices featuring the locked bootloader, no root, and disabled ADB Debugging option. A bootloader-level exploit exists for some Qualcomm devices, and can be used by tools such as Cellebrite UFED to boot the device with a patched boot image to allow the tool to extract device image.</p>

      <p>The exploit is based on a critical security vulnerability discovered in certain versions of the kernel bootloader used in Qualcomm reference devices and implemented by multiple OEMs. When processing the boot command in the fastboot mode, the affected kernel bootloader will not verify the unlock status of the device or whether the kernel is properly signed. If the device is using an affected kernel, it can be booted with a patched kernel image without verification.</p>

      <p>Experts can use this vulnerability to boot Android devices with arbitrary kernel images via fastboot even when the target uses a signed kernel and the bootloader is locked. (Source: <span class="emphasis"><em>Fastboot boot command bypasses signature verification (CVE-2014-4325)</em></span> at <a class="ulink" href="https://www.codeaurora.org/projects/security-advisories/fastboot-boot-command-bypasses-signature-verification-cve-2014-4325">https://www.codeaurora.org/projects/security-advisories/fastboot-boot-command-bypasses-signature-verification-cve-2014-4325</a>).</p>

      <p>Bootloader exploits are device-specific and involve using a custom boot image, built specifically for target devices. Manually building a patched boot image for a particular device being investigated is not feasible as it would require a high level of skill and a lot of time. The Cellebrite acquisition kit implements bootloader runtime exploits for multiple devices.</p>

      <p>Bootloader attacks are tethered. They don't write anything into the device while using a patched boot image that only modifies the content of the device volatile memory (RAM) but does not alter the content of the device storage. For this reason, bootloader-level acquisition is forensically sound.</p>

      <p>Since bootloader exploits are device-specific, they are only available for some devices (Cellebrite claims support for most Motorola Android devices, selected Samsung, Qualcomm, and LG GSM and CDMA devices). No universal bootloader exploit exists. Bootloader exploits should be used with caution as some devices are known to wipe data partition when booting into a custom recovery. At the time of writing, bootloader acquisition is exclusive to Cellebrite UFED:</p>

      <p>In addition to bootloader exploits, a few Qualcomm-based devices are susceptible to some of the cleanest acquisition techniques via Qualcomm 9006 mode.</p>

        </div>

        <p>This method is applicable to certain smartphones and tablets based on one of the recent Qualcomm SoC. Bootloader status is irrelevant; devices with locked bootloaders can be successfully imaged with this method. The limiting factors are as follows: the ability to switch the device into Qualcomm Download Mode 9006, and having the correct Qualcomm HS-USB 9006 drivers for a given device.</p>

        <p>This method is considered to be physical acquisition. It returns the full dump of either the entire eMMC storage or just the data partition. The complete raw dump is captured, including unallocated space, which makes it possible to recover the deleted files. This method is clean, safe, forensically sound (it leaves no traces anywhere in the device), and requires no specific technical expertise.</p>

        <p>In this mode, you are capturing the raw image of either the entire eMMC card or selected partitions. If the data partition is encrypted, you will not be prompted for a passcode. The data will be captured encrypted. You may or may not be able to decrypt it afterwards, even if you know the correct passcode. The ability to decrypt encrypted data depends on many factors, such as the version of Android the device is running, the version of Android it was initially released with, and the manufacturer of the device. For example, Samsung used particularly strong versions of custom encryption in some versions of Android. Devices that were initially released with Android 5.x Lollipop use a similarly strong encryption scheme. Devices released with Android 4.2 Jellybean can often be decrypted.</p>

          </div>

        </div>

      </div>

      <p>Qualcomm is known to provide OEMs with a number of reference platforms. Manufacturers can use these platforms, complete with low-level firmware and drivers, to quickly build smartphones and tables without spending much time on research and development.</p>

      <p>Since Qualcomm reference platforms are implemented across a variety of devices made by dozens of different manufacturers, security exploits that are applicable to a certain reference platform can often be applied to other devices built on the same platform. Cellebrite, for one, developed bootloader-level exploits, allowing the company's acquisition tool, UFED, to successfully acquire information from smartphones with locked bootloaders. Importantly, this is applicable to devices across different platforms (Android, Windows Phone 8.x, and Windows 10 Mobile) and regardless of whether or not the device being acquired has its bootloader locked or unlocked.</p>

      <p>Yet another low-level exploit exists, which allows downloading the entire content of the device internal storage (eMMC) by using Qualcomm Download Mode (firmware recovery mode 9006, Qualcomm MMC Storage (Diag 9006), Qualcomm HS-USB Diagnostics 9006, HS-USB QDLoader 9006, Qualcomm HS-USB 9006, or simply qhsusb 9006, depending on the device). This mode is engaged automatically if the device has a corrupt bootloader. On many devices, it can be possible to manually engage this mode by turning the device off and holding the volume down key while connecting it to a PC via a USB port. On some devices, a different sequence is required. For example, LG G Flex 2 requires holding the volume up button while connecting to the PC.</p>

          <p>There is a notable difference between this 9006 diagnostic mode and Qualcomm HS-USB QDLoader 9008 mode. While it is easy to switch the device into the 9008 mode using Qualcomm QPST, additional files are required to boot into the 9006 mode. Imaging the device is not possible from the 9008 mode. More information is available at <a class="ulink" href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/general/help/how-to-enter-qualcomm-mmc-storage-diag-t3253478">http://forum.xda-developers.com/general/help/how-to-enter-qualcomm-mmc-storage-diag-t3253478</a>. Also note that sometimes using QPST's eMMC Software Download Tool can help get the device from 9008 to 9006 by using additional files.</p>

        </div>

      </div>

      <p>By connecting compatible devices in Qualcomm Download Mode 9006 and using specific software, it may be possible to acquire the entire content of the phone's eMMC chip without rooting the device or unlocking its bootloader. Please note that this technique may not work for all manufacturers as some of them (HTC, LG, Motorola, Sony, and so on) may tweak the reference platform to remove user access to the 9006 mode.</p>

      <p>In Qualcomm Download Mode 9006 (provided that the correct drivers are installed and assuming you're using a Windows PC), available partitions may appear in the <span class="strong"><strong>Windows Disk Management</strong></span> console. If this is the case, acquiring the content of the device is as simple as using an imaging tool, such as <span class="strong"><strong>HDD Raw Copy Tool</strong></span> (<a class="ulink" href="http://hddguru.com/software/HDD-Raw-Copy-Tool/">http://hddguru.com/software/HDD-Raw-Copy-Tool/</a>).</p>

      <p>However, Qualcomm-specific software exists, allowing you to identify and acquire individual partitions.</p>

        <p>The tool can read the content of the device's eMMC storage via low-level firmware recovery mode Qualcomm HS-USB 9006. Alternatively, it can mount an Android smartphone as a generic mass storage device.</p>

        <p>eMMC RAW Tool features include the following:</p>

          </div>

        </div>

      </div>

      <p>There is more than one way of using a custom recovery to image an Android device. The first method is the easiest and involves simply booting into a custom recovery (via <code class="literal">fastboot boot twrp.img</code> or <code class="literal">fastboot boot cwm.img</code>) and using on-screen controls to produce a Nandroid backup of the data partition. The second method (via the <code class="literal">dd</code> command) is more complex and requires opening two separate terminal windows; however, this method returns the full raw image of the data partition. The following is a quick comparison of the two methods:</p>

      <div class="itemizedlist">

        <ul class="itemizedlist">

          <li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Nandroid backup</strong></span>: This is quick, easy, and done via graphical user interface (touch-based or controlled with the phone's hardware keys). It only dumps filesystem; no access to unallocated space makes recovering deleted files impossible.</li>

          <li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Imaging via dd</strong></span>: This requires extra tools and two terminal windows. It requires a much higher level of expertise to use and returns the complete raw dump of the data partition with full access to unallocated space, making it possible to recover deleted files.</li>

        </ul>

      </div>

      <p>This book is not about rooting Android or installing custom recoveries. Refer to the end of this book for recommended reading on Android forensics.</p>

      <p>In this chapter, we'll give a brief overview of what a custom recovery can and cannot do for you and what are the limitations and dangers in imaging the device with a custom recovery.</p>

      <div class="note" title="Note" style="">

        <div class="inner">

          <h3 class="title" id="toc_19"><a id="tip16"/>Tip</h3>

          <p> <span class="strong"><strong>Warning</strong></span>: If the device bootloader is locked, unlocking it may (and probably will) cause a full factory reset, which results in complete loss of data. Only proceed if your bootloader is already unlocked or if you know for sure that your device can boot into a custom recovery without wiping data.</p>

        </div>

      </div>

      <p>Using a custom recovery is risky. The Android platform is highly fragmented. Different manufacturers employ different security policies across the many devices they carry within their range. Booting into a custom recovery can succeed, fail, trigger a full factory reset, or succeed and then trigger a full factory reset. Therefore, using a custom recovery, in general, is not considered a forensically sound way of imaging the device.</p>

      <p> <span class="strong"><strong>Encryption</strong></span> </p>

      <p>Custom recoveries may or may not be able to deal with encrypted partitions, even if you know the correct passcode. In addition, if the data partition is captured encrypted, you may or may not be able to decrypt it afterwardsâ€”even if you know the passcode.</p>

      <p>Just a few examples from some recent cases:</p>

          <p> <span class="strong"><strong>Important</strong></span>: Installing or booting into a custom recovery requires the device bootloader to be fully or partially unlocked.

        </div>

      </div>

      <p>Custom recoveries are nothing but bootable, slimmed-down versions of the Linux OS. Custom recoveries are therefore device-specific, as they need to come with the necessary drivers for each particular device model. As such, custom recoveries can seamlessly bypass Android's standard security measures such as access restrictions (but not data encryption).</p>

        <p>Technically, there is nothing preventing custom recoveries from dumping a raw image of the data partition. At this time, neither TWRP nor CWM offer the ability to make raw dumps of the data partition from the user interface (however, boot and system partitions are captured as raw images). As a result, the UI of neither TWRP nor CWM can be used for accessing data stored in unallocated space.</p>

        <p>TWRP can create YAFFS filesystem images. Extracting files from a TWRP Nandroid backup can be performed with one of the many forensic tools available on the market. There is also an open source utility called <span class="strong"><strong>unyaffs</strong></span>. Its source code is available at <a class="ulink" href="https://code.google.com/p/unyaffs/downloads/list">https://code.google.com/p/unyaffs/downloads/list</a>.</p>

        <p>The compiled version of this tool can be used as follows:</p>

        <p>Acquisition via the user interface of most popular custom recoveries (TWRP and CWM) does not allow for imaging the complete data partition in raw mode. In order to be able to investigate unallocated space, you may want to extract the entire user data partition to a raw image.</p>

        <p>In unencrypted Android devices, extracting unallocated areas is only possible by accessing the storage directly. Android built-in security measures prevent such access from within the app framework, making it impossible to scan unallocated areas with any user-level application. Root access is required in order to be able to access storage in low level.</p>

        </div>

        <p>You are now ready to image the device. The following steps describe how to capture an image of the data partition using the <code class="literal">netcat</code> command. You'll be running two different shell sessions at the same time: one to the device and one to your computer.</p>

      </div>

      <div class="section" title="Imaging the device">

          </div>

        </div>

        <p>Run <code class="literal">cmd.exe</code> or use a different terminal (for example, Cygwin). This will be the first shell session that works with the Android device. Run <code class="literal">adb shell</code>. You will receive the root privileges by default, so running <code class="literal">su</code> is not needed.</p>

        <p>Launch another instance of <code class="literal">cmd.exe</code> or your favorite terminal. This session opens as a shell on your computer, and will be used to receive the data from the Android device. Navigate to the folder that will receive the user partition (<code class="literal">cd c:\path</code>). Make sure that you're using an NTFS- or exFAT-formatted hard drive to receive the data; FAT32 volumes will be unable to save images of more than 4 GB, which is less than the typical storage of most phones today. In this shell, run <code class="literal">adb forward tcp:5555 tcp:5555</code> (you may use a different port number if needed). This command enables ADB to communicate via Netcat on port 5555.</p>

        <p>Now, once the connection is established, go back to the first shell that goes to your phone. Type the following command:</p>

        <pre class="programlisting">dd if=/dev/block/mmcblk0 | busybox nc -l -p 5555</pre>

        <p>This command images the contents of <code class="literal">/dev/block/mmcblk0</code> and writes it via port 5555 across ADB using Netcat.</p>

        <p>Alternatively, you may use the following syntax:</p>

        <pre class="programlisting">busybox nc -l -p 5555 -e busybox dd if=/dev/block/mmcblk0p12</pre>

        <p>This command acquires the <code class="literal">mmcblk0p12</code> data block. Note that you will need to figure out the name of the data block on the device being acquired.</p>

        <p>Finally, go back to the second shell (that goes to your computer) and type the following command:</p>

        <pre class="programlisting">nc 127.0.0.1 5555 &gt; image.raw</pre>

        <p>The <code class="literal">nc</code> (Netcat) command saves the output of the first shell to your computer across port 5555. The file will be stored in the same folder where you launched the second shell from. You can change this folder by navigating to the correct place via <code class="literal">cd disk:\path</code>. Note that some Windows folders (for example, <code class="literal">C:\Program Files\</code> and its subfolders) are not write-accessible.</p>

        <p>If all goes well, the window will freeze while it's capturing the image. Once the process is finished, you'll be able to mount the newly captured image in a forensic tool of your choice.</p>

      <p>This acquisition method is applicable to smartphones and tablets that are either rooted or have a custom recovery installed. It is also applicable to devices with fully or partially unlocked bootloaders (allowing the expert to boot the device into a custom recovery).</p>

      <p>If a custom recovery is installed, or can be booted into, a different acquisition method (via the <code class="literal">dd</code> command) is available, allowing to capture the complete raw image of the data partition (refer to the <span class="emphasis"><em>Imaging via custom recovery â€“ physical imaging via dd</em></span> section for more information). The <code class="literal">dd</code> method returns a full dump of either the entire eMMC storage or just the data partition. A Nandroid backup contains the full filesystem of the data partition; unallocated space is not included, which makes recovering deleted files impossible. This method is relatively easy to use, but requires some technical expertise. Nandroid backups are <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> considered a forensically sound acquisition method; however, a Nandroid backup will still contain significantly more information than available via ADB.</p>

      <p>Unlike pretty much every other smartphone OS, Android does not come with the ability to produce full backups of the device. The platform provides no stock tools for making or restoring such backups. Moreover, the platform in its stock state does not even allow third-party developers to make such backup tools as their use would require an elevated level of privileges (<span class="emphasis"><em>root</em></span> rights).</p>

      <p>Individual manufacturers implement proprietary tools for making and restoring backups (for example, Sony PC Companion for Xperia phones and tablets). However, these tools are used by relatively few smartphone owners as (again, unlike iOS) they aren't required to perform other routine tasks such as transferring files to and from the device.</p>

      <p>The need for creating and restoring full filesystem backups is there, especially among the more active Android users who like to experiment with their devices and want to be able to restore their device to its previous working state, should something go wrong. Full filesystem backup tools are available for these users, but only work on rooted devices, devices with custom recoveries, or devices that can be flashed via fastboot.</p>

      <p>Examiners analyzing certain Android devices have yet another venue for extracting the full image of the filesystem (but generally <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> a raw dump of the data partition) by generating a NANDroid backup. NANDroid backups contain the full image of the filesystem for all partitions selected at the time of making the backup. Nandroid backups can be produced by booting the device into a custom recovery, such as CWM or TWRP (by either issuing an ADB command or, if <span class="strong"><strong>USB debugging</strong></span> is not enabled, by holding the volume down and power keys on the device) and selecting the corresponding menu item from the menu.</p>

        <p>While most sources say that you need either root privileges or unlocked bootloader (or both) in order to make Nandroid backups, this is not completely true. Technically speaking, all you need to make a Nandroid backup is a custom recovery, such as CWM or TWRP. Granted, many devices require root access for the user to install custom recovery, and the bootloader must be unlocked in order to be able to install the custom recovery. However, the user may safely relock bootloader after installing custom recovery, which will not affect the ability to produce Nandroid backups. In addition, many devices can safely boot into a custom recovery (via <code class="literal">fastboot boot recovery.img</code>) as opposed to permanently installing one, even if the bootloader is officially locked. For the purpose of mobile forensics, booting into a custom recovery is a much cleaner and more forensically sound method of imaging the device.</p>

        <p>Contrary to popular belief, root access is not an absolute requirement for making Nandroid backups. In order to produce a Nandroid backup, you can either boot into a custom recovery (root status is irrelevant) or use an app (root privileges and BusyBox package required).</p>

        <p>The following two ways are available for making Nandroid backups:</p>

        <div class="itemizedlist">

          <ul class="itemizedlist">

            <li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Unlocked or partially unlocked bootloader, custom recovery (for example, CWM or TWRP) specific to the device available: note that unlocked bootloader is normally required in order to install custom recovery. In addition to this, some devices must be rooted in order to install custom recovery. Unlocking bootloader during the investigation is not normally possible as this operation initiates a full wipe of the data partition. However, bootloader may be relocked after having the custom recovery installed, so technically speaking, unlocked bootloader is not required for making Nandroid backups via custom recovery. For the purpose of making Nandroid backups through custom recovery, root status of the device is irrelevant.</li>

            <li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Rooted device, BusyBox installed, a Nandroid backup app is used: You may be able to make a Nandroid backup even if the bootloader is unlocked. For this, you will be using one of the many Nandroid backup apps. You can sideload an app like that onto the phone. Note that you may need to have BusyBox installed (unless the tool uses its own mechanism for imaging the data partition). Root is required to use such apps; however, root is not required if the operation is performed through a custom recovery.</li>

          </ul>

        </div>

        <p>Having a custom recovery, which is basically a standalone version of the OS, helps tremendously in bypassing most security restrictions (except encryption). If you can boot into a custom recovery (or if you can manage to install it without wiping the device), you can easily dump the entire content of the eMMC storage, or just image the data partition onto an external SD card or OTG flash drive (if either device is supported by the phone).</p>

        <p>In some situations, you may encounter relocked bootloaders (the user unlocks the bootloader, installs a custom recovery, and then relocks the bootloader). While this, in general, is not an issue, some users may protect access to custom recovery with a password. A combination of a locked bootloader and a password-protected custom recovery is extremely tough to break.</p>

    <p>Live imaging may be your last resort when acquiring an encrypted device. Since neither bootloader exploits nor custom recoveries can decrypt encrypted partitions, you may need to start and unlock the device with the correct PIN code in order to gain access to the encrypted data partition.</p>

    <p>Live imaging of an Android device is similar to the process described in the <span class="emphasis"><em>Imaging via custom recovery â€“ physical imaging via dd</em></span> section.</p>

    <div class="section" title="Live imaging with root (via dd)">

          </div>

        </div>

      </div>

      <p>Live imaging is considered to be a less forensically-sound method compared to using a custom recovery or other acquisition methods. This method requires a rooted device with BusyBox installed. Rooting an Android device in general is not always safe or possible. Depending on the version of Android and the method used to obtain root access, rooting may modify the device boot image and/or its system and data partitions. Installing BusyBox may or may not modify the system partition. Rooting and installing BusyBox may also alter the content of the user's data partition. With the recent development of <span class="emphasis"><em>systemless root</em></span>, it is now technically possible to achieve root access and install BusyBox without modifying the system partition.</p>

      <p>Instructions on how to root and install BusyBox on Android devices are widely available, so we won't cover them here.</p>

      <p>Prerequisites are as follows:</p>

        </ol>

      </div>

      <p>If all goes well, you are ready to image the device.</p>

      <p>Launch another instance of <code class="literal">cmd.exe</code> or your favorite terminal. This session opens as a shell to your computer, and will be used to receive the data from the Android device. Navigate to the folder that will receive the user partition (<code class="literal">cd c:\path</code>). Make sure that you're using an NTFS- or exFAT-formatted hard drive to receive the data; FAT32 volumes will be unable to save images of more than 4 GB, which is less than the typical storage of most today's phones. In this shell, run <code class="literal">adb forward tcp:5555 tcp:5555</code> (you may use a different port number if needed). This command enables ADB to communicate via Netcat on port 5555.</p>

      <p>Now, once the connection is established, go back to the first shell that goes to your phone. Type the following command:</p>

      <pre class="programlisting">dd if=/dev/block/mmcblk0 | busybox nc -l -p 5555</pre>

      <p>This command images the contents of /dev/block/mmcblk0 and writes it via port 555 across ADB using Netcat.</p>

      <p>Alternatively, you may use the following syntax:</p>

      <pre class="programlisting">busybox nc -l -p 5555 -e busybox dd if=/dev/block/mmcblk0p12</pre>

      <p>This command acquires the <code class="literal">mmcblk0p12</code> data block. Note that you will need to figure out the name of the data block on the device being acquired.</p>

      <p>Finally, go back to the second shell (that goes to your computer) and type the following command:</p>

      <pre class="programlisting">nc 127.0.0.1 5555 &gt; image.raw</pre>

      <p>The <code class="literal">nc</code> (Netcat) command saves the output of the first shell to your computer across port 5555. The file will be stored in the same folder where you launched the second shell from. You can change this folder by navigating to the correct place via <code class="literal">cd disk:\path</code>. Note that some Windows folders (for example, <code class="literal">C:\Program Files\</code> and its subfolders) are not write-accessible.</p>

      <p>If all goes well, the window will freeze while it's capturing the image. Once the process is finished, you'll be able to mount the newly captured image in a forensic tool of your choice.</p>

        </div>

      </div>

      <p>On some devices, root access may not be available. If this is the case, the only remaining imaging option besides <span class="strong"><strong>Google Account</strong></span> acquisition is attempting to make an ADB backup. This method is 100% logical acquisition; we only discuss this here as it is the last acquisition method available if all other methods fail.</p>

      <p>It is important to realize the limitations of this method. Unlike Apple iOS or BlackBerry 10, a non-rooted backup on Android devices only extracts a very limited amount of information. Application developers may disable backups in their app's Manifest file; ADB will not back up data from these apps. However, if no other acquisition options are available, an ADB backup may still be better than nothing.</p>

      <p>The requirements for this are as follows:</p>

      <div class="itemizedlist">

        <ul class="itemizedlist">

          <li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>USB debugging</strong></span> enabled, or device unlocked/lock screen bypassed in order to enable <span class="strong"><strong>USB debugging</strong></span></li>

          <li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">If data partition is encrypted, the device must be unlocked (bypassing the lock screen is not enough)</li>

          <li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">ADB installed and working</li>

        </ul>

      </div>

      <p>To start imaging the device, turn it on and wait until it is fully booted. Unlock the device (or bypass the screen lock) and make sure that <span class="strong"><strong>USB debugging</strong></span> is enabled in <span class="strong"><strong>Developer options</strong></span>:</p>

      <p> </p>

      <div class="mediaobject">

        <img src="0042.jpeg" alt="Live imaging without root (via ADB backup)"/>

      <div class="mediaobject">

        <img src="0043.jpeg" alt="Live imaging without root (via ADB backup)"/>

      </div>

      <p> </p>

      <p>Next, connect the device to the PC via a USB cable. Launch <code class="literal">cmd.exe</code> in the folder where ADB is installed. Type <code class="literal">adb devices</code> to verify connectivity. On the phone, you should be prompted to authorize debugging from the connected PC; tap to confirm the prompt. If all goes well, you should see the device listed under the <span class="strong"><strong>adb devices</strong></span> prompt:</p>

      <p> </p>

      <div class="mediaobject">

        <img src="0044.jpeg" alt="Live imaging without root (via ADB backup)"/>

      </div>

      <p> </p>

      <p>Next, you'll be using the ADB backup command. The command has the following syntax:</p>

      <pre class="programlisting">adb backup [-f <file>] [-apk|-noapk] [-shared|-noshared] [-all] [-system|nosystem] [<packages...>]</packages...></file></pre>

      <p>If you want to back up the entire content of the device, use the following syntax:</p>

      <pre class="programlisting">adb backup -all -f c:\android\backup.ab</pre>

      <p>On the Android device being imaged, you will see the following prompt:</p>

      <p> </p>

      <div class="mediaobject">

        <img src="0045.jpeg" alt="Live imaging without root (via ADB backup)"/>

      </div>

      <p> </p>

      <p>Tap <span class="strong"><strong>Back up my data</strong></span> and wait till the process completes.</p>

      <div class="note" title="Note" style="">

        <div class="inner">

          <h3 class="title" id="toc_4"><a id="note24"/>Note</h3>

          <p> <span class="strong"><strong>Note</strong></span>: On some devices, ADB backup may not work if the data partition is encryptedâ€”even if you unlock the device with the correct passcode. Currently, there is no known workaround.</p>

        </div>

      </div>

      <p>You can also use Oxygen Forensic Extractor to automatically produce an ADB backup:</p>

      <p> </p>

      <div class="mediaobject">

        <img src="0046.jpeg" alt="Live imaging without root (via ADB backup)"/>

      </div>

      <p> </p>

      <p>The resulting <code class="literal">backup.ab</code> file may be opened in one of the many mobile forensic suites on the market. For example, in Oxygen Forensic Suite, use the following sequence to import this backup: <span class="strong"><strong>Import File</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Import Android backup/image</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Import Android backup...</strong></span> </p>

      <p> </p>

      </div>

      <p> </p>

      <p>After the import completes, you will see something similar to the following screenshot:</p>

      <p>Oxygen Forensic Suite comes with the ability to live-image many types of Android devices. Its acquisition methods range from manufacturer-specific raw dumps to the physical acquisition of rooted devices and the logical acquisition of Android devices that have no root access available. For many models, Oxygen Forensic Suite can bypass bootloader lock and screen lock completely. For certain devices, the tool can automatically acquire root access.</p>

      <p>For live imaging Android devices, you'll be using Oxygen Forensic Extractor:</p>

      <p> </p>

      <div class="mediaobject">

        <img src="0049.jpeg" alt="Live imaging using Oxygen Forensic Suite"/>

      </div>

      <p> </p>

      <p>Connect the device via a USB cable. Unlock and ensure that <span class="strong"><strong>ADB Debugging</strong></span> is enabled:</p>

      <p> </p>

      <div class="mediaobject">

        <img src="0050.jpeg" alt="Live imaging using Oxygen Forensic Suite"/>

      </div>

      <p> </p>

      <p>If it is not, enable <span class="strong"><strong>USB debugging</strong></span> in the device's <span class="strong"><strong>Developer options</strong></span>:</p>

      <p> </p>

      <div class="mediaobject">

        <img src="0051.jpeg" alt="Live imaging using Oxygen Forensic Suite"/>

      </div>

      <p> </p>

      <p>Make sure to authorize <span class="strong"><strong>USB debugging</strong></span> on the device's screen once it's connected to your computer.</p>

      <p>If everything goes well, you will see the following screen:</p>

      <p> </p>

      <div class="mediaobject">

        <img src="0052.jpeg" alt="Live imaging using Oxygen Forensic Suite"/>

      </div>

        <img src="0053.jpeg" alt="Live imaging using Oxygen Forensic Suite"/>

      </div>

      <p> </p>

      <p>If that's the case, check whether USB connectivity is set to something other than <span class="strong"><strong>Charging</strong></span> by pulling the notification panel from the top of the screen. We recommend that you choose the <span class="strong"><strong>Photo transfer (PTP)</strong></span> option:</p>

      <p> </p>

      <div class="mediaobject">

        <img src="0054.jpeg" alt="Live imaging using Oxygen Forensic Suite"/>

      </div>

      <p> </p>

      <p>Click on <span class="strong"><strong>Reconnect</strong></span> in Oxygen Forensic Extractor to make another attempt.</p>

      <p>After connecting the device, Oxygen Forensic Extractor will probe it for root access. If the Android device is already rooted, the device will prompt you to allow root access. Confirm the prompt:</p>

      <p> </p>

      <div class="mediaobject">

        <img src="0055.jpeg" alt="Live imaging using Oxygen Forensic Suite"/>

      </div>

      <p> </p>

      <p>If root was not available on the Android device, Oxygen Forensic Extractor will attempt a range of different exploits to obtain root access:</p>

      <p> </p>

      <div class="mediaobject">

        <img src="0056.jpeg" alt="Live imaging using Oxygen Forensic Suite"/>

      </div>

      <p> </p>

      <p>If root access is successfully obtained, the imaging process will begin automatically:</p>

      <div class="mediaobject">

        <img src="0057.jpeg" alt="Live imaging using Oxygen Forensic Suite"/>

      </div>

      <p> </p>

      <p>If Oxygen Forensic Extractor is unable to obtain root access, physical extraction will fail. You can attempt a different extraction method, such as over-the-air (refer to the <span class="emphasis"><em>Google Account acquisition â€“ over-the-air</em></span> section for more information) or via ADB backup (refer to the <span class="emphasis"><em>Live imaging without root (via ADB backup)</em></span> section for more information):</p>

    <p>Android is a Google OS. Relying heavily on cloud services, most of which are provided by Google, Android devices inevitably leave traces on Google's servers. Extracting information from Google's servers is a great way to complement information available in the device itself. While over-the-air acquisition can be used when all other acquisition methods fail, it is not limited to acquiring Android devices. Instead, acquisition of Google Accounts can provide a much deeper insight into user activities than what's available in a single Android smartphone.</p>

    <p>Note that not all Android devices come with Google Mobile Services; we'll discuss this in detail later on. In particular, Amazon devices (Fire tablets and Amazon Fire Phone) do not come with any Google services preinstalled. However, end users may add Google services later on.</p>

      </div>

      <p>Android backups are limited at best. In the world of Android, cloud backups are still new and (as of Android 6.0) incomplete. However, a lot of interesting data can be obtained directly from the user's Google Account as opposed to Android backups.</p>

      <p>Google is known to collect massive amounts of information about everyone who has a Google Account. If you are able to log in with the user's Google credentials, you will be able to acquire that data regardless of whether you have the actual Android device available. Knowing what Google knows about the suspect can be essential for an investigation.</p>

      <p>Google offers the ability to extract some of this data via its own service, called Google Takeout. Unfortunately, Google Takeout lacks transparency and does not offer full access to available information. The data is stored in a number of different formats, and Google is known for declining requests to help investigators analyze the data.</p>

      <p>Google provides a diverse range of services, most of which are free of charge. The company offers Google Mail (Gmail), Google Drive, the ubiquitous Google Search, Google Chrome (with cloud sync), Google Maps, and dozens of other services that automatically sync across devices with the help of a single Google Account.</p>

      <p>Google Account is a single-stop aggregation of information about the user's online behavior and offline activities. Google analyzes search queries and communications, and recommends places to visit and things to read. Google collects and maintains a comprehensive location history; stores all Google searches performed on registered desktop and mobile devices; syncs Chrome tabs, bookmarks, passwords, and history; keeps notes; annotates pictures; syncs contacts; and does a lot more.</p>

      <p>All this data is collected by different services and is stored in different places across Google servers. The data is available in a range of different formats, and requires using vastly different protocols to access. However, the entirety of this data is accessible with a single authentication via Google Account.</p>

      <p>What can you expect when extracting data from a Google Account? Nearly everyone has a Gmail account, which means messages and contacts. Google Chrome accounts for nearly half of all Web requests, which means tabs, bookmarks, and search history, as well as Web forms and logins. Google Maps is a major player, and Google Drive offers cloud storage for pretty much everything. Here's what you can expect to see when acquiring data from a Google Account:</p>

      <p>Cloud backups are new to Android. Automatic backup of third-party application data was only made available in Android 6.0. However, even in earlier versions of Android, some bits of data were still exported into the cloud and restored when the user initialized a new device with their Google credentials. Particularly, we've seen the following data:</p>

      <div class="itemizedlist">

        <ul class="itemizedlist">

        </ul>

      </div>

      <p>Android 6.0 introduced support for cloud backups, allowing third-party apps to have automatic backup and restore:</p>

      <p> </p>

      <div class="mediaobject">

        <img src="0059.jpeg" alt="A word on Android backups"/>

      </div>

      <p> </p>

      <p>However, Android cloud backups are still severely limited compared to iOS and Windows Phone counterparts. While prerelease versions of Android 6.0 allowed third-party apps to <span class="emphasis"><em>opt-out</em></span> from data backups (the default behavior was <span class="emphasis"><em>backups enabled for all apps that did not opt out via manifest</em></span>), the release version of Android 6.0 did not retain this change.</p>

      <p>The final version of Android 6.0 uses the <span class="emphasis"><em>opt-in</em></span> method, allowing application developers to explicitly allow backups for their apps through the manifest file. The default behavior is <span class="emphasis"><em>no data backups</em></span>. As of today, very few apps have made use of this feature. This includes Google's own apps, which don't use the new backup feature of Android 6.0. Instead, they use Google Drive to back up their data.</p>

          <p> <span class="strong"><strong>Note</strong></span>: At this time, WhatsApp messenger does not use the default backup mechanism provided by Android 6.0. Instead, WhatsApp offers the ability to back up its content directly to Google Drive. WhatsApp backups can be acquired from Google Drive; however, in order to decrypt the backup, one will need to extract the decryption key, which is only accessible if the device is rooted. Oxygen Forensic Suite can accomplish this goal.</p>

      <p>Pictures available in the user's Google Photos space are also stored in the cloud. The Google Photos service contains much more information compared to Google Drive:</p>

      </div>

      <p>Certain bits of data (for example, location history, dashboard items, and Hangout conversations) can be acquired without making Google alert the user by e-mail.</p>

          </div>

      </div>

      <p>When acquiring information from Google, the first and obvious choice is using Google's own data exporting service, Google Takeout. This service is available at <a class="ulink" href="https://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout">https://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout</a>.</p>

      <p>Google Takeout allows users to download their data. However, Takeout is not a good forensic solution for several reasons. Takeout uses a plethora of formats such as OPML (RSS), CSV, plain text, JSON (GeoJSON for map data), vCard, PDF, and HTML, as well as several others:</p>

      <p> </p>

      <div class="mediaobject">

        <img src="0060.jpeg" alt="Google Takeout"/>

      </div>

      <p> </p>

      <p>While Google Takeout exports a lot of data, it fails to provide some important bits. Google Takeout leaves traces in the user's account and notifies the user via an e-mail alert that their data was accessed. The resulting file produced by Google Takeout is not immediately usable, as the data is stored in numerous formats and cannot be used for searching and analyzing as-is.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="section" title="Google Account acquisition and analysis using Elcomsoft Cloud Explorer">

      <div class="titlepage">

            <h2 class="title" id="toc_6"><a id="ch04lvl2sec40"/>Google Account acquisition and analysis using Elcomsoft Cloud Explorer</h2>

          </div>

        </div>

      </div>

      <p>Google Takeout does not provide full access to some bits of data, which includes stored passwords, search queries on connected devices, Chrome page transitions, and the browsing history. This data remains available elsewhere in Google and can be extracted manually. However, manual extraction can be labor-intensive and time-consuming.</p>

      <p>In order to automate the extraction, you can use Elcomsoft Cloud Explorer. The tool authenticates into the Google Account and automatically downloads all available information from Google servers. The built-in viewer displays information in human-readable form and enables fast searching and filtering. Elcomsoft Cloud Explorer attempts to minimize the traces it leaves in the account being acquired. In particular, it does not cause an e-mail alert during the acquisition. As an example, the tool can display links the user clicked on after firing up a search:</p>

      <p> </p>

      <div class="mediaobject">

        <img src="0061.jpeg" alt="Google Account acquisition and analysis using Elcomsoft Cloud Explorer"/>

      </div>

      <p> </p>

      <p>Elcomsoft Cloud Explorer offers investigators access to Google Accounts and allows downloading all available information. The tool leaves fewer traces compared to Google Takeout while pulling more data than the Google's service:</p>

      <p> </p>

      <div class="mediaobject">

        <img src="0062.jpeg" alt="Google Account acquisition and analysis using Elcomsoft Cloud Explorer"/>

      </div>

      <p> </p>

      <p>Note that Google may alert the user once someone accesses the user's Google Account from a different device or IP address. While using Google Takeout is a certain way to trigger such an alert, using Elcomsoft Cloud Explorer reduces (but does not completely eliminate) such probability. At this time, we don't know what types of data might trigger such alerts. Just be aware of the possibility.</p>

      <p>You can extract the following:</p>

      <div class="itemizedlist">

        <ul class="itemizedlist">

          <li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">User profile</li>

          <p>Chrome synced data may be protected with an additional password. Elcomsoft Cloud Explorer can decrypt the data if you enter the correct password.</p>

          </div>

        </div>

      </div>

      <p>Some Google accounts may be protected with two-factor authentication, requiring experts to provide an extra code in addition to the user's Google ID and password. If you are using Google Takeout or Elcomsoft Cloud Explorer, you will be prompted to enter the additional six-digit code if two-factor authentication is enabled on a given account.</p>

        </div>

      </div>

      <p>It is essential to realize that Google alerts users on Takeout acquisition by sending them an e-mail to their registered address. This only happens when Google Takeout is used. If you use Elcomsoft Cloud Explorer, you will not trigger an alert and will leave traces in the user's Google Account (this may change in the future, but currently this is the case). Note that, in some rare cases, accessing certain types of data may still trigger a notification from Google. At this time, we don't know what exactly triggers this notification. Consider this being the risk associated with cloud acquisition.</p>

          </div>

        </div>

      </div>

      <p>When using Google Takeout, prepare to face many cumbersome data formats. On the other hand, Elcomsoft Cloud Explorer automatically decodes these data formats. The tool displays the data in human-readable form, allowing viewing and analyzing information obtained from the suspect's Google Account:</p>

      <p> </p>

      <p>The built-in viewer recognizes data formats used by Google and is available in the Google Account. The data is parsed and displayed automatically. The viewer offers instant filtering and quick search. Locating contacts, messages, or authentication credentials (login and password) requires typing a part of the word you are looking for into the search box.</p>

    <p>In this chapter, we reviewed the tools, methods, and practical steps to perform the acquisition of various Android devices. We covered low-level acquisition techniques via device service modes, and talked about physical acquisition via root exploits and bootloader-level exploits. We also covered logical acquisition and discussed its limitations on the Android platform. In the next chapter, we'll move over to the other mobile platform, and learn about acquisition techniques applicable to Apple iOS.</p>
