    the mobile devices market. The variety of the operating system versions and the
    hardware platforms on which they are used provide a wide range of data extraction
    methods. There is no such range of data extraction methods for any group of the
    following mobile devices: iOS devices, Windows Phone devices, and BlackBerry devices.'

- en: '**Logical extraction**:This method allows to extract only certain types of
    logical data, such as Phonebook, Calls, Messages (SMS/MMS), and so on. As a rule,
    logical extraction requires the installation of an agent program that helps the
    mobile forensic software to extract data from a device. The installation of the
    program on the device is required by the hardware features of the memory structure
    and security policy of mobile devices.'

- en: '**Backup**: This method allows to extract only logical data from a device,
    such as Phonebook, Calls, Messages (SMS/MMS), video files, images, audio files,
    and so on. The information from applications (for example, from IM messengers)
    is transferred fully or partially into the created backup. It (whether the application
    data will be transferred or not) depends on the version of the operating system
    and the security settings of a mobile device. Often, there are situations where
    only the account information is transferred to the created backup from the installed
    application and it makes an expert think that the forensic software he uses does
    not support data extraction from this application, but if the expert extracts
    the file system or physical dump of the device instead of creating the backup,
    his forensic software will extract the application data (for example, chats).'

- en: The program Oxygen Forensic has been already described previously in Chapter
    1\. In this chapter, the physical dump of a device via Oxygen Forensic will be
    shown. In order to make a physical dump, you need to have superuser’s permissions.
    You need to gain root access to the device in order to get superuser’s permissions.
    There are many ways to gain the root access at the Android device, [the description
    of which is beyond the scope of this book](https://forum.xda-developers.com).
    A special feature of Oxygen Forensic is that before the physical dump is made,
    the program tries to gain the root access automatically by means of consistent
    usage of different types of exploits. This function does not lead to any damage
    of the device. On one hand, this function is a great virtue, but on the other
    hand, it can be used only for a limited range of devices. On the internet, many
    methods of gaining root access for a great number of devices are described, but
    there is a possibility that applying these methods can lead to the damage of the
    device beyond recovery even before the data extraction.

    protocol, in the Firmware Update mode. Initially, the LAF technology was developed
    for LG service centers. It allowed to recover LG mobile devices, which do not
    turn on and do not react to attempts to turn them on (mobile devices drop into
    this state when users try to gain more privileges in their operating system or
    in case of errors in updating the system software produced by unqualified users).
    However, there are a lot of utilities exploiting this technology in non-specialized
    service centers; these utilities are used for flashing the custom recovery of
    modified firmware of LG mobile devices.

- en: Unfortunately, there is no forensic program that would support data extraction
    from Smart Switch backups. Also, part of the information in these backups is encrypted.
    This is why you cannot view the extracted data manually. In order to extract data
    from these backups, you need to upload data to the transfer phone. Transfer phone
    is a rooted Samsung phone after hard reset. After uploading data from the Smart
    Switch backup into it, the data can be extracted via any forensic program and
    by any method described in the Chapter.
