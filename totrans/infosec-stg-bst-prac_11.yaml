    to unforeseen levels of efficiency, helping to automate previously manual and
    menial tasks. By looking at your organization's software assets (and updating
    your risk register as you do it), you have become more and more aware that nearly
    every business process is aided by at least one software solution, and that the
    more resilient, secure, and available the software is, the more benefit is seen
    by the organization.

    has been purchased or licensed from third parties. These systems often present
    huge attack surfaces, with many moving parts that are ready to be exploited, and
    since they process confidential and sensitive information and store business-critical
    data, unauthorized access to (or destruction of) these systems can lead to either
    permanent loss of critical data or the loss of confidentiality or integrity of
    intellectual property, company secrets, and customer data. Furthermore, these
    breaches can lead to colossal fines from regulators, adding insult to injury.

    to ensure your organization mitigates the risk presented by the software it uses.

    the risk profile for software systems developed by a vendor, how to reduce the
    likelihood of vulnerabilities and errors in your organization's in-house development
    activities, and methods to mitigate against security risks, focusing on the CIA

    April 2014, an important moment in the general history of InfoSec; the world was
    blindsided by the disclosure of the *CVE-2014-0160* vulnerability, given the moniker
    of **Heartbleed**. Now, when I use the term *the world*, I mean it. *Heartbleed*
    was the *Jaws* of software security blockbusters, getting a website of its own

    contained a vulnerability related to a **buffer over-read**, allowing a malicious
    actor to access cryptographic keys and login credentials, along with various other
    pieces of confidential information. It sounds bad, but it gets worse: the OpenSSL
    cryptography library is used in the **OpenSSL version of the TLS protocol**, widely
    used globally for securing data in transit, pretty much everywhere. To put it
    plainly: over half of the top 1 million most-popular **TLS-/HTTPS-protected sites**
    were affected and able to be exploited.'

    it didn't prevent devices such as firewalls, Android phones, and other trusted
    hardware, as well as software and websites, from being left vulnerable until the
    patches were implemented and updates were rolled out to align with the most recent
    version.

    2011; we know this because it was viewable to anybody who cared to look through
    and read the source code. This was as a result of the fact that OpenSSL was software
    created in an **open source** development context. Open source means that the
    source code of the software is freely available to be read, modified, and redistributed.
    A perceived advantage of the *open source software movement* is the idea that
    transparent software prevents security-through-obscurity among other vulnerabilities
    in the source code, as it would be discovered by anybody who cares to look. Unfortunately,
    in the case of OpenSSL''s cryptography library, it seems as though either nobody
    noticed or nobody was willing to shout about the vulnerability until 3 years later.'

    Security has been an afterthought to any organization looking to create new features
    and roll out new products, but as time has gone on, with blockbuster-style disclosures
    such as Heartbleed entering into the lexicon of the average business owner and
    IT professional, we've seen a paradigm shift toward giving security a bit more
    consideration.

    regardless of whether it's a vendor-created productivity suite, an open source
    cryptography library, or a tool developed by an in-house team for your employees?
    You're not going to catch every issue, so it's important to manage your expectations
    on the matter. Just like with anything in information security, it's about risk
    management and setting up the appropriate policies and procedures to ensure the
    necessary steps have been taken, in line with the value of the assets in question.

    based on the level of loss your organization faces from fines and reputational

    Excel spreadsheets with rows and rows of hundreds of questions, along with drop-down
    or free-text cells to input answers, and/or evidence and justifications for answering
    the way they did. If you've ever worked as a security professional at an organization
    that develops software to be offered to customers, you've had to fill these assessment
    spreadsheets out, and they're never the same, unfortunately. Google tried their
    best to standardize these questions into an open source, interactive, and dynamic

    risk is above the acceptable level, we need to make the decision to either mitigate
    it, accept it, or avoid it. I should hope, considering we're nearly at the end

    all potential vendors will become costly for your organization very quickly. A
    novel solution for both vendors and customers that has recently become popular
    is the implementation of a bug bounty program, where a software vendor opens their
    product up to be penetration tested by bug bounty hunters, who are trying to exploit
    security vulnerabilities for a reward offered by the vendor. Companies such as
    Bugcrowd (https://www.bugcrowd.com/) and HackerOne (https://www.hackerone.com/)
    are offering organizations such as yours (and your vendors) the opportunity to
    have their software "hacked" by security professionals globally. If your vendor
    has a bug bounty program, it may bode well for where they stand in their security
    posture, especially if you are able to review the bugs that have been found and
    the current open bounties.

    for the secure SDLC. These policies, procedures, and tools are able to ensure
    the efficient and secure development of high-quality software by your teams. You
    can design the SDLC to reflect your organization's *risk tolerance* and the idiosyncrasies
    of your existing processes, but staying in line with the general ideologies will
    help you in your quest.

    covered earlier in this chapter, so instead, I would like to go into how we might
    implement practical controls to achieve the high-level goals we've previously
    covered.

    our requirements for the SDLC are met. For example, **issue trackers** allow a
    transparent discussion between developers, product team members, and other stakeholders
    on software bugs, feature requests, vulnerability discoveries, and so on. These
    issue trackers allow teams to estimate requirements, assign priorities, and give
    complexity scores to each issue, to help organize how they might be handled.

    develop and make changes to software in a development context, without affecting
    the main branch, which is used for production, or even potentially a development
    branch for the current sprint. You want to protect this branch from change without
    various forms of sign-off, which you can arrange to include code reviews, testing,
    and ensuring the merge is following the separation-of-duties and two-man principles.

    engineer, allowing transparent audit processes and clear documentation of all
    approvals. All commits can be signed using public-key cryptography, providing
    non-repudiation and integrity for each engineer's incremental contribution to
    the codebase.

    for your organization's servers and tools in repositories and apply the same level
    of scrutiny as you would over the software that is being developed.

    developed by third parties, especially when the processes under which they are
    developed are opaque, such as when we procure software from a vendor that doesn't
    disclose their approach when it comes to security. We delved into how we might
    better understand the risk presented by third-party software, either as proprietary
    solutions or in the context of the open source model.

    better software in-house, with testing and automation at the heart of the solution
    to ensure scalability and efficiency in finding vulnerabilities, which could lead
    to a loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability.

    establishing your requirements, policies, and procedures surrounding software
    development and use in your organization. With this knowledge, you're able to
    accurately measure the risk presented and respond to any residual risk that is
    deemed to be above the acceptable risk tolerance.
