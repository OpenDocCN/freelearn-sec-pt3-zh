    <h1 id="_idParaDest-190" class="chapterTitle">Internet Artifacts</h1>
    <p class="normal">The internet has become a staple in commercial and consumer environments. Digital communication between users is a daily activity. It is uncommon for a household not to have a device connected to the internet in some manner. They give students in elementary school devices to connect to the internet to enhance their education. Email addresses, URLs, social media, and file sharing are all vectors of activities a user can partake in. It is up to the user to decide whether their online activities will meet social norms and be accepted or whether they will cross the line and conduct criminal activity. Your job as a digital forensic investigator will be to investigate their activities in the digital realm. </p>
    <p class="normal">In this chapter, we will be discussing some of the common browsers and social media sites and the artifacts they provide. We will also discuss P2P file-sharing tools, cloud computing services, and their artifacts.</p>
    <p class="normal">We’ll be covering them in the following topics:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList">Understanding browsers </li>
      <li class="bulletList">Social media</li>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Peer-to-Peer </strong>(<strong class="keyWord">P2P</strong>) file sharing</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Cloud computing</li>
    </ul>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-191" class="heading-1">Understanding browsers</h1>
    <p class="normal">What is a<a id="_idIndexMarker783"/> browser? A user can use a program or an application to access websites <a id="_idIndexMarker784"/>via the <strong class="keyWord">World Wide Web</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">WWW</strong>). The best browser is an ongoing debate and can be a very personal choice for a user. The user has options to personalize the browser to enhance their experience when accessing the WWW. </p>
    <p class="normal">As a result, this creates many artifacts that any digital forensic investigator can use to recreate the user’s activity. In addition, there will be logs, history files, and cache files that a digital forensic investigator can examine to identify unethical or criminal activity.</p>
    <p class="normal">Like all technology, browsers <a id="_idIndexMarker785"/>are continuously being updated and changed. User experience is typically the key to these changes, but security has also been a driving factor lately. While the security enhancements are not specifically designed to frustrate or hamper digital forensic investigations, they do have that effect.</p>
    <p class="normal">We will now discuss some common browsers you may encounter during your investigations. This is not an all-inclusive list, and there will be browsers that you may encounter that we will not discuss.</p>
    <p class="normal">As of July 2019, according to W3Counter, the Chrome browser has a 55 percent market share, followed by Safari at 12 percent, Internet Explorer/Edge at 8 percent, and Firefox at 6 percent. Chrome is the leader in the browser wars, and you can find the Chrome browser in many operating systems. We will now discuss the Chrome browser and the artifacts you may run into during your investigations.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-192" class="heading-2">Exploring Google Chrome</h2>
    <p class="normal">Google Chrome <a id="_idIndexMarker786"/>was released in 2008 and was very popular with users. It provided a fast <a id="_idIndexMarker787"/>and efficient user experience and experienced very few exploits. Chrome stores much of the data within different databases and provides us with the option of syncing data across multiple platforms. This means you may come across artifacts that have been generated with another device. So, let’s get into the details of the Chrome browser. </p>
    <h3 id="_idParaDest-193" class="heading-3">Understanding bookmarks</h3>
    <p class="normal">The first artifact<a id="_idIndexMarker788"/> we will look at is the user’s bookmarks. The bookmarks<a id="_idIndexMarker789"/> allow the user to save web pages they find interesting and may give insight into the user’s activity. You can find the bookmarks file at the following path:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting con"><code class="hljs-con">%USERS%/AppData/Local/Google/Chrome/User Data/Default/Bookmarks
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">The file will <em class="italic">not</em> have a file extension, and it is a <strong class="keyWord">JSON</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">JavaScript Object Notation</strong>)formatted file. JSON is an open standard file and data interchange format.</p>
    <p class="normal">You can<a id="_idIndexMarker790"/> open the file in any text reader, and it will show you the<a id="_idIndexMarker791"/> contents, as shown in the following screenshot of a JSON BBC bookmark:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B18329_09_01.png" alt="A picture containing text, receipt  Description automatically generated"/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 9.1: JSON BBC bookmark</p>
    <p class="normal">Here, we can see the following fields:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList">Date added </li>
      <li class="bulletList">Last visited desktop</li>
      <li class="bulletList">The name of the bookmark</li>
      <li class="bulletList">The URL</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">But the presentation of information is not very graphical. An alternative method is to use a free text viewer such as <a id="_idIndexMarker792"/>Notepad++ (available at <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/">https://notepad-plus-plus.org/</a>) and the JSON plugin. </p>
    <p class="normal">That will make the folder structure easier to read, as depicted in the following screenshot:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B18329_09_02.png" alt="Graphical user interface, text, application  Description automatically generated"/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 9.2: JSON root folder</p>
    <p class="normal">The <a id="_idIndexMarker793"/>preceding screenshot shows that there are three folders <a id="_idIndexMarker794"/>underneath the root directory: <code class="inlineCode">bookmark_bar</code>, <code class="inlineCode">other</code>, and <code class="inlineCode">synced</code>. When the <code class="inlineCode">bookmark_bar</code> folder is expanded, it reveals the existence of additional <code class="inlineCode">children</code> folders, as depicted in the following screenshot:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B18329_09_03.png" alt="Figure 9.3 – JSON children "/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 9.3: JSON children</p>
    <p class="normal">The <a id="_idIndexMarker795"/>first folders are only labeled with numbers starting<a id="_idIndexMarker796"/> from zero. When we expand the <code class="inlineCode">1</code> folder, the folder’s name is revealed to be <code class="inlineCode">News</code>, along with the date/timestamps or when it was added and modified. When the <code class="inlineCode">children</code> folder is opened, the bookmarks are now available for viewing, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B18329_09_04.png" alt="Figure 9.4 – JSON bookmarks "/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 9.4: JSON bookmarks</p>
    <p class="normal">The date/timestamps are encoded in Google Chrome Value. To decode the date/timestamp, I enjoy using the open-source <a id="_idIndexMarker797"/>tool DCode (which is available at <a href="https://www.digital-detective.net/dcode/">https://www.digital-detective.net/dcode/</a>). DCode can also be used to decipher numerous different types of date/timestamps.</p>
    <p class="normal">As shown in the following screenshot, you can see the tool has translated the Google Chrome Value into a more readable format:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B18329_09_05.png" alt="Figure 9.5 – DCode tool used for translating Google Chrome value  "/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 9.5: DCode tool used for translating the Google Chrome Value </p>
    <p class="normal">The<a id="_idIndexMarker798"/> BBC <a id="_idIndexMarker799"/>News bookmark was added on Saturday, April 16, 2016, at 03:30:21 UTC.</p>
    <p class="normal">The mere presence of an incriminating bookmark may not be enough to act upon. To support the hypothesis, the user visited the web page indicated by the bookmark; you may have to look at additional artifacts. One such artifact is the history file, which we will examine next.</p>
    <h3 id="_idParaDest-194" class="heading-3">Understanding the Chrome history file</h3>
    <p class="normal">The Google <a id="_idIndexMarker800"/>Chrome history file<a id="_idIndexMarker801"/> will be found in the following path:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting con"><code class="hljs-con">%USERS%/AppData/Local/Google/Chrome/User Data/
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">The file will not have a file extension, and it is a SQLite database. Most forensic tools will view the contents of the database. The history database contains quite a lot of information about the user’s activity:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList">Downloads:
    <p class="normal">This will include the path of where the downloaded file was saved, the location the file was downloaded from, the start/stop times of the download, and the size of the file downloaded.</p>
</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList">Keyword search will track the search terms that the user entered using the URL address bar.</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Typed URLs will track the URLs the user typed into the address bar.</li>
      <li class="bulletList">History:</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">This will track the URLs visited by the user, the number of times the URL was visited, and the date/time the URL was visited.</p>
    <p class="normal">As we examine the<a id="_idIndexMarker802"/> history file, the following text depicts the user’s<a id="_idIndexMarker803"/> activity:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B18329_09_06.png" alt="Text  Description automatically generated with medium confidence"/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 9.6: User’s Chrome History</p>
    <p class="normal">The user downloaded a file named <code class="inlineCode">Thunderbird Setup 68.0.exe</code> and saved it in the <code class="inlineCode">Downloads</code> folder of the <code class="inlineCode">IEUser</code>. We also have the start time of 16:14:38 UTC and know that the download was completed at 16:14:40 UTC.</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B18329_09_07.png" alt="A screenshot of a computer  Description automatically generated with medium confidence"/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 9.7: User’s Search History</p>
    <p class="normal">The user also conducted two keyword searches, as follows:</p>
    <p class="normal">The user searched for the terms <code class="inlineCode">Gmail</code> and <code class="inlineCode">Thunderbird</code>. The search engine Google was used for the search, searching for the term <code class="inlineCode">Gmail</code>. The search was conducted on August 28, 2019, and the <code class="inlineCode">Thunderbird</code> search was conducted on August 29, 2019. (I have redacted a portion of the URL(s) to help with formatting.)</p>
    <p class="normal">The <a id="_idIndexMarker804"/>following <a id="_idIndexMarker805"/>is a listing of the websites the user visited:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B18329_09_08.png" alt="Text  Description automatically generated"/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 9.8: User’s Internet History</p>
    <p class="normal">From the history file, we can see that the user searched for the term <strong class="keyWord">Thunderbird</strong> and that seconds later, the user went to the Thunderbird download page. Before the user searched for the<a id="_idIndexMarker806"/> term <strong class="keyWord">Thunderbird</strong>, the user visited two different web-based email accounts. In addition, we can see the user visited Yahoo mail and Gmail the night before. Based on this analysis, we have identified distinct and different email addresses the user may be <a id="_idIndexMarker807"/>using or, at a minimum, has access to. </p>
    <p class="normal">Next, in terms of browser artifacts, are cookies. </p>
    <h3 id="_idParaDest-195" class="heading-3">Cookies</h3>
    <p class="normal">A cookie<a id="_idIndexMarker808"/> is a dataset created by a website and stored on the user’s system. Cookies are designed to track the user’s activity, such as adding an item to a shopping cart or recording the number of pages the user has visited. Be aware that just because a cookie is on the system, it is <a id="_idIndexMarker809"/>not conclusive evidence that<a id="_idIndexMarker810"/> the user knowingly visited the site. You will need to find other artifacts as supporting evidence of the user’s activity.</p>
    <p class="normal">The Google Chrome cookie file can be found at the following path:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting con"><code class="hljs-con">%USERS%/AppData/Local/Google/Chrome/User Data/Default
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">The file will not have a file extension, and it is a SQLite database. Most forensic tools will view the contents of the database. The following screenshot is the output of X-Ways Forensics:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B18329_09_09.png" alt="Figure 9.6 – Cookies "/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 9.9: Cookies</p>
    <p class="normal">While the data is<a id="_idIndexMarker811"/> readable, the format leaves a lot to be desired. A third-party application, Chrome Cookies View (available at <a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/chrome_cookies_view.html">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/chrome_cookies_view.html</a>), will parse the data in a format that is easy to read, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B18329_09_10.png" alt="Figure 9.7 – Cookie View "/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 9.10: Cookie View</p>
    <p class="normal">Now, the columns <a id="_idIndexMarker812"/>and the data are lined up and formatted correctly. The <a id="_idIndexMarker813"/>tool also converts the date/timestamp from Google Chrome time into UTC time. Cookies are one part of tracking a user’s activities, but the cache may also contain artifacts that are useful for your investigation.</p>
    <h3 id="_idParaDest-196" class="heading-3">Cache</h3>
    <p class="normal">We discussed the cache<a id="_idIndexMarker814"/> earlier in <em class="chapterRef">Chapter 8</em>, <em class="italic">Email Forensics – Investigation Techniques</em>, and we still have the same issue in that when we examine the content, it is<a id="_idIndexMarker815"/> difficult to decipher. There is a third-party tool called <a id="_idIndexMarker816"/>Chrome Cache View (available at <a href="https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/chrome_cache_view.html">www.nirsoft.net/utils/chrome_cache_view.html</a>) that converts the data into a readable format. The following screenshot is an example of the output you may see:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B18329_09_11.png" alt="Figure 9.8 – Cache view "/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 9.11: Cache view</p>
    <p class="normal">When you select the items of interest, Chrome Cache View allows you to export the information into a much easier to read format, as follows:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting con"><code class="hljs-con">Filename          : gmail.html 
URL               : https://www.google.com/gmail 
Content Type      : text/html 
File Size         : 0 
Last Accessed     : 8/28/2019 15:17

ETag              : 
Server IP Address : 172.217.14.100 
URL Length        : 28 ==================================================
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">This is much easier to read and understand. You are still being shown the same information, but the presentation is much better.</p>
    <p class="normal">You have the filename and the date/time they visited the web page. Of interest is the server IP address. If you find data within the cache, such as illicit images, this may lead you to the server where <a id="_idIndexMarker817"/>the user <a id="_idIndexMarker818"/>hosted the original images.</p>
    <p class="normal">Now, we will discuss passwords and how they are stored within the Chrome browser.</p>
    <h3 id="_idParaDest-197" class="heading-3">Passwords</h3>
    <p class="normal">Passwords<a id="_idIndexMarker819"/> can be key to unlocking different files or encryptions. Most<a id="_idIndexMarker820"/> users will reuse the same passwords for multiple different accounts. Your ability to recover the user’s previously used passwords can lead to a treasure trove of information. Chrome has the option for a user to save passwords. </p>
    <p class="normal">You will find the password information in the <code class="inlineCode">Logon Data</code> file, which can be found at the following path:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting con"><code class="hljs-con">%USERS%/AppData/Local/Google/Chrome/User Data/Default
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">The file will not have a file extension, and it is a SQLite database. It does not contain the actual password for the user accounts; instead, it stores information about each account, which is used to encrypt <a id="_idIndexMarker821"/>the passwords. There is a third-party utility, Chrome Pass (available at <a href="https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/chromepass.html">https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/chromepass.html</a>), which will decrypt the passwords.</p>
    <p class="normal">The Google Chrome browser is the current number one browser used today. You may encounter multiple browsers on a user’s system. The next browser we will talk about is Internet Explorer, the default browser for the Microsoft Windows operating system.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-198" class="heading-2">Exploring Internet Explorer/Microsoft Edge (Old Version)</h2>
    <p class="normal">Internet Explorer<a id="_idIndexMarker822"/> is the web browser of the Microsoft Windows operating system. Microsoft has included the browser with Windows since 1995. Internet Explorer was the number one browser during the 1990s, but with the release of Firefox in 2004 and Google Chrome in 2008, its popularity has dropped. Internet Explorer is still included with Windows 10 but has been replaced with Microsoft Edge. </p>
    <p class="normal">The following artifacts are for the older version of Microsoft Edge as the current version is based on Chromium. The Chromium version will have artifacts based on Google Chrome. </p>
    <p class="normal">The default location of the artifacts for the Chromium-based Edge browser is:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting con"><code class="hljs-con">C:\Users\%USER%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Edge\User Data\Default
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">You will find artifacts common to Chromium-based browsers, such as bookmarks (JSON file), cache files (Index, Datablock, and Data files), cookies (SQLite database), and history (SQLite Database). So, let’s jump in and look at the artifacts you may recover from the user’s activity in the Internet Explorer Edge (Old Version) browser. </p>
    <h3 id="_idParaDest-199" class="heading-3">Bookmarks</h3>
    <p class="normal">Unlike the Google Chrome browser, Internet Explorer <a id="_idIndexMarker823"/>saves bookmarks<a id="_idIndexMarker824"/> in a URL format. The default path Internet Explorer keeps the bookmarks in is as follows:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting con"><code class="hljs-con">%USER%/Favorites
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">All commercial and open-source forensic tools can read the URL format. The following screenshot depicts the typical data structure you will find:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B18329_09_12.png" alt="Figure 9.9 – IE bookmarks "/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 9.12: IE bookmarks</p>
    <p class="normal">As you examine the bookmarks stored in the <code class="inlineCode">Favorites</code> folder, you can also view the created and modified timestamps. These are the date/timestamps for when the URL file was created/modified.</p>
    <p class="normal">When you examine the URL file, you may find content like the following:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting con"><code class="hljs-con">[DEFAULT]
BASEURL=http://christensminischnauzers.com/
{000214A0-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}
Prop3=19,2 
[InternetShortcut]
URL=http://christensminischnauzers.com/IDList=
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">As you can see, it contains the URL, which is the point of interest if the website is dealing with contraband, or the user’s activity, which supports your hypothesis about the events you are investigating.</p>
    <p class="normal">Next, we’ll check the user’s history and see if we can find any interesting artifacts.</p>
    <h3 id="_idParaDest-200" class="heading-3">IE history</h3>
    <p class="normal">Internet Explorer<a id="_idIndexMarker825"/> will track the user’s activity for 20 days. This is<a id="_idIndexMarker826"/> the default setting and can be changed by the user. As we discussed in <em class="chapterRef">Chapter 6</em>, <em class="italic">Windows Artifact Analysis,</em> Internet Explorer will also track some user activity in the operating system. Internet Explorer is an integral part of the Windows operating system, and even if the user prefers a different browser, there still may be artifacts of interest within the Internet Explorer history.</p>
    <p class="normal">Edge and Internet Explorer version 10 and higher use an ESE database called <code class="inlineCode">WebCacheV01.dat</code> that can be found at the following path:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting con"><code class="hljs-con">%User%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\WebCache
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">To analyze the <code class="inlineCode">WebCacheV01.dat</code> file, we will use <code class="inlineCode">ESEDatabaseView</code> (we first used it in <em class="chapterRef">Chapter 6</em>, <em class="italic">Windows Artifact Analysis</em>). Export the database from the forensic image to analyze it.</p>
    <p class="normal">The first table you will want to look at is the <code class="inlineCode">Containers</code> table, and you should see something similar to what is depicted in the following screenshot:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B18329_09_13.png" alt="A screenshot of a computer  Description automatically generated with medium confidence"/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 9.13: ESE database showing the Containers table</p>
    <p class="normal">There are 16 tables in the database, and the containers of interest are tables <code class="inlineCode">12</code>, <code class="inlineCode">14</code>, <code class="inlineCode">15</code>, and <code class="inlineCode">16</code>. When you look at the names of the tables, they start with <code class="inlineCode">MSHist01</code>, followed by numbers.</p>
    <p class="normal">The numbers tell us if the history file is a daily or a weekly file. In the following diagram, you can see the breakdown of the table name:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B18329_09_14.png" alt="Diagram  Description automatically generated"/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 9.14: The Daily history folder naming convention</p>
    <p class="normal">The name<a id="_idIndexMarker827"/> contains the period of time the history covers. As shown<a id="_idIndexMarker828"/> in the preceding diagram, the data it contains spans from August 29, 2019, to August 30, 2019. In the following diagram, we can see the breakdown of a weekly timeframe:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B18329_09_15.png" alt="Figure 9.12 – Weekly history naming convention "/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 9.15: Weekly history naming convention</p>
    <p class="normal">This data spans the time period from August 26, 2019, to September 2, 2019.</p>
    <p class="normal">For the <code class="inlineCode">MSHist01</code> files, the file path shown under the <code class="inlineCode">Directory</code> field is for legacy purposes. If you follow the path shown, you will find a file called <code class="inlineCode">container.dat</code> that does not contain any information. </p>
    <div><p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Note</strong></p>
      <p class="normal">For the rest of the entries, the file path will contain data corresponding to the specific table and may be relevant to your investigation. </p>
    </div>
    <p class="normal">Let’s look at the contents of table <code class="inlineCode">12</code>, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B18329_09_16.png" alt="Figure 9.13 – Contents of table 12 "/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 9.16: Contents of table 12</p>
    <p class="normal">Table <code class="inlineCode">12</code> is a<a id="_idIndexMarker829"/> daily history file, and it shows five entries for that day. When<a id="_idIndexMarker830"/> we look at the URL, it is not showing up as internet history but is depicting the files the user accessed with File Explorer. The user accessed the <code class="inlineCode">Windows Mail</code> folder and the <code class="inlineCode">Download</code> folder. It lists the specific filenames at the end of the path.</p>
    <p class="normal">The date and time values are a decimal conversion of the hexadecimal Windows 64-bit (Big Endian).</p>
    <p class="normal">To convert the values, you will need to do the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList">Take the decimal number, <code class="inlineCode">132115734791679663</code></li>
      <li class="bulletList">Convert it into hex, <code class="inlineCode">1D5 5E8F 917F 6EAF</code></li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">Then, you need to use DCode to get the date/timestamp:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B18329_09_17.png" alt="Figure 9.14 – DCode tool used to convert Windows Time value "/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 9.17: DCode tool used to convert the Windows Time value</p>
    <p class="normal">We have the<a id="_idIndexMarker831"/> user’s history, but does it show that the user willingly and knowingly visited the sites listed in the history? Is it possible there are references to websites the user never visited? The answer to those questions is yes. With popups and<a id="_idIndexMarker832"/> ads, it is possible to have a reference in the history file that the user never visited.</p>

    <p class="normal">Mozilla Firefox tracks the browser history<a id="_idIndexMarker865"/> in the SQLite database file called <code class="inlineCode">places.sqlite</code>. Firefox <a id="_idIndexMarker866"/>also tracks the users’ typed URLs in this database. You can use any SQLite database tool to read the file, or you can use the third-party open-source<a id="_idIndexMarker867"/> MZHistoryView (available at <a href="https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/mozilla_history_view.html">https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/mozilla_history_view.html</a>).

    <p class="normal">Passwords will be the next artifact we will discuss. </p>
    <h3 id="_idParaDest-209" class="heading-3">Passwords</h3>
    <p class="normal">Mozilla Firefox offers<a id="_idIndexMarker872"/> users the opportunity to save their passwords.

    <p class="normal">You can see the default bookmarks that are included with the Firefox browser. The last three entries are the bookmarks that users have added. We have a Google search for the term <code class="inlineCode">bad boys</code>, a web page referencing the actors Will Smith and Martin Lawrence, and the final entry is a YouTube video from the music group Inner Circle for their video Bad Boys.</p>
    <p class="normal">That completes our analysis of the browsers. We will start looking at social media in the next section.</p>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-211" class="heading-1">Social media</h1>
    <p class="normal">What is social media? Social media<a id="_idIndexMarker880"/> is the use of applications or programs to create and share information, forms of expression, opinions, ideas, and so on through virtual communities on the global internet. Users can access social media through web-based technology such as a mobile device application. In some situations, the user can sync data from one platform to another. These platforms/applications rarely require a fee from the user and are very simple to use.</p>
    <p class="normal">While most <a id="_idIndexMarker881"/>social media users use the services in a manner the service provider intended, some use these new communication media for nefarious purposes. It is a very unusual investigation where social media does not play a part in the investigation.</p>
    <p class="normal">The user’s social media communication leaves a digital trail of breadcrumbs for the investigator to follow. Sometimes, the investigator can determine the user’s location at the date/time when the incident being investigated occurred. Alternatively, they may find communications between the suspect and the victim that led to the incident being investigated.</p>
    <p class="normal">As a digital forensic investigator, you will have to be aware of the existence of social media and what potential artifacts exist in digital evidence. A significant challenge when searching social media is that the majority of the social media artifacts will not be saved to the user system. </p>
    <p class="normal">The applications store the data in the service provider’s cloud, which is a fancy way of saying the data will be on the service provider’s servers.</p>
    <p class="normal">Because of the vast diversity and sheer amount of social media applications, there is not a simple checklist that will cover all situations. The digital forensic investigator must be flexible in their investigation techniques when dealing with new social media technology or changing social media technology.</p>
    <p class="normal">The goal of this section is to familiarize you with some current social media applications and to provide you with a general plan for your investigation. Remember, when conducting an analysis dealing with social media, there may be two locations for you to find digital evidence relating to your investigation: the user system and the service provider. Do not neglect to serve the appropriate judicial paperwork on the service provider; typically, they will give you extensive information regarding your investigation.</p>
    <p class="normal">The popularity of specific social media ebbs and flows as the users’ demographic changes. Some younger users are disinclined to use Facebook with their friends because their parents and grandparents also use Facebook. Some social media applications may be restricted to geographical locations; for example, KaKaoTalk is very popular in the Republic of Korea but has very few users in the United States. The following is a short description of some popular social media applications that you may come across during your investigations:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList">Facebook: The most<a id="_idIndexMarker882"/> extensive social media application with nearly 2,000,000,000 users. It combines commercial advertisers and consumer users with their content. It is easy to use. Users can upload images, recorded videos, live videos, and voice/video/text chat via the messenger application.</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Instagram: A photo and<a id="_idIndexMarker883"/> video sharing social media application. Users can share photos, recorded videos, and live videos. Users can also chat and comment with other users via the app.</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Snapchat: A <a id="_idIndexMarker884"/>video/photo-sharing social media application. Initially, when a user sent a “snap” after the recipient viewed the image, it would be deleted from the system. Now, users have the option of saving “snaps.”</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Twitter: A social <a id="_idIndexMarker885"/>media application used for news, politics, sports, entertainment, and so on. Twitter allows 280-character tweets, with longer tweets being linked in the following messages.</li>
      <li class="bulletList">WhatsApp: A <a id="_idIndexMarker886"/>messaging application that allows users to engage in voice/video chat.</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Tinder: A location-based social <a id="_idIndexMarker887"/>media application used as a dating service. Users “swipe right” or “swipe left” on profiles they like/dislike. If both parties “like” each other, then they can chat using the app.</li>
      <li class="bulletList">GroupMe: This <a id="_idIndexMarker888"/>is a group messaging application. Users can use their cell phone number or their Facebook or Twitter account to log in to the app. Users can share photos, videos, locations, and text.</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Kik: An instant<a id="_idIndexMarker889"/> messaging social media application. The service provider is based in Canada. It allows anonymous communication between individuals. Users can share text, photos, and videos. It is estimated that nearly 40 percent of teenagers in the United States use the application. Kik was acquired by MediaLab in 2019.</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Tumblr: A <a id="_idIndexMarker890"/>blogging/social networking application. Users can post pictures/videos to a blog page.</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Reddit: This is <a id="_idIndexMarker891"/>a news aggregation and discussion social media application. It contains almost every topic imaginable, including illegal activities. In July 2019, it was the number five most visited website in the United States.</li>
      <li class="bulletList">TikTok: A<a id="_idIndexMarker892"/> video-based social networking application. Users can post videos and have “live” streaming events. TikTok was the third fastest-growing social media brand in 2020.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">This is not a complete list of social media applications you may encounter, nor would I attempt to create such a list. Social media applications will change as technology changes, and as user choices grow, new social media applications will come to the forefront. As a digital forensic investigator, it will be impossible for you to know all the facets of social media applications. You need to understand what social media applications are being used and how consumers and criminals use them. Some social media applications will not have the means to be accessed via the localhost; the service provider will restrict them to a mobile device only. How can you determine if the subject of your investigation is using a social media platform? The web browser history will be essential; they may access their profile/account via a web browser or email communication between the user and the service provider. One of the more popular social media applications you may come across is Facebook.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-212" class="heading-2">Facebook</h2>
    <p class="normal">Facebook<a id="_idIndexMarker893"/> is a social media platform that a user can access via the web browser. Analyzing those artifacts may give you the username or the Facebook user ID. Let’s say you analyze an URL, such as the one displayed here:</p>
    <p class="normal"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10215539711464494&amp;set=a.1627301761019&amp;type=3&amp;source=11&amp;referrer_profile_id=1190817474">https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10215539711464494&amp;set =a.1627301761019&amp;type=3&amp;source=11&amp;referrer_profile_id=1190817474</a></p>
    <p class="normal">As you examine the URL, the portion relevant to our organization is the profile ID, which is as follows: </p>
    <pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">profile_id=1190817474
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">When you add the numbers to the end of <code class="inlineCode">Facebook.com</code>, it will take you to the user’s Facebook page. The profile ID is a unique number and will redirect you to the user’s Facebook username, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B18329_09_27.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 9.27: Facebook URL</p>
    <p class="normal">Once you have obtained the user’s <a id="_idIndexMarker894"/>Facebook profile ID number and username, that information can then be given to the service provider as part of the judicial paperwork. This can be used to access the content being stored on the service provider’s servers.</p>
    <p class="normal">Another tool that you can use is <a id="_idIndexMarker895"/>Bulk Extractor (which we discussed in <em class="chapterRef">Chapter 7</em>, <em class="italic">RAM Memory Forensic Analysis</em>). When you run Bulk Extractor, it will also find the profile ID numbers, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B18329_09_28.png" alt="Text  Description automatically generated"/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 9.28: Bulk Extractor output for Facebook</p>
    <p class="normal">You can run Bulk Extractor against the forensic image or a captured memory file to find artifacts relating to social media. Another very popular social media application you may come across is Twitter.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-213" class="heading-2">Twitter</h2>
    <p class="normal">We can filter the results<a id="_idIndexMarker896"/> from the domain histogram, as shown in the following screenshot. Here, we can see the user accessed the Twitter web page:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B18329_09_29.png" alt="Graphical user interface, text  Description automatically generated"/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 9.29: Bulk Extractor output for Twitter</p>
    <p class="normal">Twitter <a id="_idIndexMarker897"/>users have a “handle” and a UID (user ID) when they sign up for the service. Users can change their handle whenever they desire, but the UID will remain the same. If we have a user with the handle of <code class="inlineCode">@badguyneedslove</code> and then they change it to <code class="inlineCode">@badguy27</code>, the UID will stay the same. </p>
    <p class="normal">Searching for the term <code class="inlineCode">twid</code> in the forensic image will identify the UID for the account. You can also take the user’s Twitter handle and use the following website: <a href="http://gettwitterid.com">http://gettwitterid.com</a>.</p>
    <p class="normal">This will give you the UID when you input the Twitter handle, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B18329_09_30.png" alt="Graphical user interface, text, application, chat or text message  Description automatically generated"/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 9.30: Twitter ID</p>
    <p class="normal">We entered the <a id="_idIndexMarker898"/>Twitter handle of <code class="inlineCode">badguyneedslove</code>, and it gave us the Twitter ID of <code class="inlineCode">1170432764291665920</code>, as well as the full name of the user (which may or may not be accurate; remember this is user-supplied information).</p>
    <p class="normal">Not all the information you want or need for your investigation will be found on the user’s device; you may have to reach out to the service provider to get the information that is being stored on the service provider’s servers.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-214" class="heading-2">Service provider</h2>
    <p class="normal">Much of the <a id="_idIndexMarker899"/>information you need for your investigation will be in the care and custody of the service provider. They will have the subscriber information such as the name, address, age, usage dates/times, and IP addresses. This content is hosted on the service provider’s servers. This seized computer system or mobile device may not have all the information you want as you conduct your investigation. Serve the service provider with the appropriate judicial paperwork to get that information. The judicial framework will be based on where the service provider is located. You will have to meet all the requirements of the service provider’s judicial system.</p>
    <p class="normal"><a href="https://Search.org">Search.org</a> maintains a service provider list and the contact information of the legal department that will receive the completed judicial paperwork. Some service providers also provide that information on their website. For example, the service provider Kik has created a specific web page (located at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201224090043/https://lawenforcement.kik.com/hc/en-us">https://web.archive.org/web/20201224090043/https://lawenforcement.kik.com/hc/en-us</a>) that contains all the information needed by the investigator to serve them with additional paperwork.</p>
    <p class="normal">Investigating a user’s activity on social media can be difficult. You may have to use third-party software or manually parse through the hexadecimal data stored on the storage device. Even with all that effort, it may come down to the retention policies of the service provider for you to get the information you need to make your investigation successful. Another aspect of the internet that has the potential for criminal use is P2P file sharing, which is our next topic.</p>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-215" class="heading-1">P2P file sharing</h1>
    <p class="normal">P2P file sharing <a id="_idIndexMarker900"/>allows users to share files with others in the P2P community. Users will share videos or music files with the community, but you can find almost any file type you can imagine. P2P has legitimate and illegitimate uses, depending on the user’s search criteria. It is a popular method of sharing illicit images and videos with other users in the P2P community. There are several P2P applications the user can choose from. I cannot give a detailed analysis of all potential P2P applications, but we will discuss some more common P2P applications you may run into during your investigations.</p>
    <p class="normal">P2P applications allow the user to become a node on the network. When the user installs the application, they can designate which files/folders they want to make available to the P2P network. The application will then create an index of the shared files/folders to share on the P2P network. When the user searches the P2P network and finds a file they wish to download, the application will identify all the nodes possessing that file. The application will then connect to the nodes and start downloading pieces of the file from all the available nodes.</p>
    <p class="normal">When the P2P application shares the files/folders, it tracks the filename and the file type and creates a SHA-1 hash value for the file. This will be a variation of the SHA-1 hash value used by the commercial and open-source forensic tools. The P2P version of the SHA-1 creates a hash value using the Base32 numbering system, while the forensic tools use the Base16 numbering system. The Base16 numbering system uses the alphanumeric characters 0–9 and A–F, while the Base32 numbering system uses the alphanumeric characters A–Z and 2–7. Chris Hurst posted how to use Python to convert Base32 values into Base16 (available at <a href="https://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent/wiki/How-to-convert-base32-to-base16-info-hashes">https://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent/wiki/How-to-convert-base32-to-base16-info-hashes</a>). </p>
    <p class="normal">The following is the Python code that Chris Hurst provided:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting con"><code class="hljs-con">&gt;&gt;&gt; import base64 
&gt;&gt;&gt; b32Hash = "WRN7ZT6NKMA6SSXYKAFRUGDDIFJUNKI2"
&gt;&gt;&gt; b16Hash = base64.b16encode(base64.b32decode(b32Hash))
&gt;&gt;&gt; b16Hash = b16Hash.lower()
&gt;&gt;&gt; print (b16Hash)
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">After you spend some time working in the field of digital forensics, you will learn the artifacts you may find depend on the operating system, the P2P application, and if the user has modified<a id="_idIndexMarker901"/> any of the default settings. </p>
    <p class="normal">We will now investigate some of the common P2P applications you may encounter during your digital forensic investigations.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-216" class="heading-2">Ares</h2>

    <h1 id="_idParaDest-219" class="heading-1">Cloud computing</h1>
    <p class="normal">What is<a id="_idIndexMarker913"/> cloud computing? Is it remote storage? Is it a remote server? Is it remote services? The answer to all of the above is yes. Cloud-based services are becoming more popular for businesses and users every day. As a digital forensic investigator, you must know of the potential for cloud-based evidence. We have already discussed some aspects of cloud-based artifacts in this chapter. Now, we will discuss some different elements of cloud-based computing. There are various service models of cloud-based computing you may encounter when conducting your digital forensic investigation. They are as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Infrastructure as a Service</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">IaaS</strong>): The remote infrastructure is offered to the customer<a id="_idIndexMarker914"/> for use, while the provider maintains ownership and control of the hardware. The customer only pays for the hardware/service needed and gives the customer the flexibility to increase/decrease hardware requirements as required.</li>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Software as a Service</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">SaaS</strong>): Applications are provided to the customer via the network. The<a id="_idIndexMarker915"/> customer pays a subscription fee to the vendor to use the software. The content and the user files are stored on the service provider’s servers but can be used/shared with other members of the organization.</li>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Platform as a Service</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">PaaS</strong>): The operating system of the client is provided to the customer <a id="_idIndexMarker916"/>via a cloud server. The user can then install their applications and maintain their settings of the software, while the provider manages the hardware and operating system. The client is responsible for the system administration within their network.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">Another consideration is the deployment method of cloud resources. There are four to choose from:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Public cloud</strong>: A cloud resource that is made available to the public or specific members of an <a id="_idIndexMarker917"/>organization. Local government, universities, or a sector of the community can offer a public cloud resource.</li>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Private cloud</strong>: A <a id="_idIndexMarker918"/>cloud resource that is made available to specific members. The user must have specific rights to access the resource. For example, an organization may maintain a private cloud resource for employees only.</li>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Community cloud</strong>: A cloud resource that is similar to a private cloud, where the users comprise <a id="_idIndexMarker919"/>multiple organizations with a similar focus. For example, a cloud provider may restrict access to a cloud resource that’s used by numerous law enforcement agencies to law enforcement only.</li>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Hybrid cloud</strong>: A cloud <a id="_idIndexMarker920"/>resource that is made up of two or more different deployment methods.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">As you can see, the use of <a id="_idIndexMarker921"/>cloud computing can directly affect what artifacts you find or do not find on the local system. It is entirely possible that there will not be any artifacts relating to your investigation on the local system, which then leads to the question, where are the artifacts/evidence?</p>
    <p class="normal">The answer to that question is anywhere in the world. The data/artifact you may be looking for may be stored on a server located one mile away or several thousand miles away in another jurisdiction. Investigating when the hardware is not physically available creates significant issues for the digital forensic investigator. If you are law enforcement and you have a search warrant, is the search warrant valid for data maintained by the service provider outside of your jurisdiction? For the corporate investigator, a search warrant is not an option, but if the data is stored in a jurisdiction where the privacy expectations differ from where the investigation is based, you may also run into issues with accessing the data.</p>
    <p class="normal">In the United States, this issue was in dispute until 2018 and would have been decided by the United States Supreme Court. Ultimately, the issue was resolved at the legislative level when Congress clarified the Stored Communications Act and now requires the service provider to provide the requested data if the information “is located within or outside of the United States.”</p>
    <p class="normal">For the corporate investigator, the <strong class="keyWord">service-level agreement</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">SLA</strong>) should spell out who may access the data and specify if there <a id="_idIndexMarker922"/>are to be any limitations when conducting a data acquisition in response to an investigation. The SLA should also address the geographical location of where the data may or may not be stored and address how legal conflicts should be resolved when the data is stored in different jurisdictions.</p>
    <p class="normal">Different countries provide different protections regarding privacy issues and criminal and/or civil procedures. What may be a crime in one jurisdiction may not be in the jurisdiction where the server containing the data is located. In the <strong class="keyWord">European Union</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">EU</strong>), EU citizens must be notified before their personal information is accessed, and they must give their consent.</p>
    <p class="normal">Once you have been given access to the data that is needed for your digital forensic investigation, you still must deal with the best practices for handling evidence. You may have a chain of custody issues; how do you know if the provider used a forensically sound methodology to collect the evidence? Can you validate the methodology to show that they collected all relevant information? You do not want the opposition in judicial/administrative proceedings to allege that exculpatory evidence was not collected and presented to the fact finder.</p>
    <p class="normal">When conducting a digital forensic investigation, there are some artifacts you can examine that will show if the user has accessed any cloud-based applications. In this chapter, we have discussed the cache of web browsers and what happens if the user accesses the cloud-based applications with the web browser. In <em class="chapterRef">Chapter 6</em>, <em class="italic">Windows Artifact Analysis</em>, we discussed examining the prefetch files. Remember that prefetch files are used to speed up the application’s startup and will contain date/timestamps showing when the user last accessed that resource.</p>
    <p class="normal">Dropbox<a id="_idIndexMarker923"/> and Google Drive<a id="_idIndexMarker924"/> are two of the most common cloud-based storage options available to the consumer. When the user installs the Dropbox or Google Drive application, the system will create a folder where the user can sync the data to the localhost and the cloud-based storage. As the user changes the local file, the system will then change the file maintained in the cloud-based storage. Alternatively, the user can upload/change a file via a web-based interface using a shared or public computer, and the system will then change the file or the uploaded file available on the user’s personal device(s).</p>
    <p class="normal">When using the Dropbox application, there will be two databases of interest to the digital forensic investigator:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList"><code class="inlineCode">config.dbx</code>: Contains the user ID, account email address, account username, and path for the <code class="inlineCode">dropbox</code> folder.</li>
      <li class="bulletList"><code class="inlineCode">filecache.dbx</code>: Contains the <code class="inlineCode">file journal</code> table, which includes information about the files being synchronized between the localhost and the cloud-based storage. The table will consist of the filename, file path, and file size in the local host ID. The localhost ID is how we identify the host that placed the file into the Dropbox storage.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">If you are investigating a user who is using the cloud-based storage Google Drive, the following databases may be of interest:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList"><code class="inlineCode">sync_config.db</code>: This will contain the path of the Google Drive folder on the localhost, show if USB devices are being synced, and show the email account associated with the Google Drive account.</li>
      <li class="bulletList"><code class="inlineCode">snapshot.db</code>: The <code class="inlineCode">local_entry</code> table will contain information about the files that have been synced between the localhost and the cloud-based storage. This will include the serial number of the volume, the filename, the modified date/timestamps, the file size, and show if it is a file or a folder.</li>
      <li class="bulletList">The <code class="inlineCode">cloud_entry</code> table will contain the filename, the modified date/timestamps, the file size, and show if the user shares the file with other users.</li>
      <li class="bulletList"><code class="inlineCode">Device_db.db</code>: The <code class="inlineCode">external_devices</code> table will contain the device ID, USB device label, upload date/timestamps, and show if the user has synchronized the device to the cloud-based storage.</li>
      <li class="bulletList">The <code class="inlineCode">device_files</code> table will contain the device ID of the USB device, the filename of the synced file, the file path, and the date/timestamp of when the file was synchronized to cloud-based storage.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">Like most technology, cloud-based computing is rapidly evolving and changing. As the number of consumers who use cloud-based technology grows, so will the number of evidentiary artifacts you will have to examine when conducting your digital forensic investigation. You will always have to be mindful of the potential use of cloud-based computing when conducting your digital forensic investigations.</p>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-220" class="heading-1">Summary</h1>
    <p class="normal">In this chapter, we focused on what artifacts may be created by the user as they use a web browser. We covered different web browsers and looked at social media applications. We discussed various social media applications and what artifacts they may leave behind. There may be minimal artifacts left on the user’s system, but there may be additional artifacts on the user’s mobile device or in the possession of the service provider. </p>
    <p class="normal">We also went into P2P file sharing and what artifacts this will leave on the user’s system. You should now be able to understand and identify the different browsers and artifacts that can be found. You should be able to understand and identify the most popular social media applications and the common locations where artifacts could be found. You should also be able to understand the basic structure and operation of P2P file-sharing networks and be familiar with typical P2P file-sharing client applications and artifacts.</p>
    <p class="normal">In the next chapter, we will be focusing on report writing. You may be able to find every possible artifact indicating the guilt or innocence of a subject. Still, if you cannot create a report that technical and non-technical readers easily understand, you will lose your audience. If the reader cannot understand your report, they will never know what user activities you uncovered during your investigation.</p>
