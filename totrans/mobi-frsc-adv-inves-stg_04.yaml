- en: When approaching an Android smartphone, there is no straightforward route to
    acquisition. Due to extremely high fragmentation of the Android platform, your
    approach to acquiring an Android smartphone will vary greatly between devices.
    Your approach will depend on who made the device and what chipset was used; what
    version of Android it is running and what version of Android it was originally
    released with; whether or not the device has an unlocked (or unlockable) bootloader,
    and whether it was or can be rooted. If that's not enough, you'll have different
    options depending on the encryption status of the device (which also depends on
    the device's make, model, and version of Android).

    acquisition methods available for a wide range of Android devices. We'll discuss
    how to use manufacturer-specific low-level service modes (LG, Qualcomm, and Mediatek),
    how to use custom recoveries (**ClockworkMod** (**CWM**) and **Team Win Recovery
    Project** (**TWRP**)) for dumping the data partition, and how to make NANDroid
    backups and use command-line tools such as **dd** for live-imaging the device.
    We'll talk about encryption and its effect on physical acquisition.

    Do you have a bootloader that is unlocked (or at least semi-unlocked)? Does the
    device have root access installed, or do you have the means to root it? Is a service

    Open Source Project** (**AOSP**)) a seriously flawed encryption method. This method
    was compromised as experts were able to extract decryption keys from the device
    and use it to decrypt user data. Decryption metadata was kept unencrypted, thus
    extracting the metadata made it possible to decrypt the data partition.

    scheme that encrypted the decryption metadata. As a result, encrypted Samsung

    encrypted. While decryption metadata can be extracted via physical imaging, JTAG,

    receive a ready-to-use PCB design complete with pre-selected components and drivers.
    In addition to this, some reference platforms expose service-access backdoors.
    The reference platform provided by Qualcomm, one of the largest chipset manufacturers,
    includes several service modes. One of these modes, **HS-USB 9006** or **mode

    the device ships with a locked or unlocked bootloader.

    off, connecting it to the computer via a USB cord while holding the volume up
    key, and powering on the device while still holding the volume up key (details

    into the service mode, the Windows **Disk Management** console will display a
    list of available partitions. Note that a dedicated Qualcomm Download Mode HS-USB
    9006 driver must be installed on the expert's computer for the partitions to appear.

    imaging via dd* section for more information). The `dd` method returns a full
    dump of either the entire eMMC storage or just the data partition. A Nandroid
    backup contains the full filesystem of the data partition; unallocated space is
    not included, which makes recovering deleted files impossible. This method is
    relatively easy to use, but requires some technical expertise. Nandroid backups

    backups can be produced by booting the device into a custom recovery, such as
    CWM or TWRP (by either issuing an ADB command or, if **USB debugging** is not

    (or both) in order to make Nandroid backups, this is not completely true. Technically
    speaking, all you need to make a Nandroid backup is a custom recovery, such as
    CWM or TWRP. Granted, many devices require root access for the user to install
    custom recovery, and the bootloader must be unlocked in order to be able to install
    the custom recovery. However, the user may safely relock bootloader after installing
    custom recovery, which will not affect the ability to produce Nandroid backups.
    In addition, many devices can safely boot into a custom recovery (via `fastboot
    boot recovery.img`) as opposed to permanently installing one, even if the bootloader
    is officially locked. For the purpose of mobile forensics, booting into a custom
    recovery is a much cleaner and more forensically sound method of imaging the device.

    online behavior and offline activities. Google analyzes search queries and communications,
    and recommends places to visit and things to read. Google collects and maintains
    a comprehensive location history; stores all Google searches performed on registered
    desktop and mobile devices; syncs Chrome tabs, bookmarks, passwords, and history;
    keeps notes; annotates pictures; syncs contacts; and does a lot more.

    Windows Phone counterparts. While prerelease versions of Android 6.0 allowed third-party
    apps to *opt-out* from data backups (the default behavior was *backups enabled
    for all apps that did not opt out via manifest*), the release version of Android
    6.0 did not retain this change.
  prefs: []

- en: The final version of Android 6.0 uses the *opt-in* method, allowing application
    developers to explicitly allow backups for their apps through the manifest file.
    The default behavior is *no data backups*. As of today, very few apps have made
    use of this feature. This includes Google's own apps, which don't use the new
    backup feature of Android 6.0\. Instead, they use Google Drive to back up their
    data.
