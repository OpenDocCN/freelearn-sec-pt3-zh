<p>In the previous chapter, we covered various logical and physical extraction techniques. In physical extraction, a bit-by-bit image of the Android device is obtained, which contains valuable information. In this chapter, we will learn how to analyze and extract relevant data, such as call logs and text messages, from an image file. While the data extraction and analysis techniques provide information about various details, not all techniques can provide information about the deleted data. Data recovery is a crucial aspect of mobile forensics, as it helps to unearth the deleted items.</p>
<p>This chapter aims at covering various techniques, that can be used by a forensic analyst to recover the data from an Android device.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we will cover the following two major topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Analyzing and extracting data from Android image files using the Autopsy tool</li>
<li>Understanding techniques to recover deleted files from an SD card and the internal memory</li>
</ul>

<p>The term <strong>Android image</strong> refers to the physical image (also called a forensic image or raw image) that is obtained by performing any of the physical data extraction techniques. Using the techniques explained in <em><a href="bf232566-3a17-4914-992b-80674dd379de.xhtml"/></em><a href="bf232566-3a17-4914-992b-80674dd379de.xhtml">Chapter 9</a>, <em>Android Data Extraction Techniques</em>, you can image the entire <kbd>/data/data</kbd> block or any particular block that is of relevance to the investigation. Once the image is obtained, an investigator like you can manually go through the contents of the file or take advantage of the available tools to parse through the contents. Commercial tools, such as Cellebrite and XRY, can drill into the data and present a comprehensive picture of the contents. Autopsy is one of the very widely used open source tools in the forensics world that performs an excellent job of analyzing an Android image.</p>

<p>Autopsy is a forensic platform and acts as a GUI for the Sleuth Kit. It is available for free; you can download it at <a href="http://www.sleuthkit.org/"><span class="URLPACKT">http://www.sleuthkit.org/</span></a>. The Sleuth Kit is a collection of Unix and Windows-based tools and utilities, which are used to perform forensic analysis. Autopsy displays the results by forensically analyzing a given volume, and thereby helps investigators to focus on relevant sections of the data. Autopsy is free and extensible and has several modules that can be plugged in. Autopsy can be used to load and analyze an Android image that is obtained after physical extraction.</p>

<p>Once you have downloaded and installed Autopsy, follow these steps to add an image to Autopsy:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the Autopsy tool and select the <span class="packt_screen">Create New Case</span> option, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1116 image-border" src="assets/7bcd8c15-85e4-473c-b9b5-a5d2ba2da1de.png" style="width:34.08em;height:23.25em;"/></p>
<div class="packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">Creating a new case in Autopsy</div>
<ol start="2">
<li>Enter all of the necessary case details, including the name of the case, the location where data needs to be stored, and so on, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1117 image-border" src="assets/56ad49d1-b9fc-41b8-bb2f-15104f4a7417.png" style="width:47.50em;height:22.58em;"/></p>
<div class="packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">Entering case information in Autopsy</div>
<ol start="3">
<li>Enter the case number and examiner details, and click on <span class="packt_screen">Finish</span>.</li>
<li>Now, click on the <span class="packt_screen">Add Data Source</span> button, add the image file to be analyzed, and click on <span class="packt_screen">Next</span>:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1118 image-border" src="assets/19d316c7-1514-472b-b0ba-d2068d1843a4.png" style="width:49.67em;height:24.17em;"/></p>
<div class="packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">Entering data source information in Autopsy</div>
<ol start="5">
<li>On the next screen, you can configure what modules have to be run on the images, as shown in the following screenshot. It is recommended to select the <span class="packt_screen">Recent Activity</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Exif Parser</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Keyword Search</span>, and <span class="packt_screen">Android Analyzer</span> modules.

<p>Once the image is loaded, expand the file present under <span class="packt_screen">Data Sources</span> to see data present in the image. For example, the following screenshot shows the contents of the <kbd>/data/</kbd> folder:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/f59c327a-baa5-44f9-9d76-2411f1a28b8b.png" style="width:53.25em;height:38.67em;"/></p>
<div class="packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">Analyzing an image in Autopsy</div>
<p>In the preceding example, only the <kbd>/data</kbd> portion of the device has been imaged. If the entire device had been imaged, then the tool would show more volumes. Depending on the underlying details of the investigation, relevant portions need to be analyzed. In the following example, by examining the folders present under <kbd>com.android.browser</kbd>, we can extract the list of various sites visited by the user along with their access dates:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/c32ae2e2-df40-4ebd-a120-e66c47f35afc.png" style="width:59.00em;height:19.25em;"/></p>
<div class="packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">Analyzing browsing details in Autopsy</div>
<p>Valuable data, such as text messages, browsing history, chats, call history, pictures, videos, and location details, could be unearthed by analyzing the data present under various sections. In the next section, we shall look into data recovery from an SD card and the internal memory.</p>

<p>Data recovery is one of the most significant and powerful aspects of forensic analysis. The ability to recover deleted data can be crucial to crack many civil and criminal cases. From a normal user's point of view, recovering data that has been deleted would usually refer to the operating system's built-in solutions, such as the Recycle Bin in Windows. While it's true that data can be recovered from these locations, due to an increase in user awareness, these options don't often work. For instance, on a desktop computer, people now use <em><span class="KeyPACKT">Shift</span></em> + <em><span class="KeyPACKT">Delete</span></em> as a way to delete a file completely from their desktop.</p>
<p>Data recovery is the process of retrieving deleted data from a device when it cannot be accessed normally. Consider the scenario where a mobile phone has been seized from a terrorist. Wouldn't it be of the greatest importance to know which items were deleted by the terrorist? Access to any deleted SMS messages, pictures, dialed numbers, application data, and more can be of critical importance, as they often reveal sensitive information. With Android, it is possible to recover most of the deleted data if the device files are properly acquired. However, if proper care is not taken while handling the device, the deleted data could be lost forever. To ensure that the deleted data is not overwritten, it is recommended to keep the following points in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not use the phone for any activity after seizing it. The deleted data exists on the device until space is needed by some other incoming data. Hence, the phone must not be used for any sort of activity to prevent the data from being overwritten.</li>
<li>Even when the phone is not used, without any intervention from our end, data can be overwritten. For instance, an incoming SMS would automatically occupy space, which could overwrite the data marked for deletion. To prevent the occurrence of such events, you should follow the forensic handling methods described in the previous chapters. The easiest solution is to place the device in airplane mode or disable all connectivity options on the device. This prevents the delivery of any new messages.</li>
</ul>
<p>All Android filesystems have metadata that contains information about the hierarchy of files, filenames, and so on. Deletion will not really erase this data but remove the filesystem metadata. When text messages or any other files are deleted from the device, they are just made invisible to the user, but the files are still present on the device. Essentially, the files are simply marked for deletion, but they reside on the filesystem until being overwritten. Recovering deleted data from an Android device involves two scenarios: recovering data that is deleted from the SD card, such as pictures, videos, application data, and more, and recovering data that is deleted from the internal memory of the device. The following sections cover the techniques that can be used to recover deleted data from both the SD card and the internal memory of the Android device.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Data present on SD cards can reveal a lot of information to forensic investigators. SD cards are capable of storing pictures and videos taken by the phone's camera, voice recordings, application data, cached files, and more. Essentially, anything that can be stored on a computer hard drive can be stored on an SD card as much as the available space allows.</p>
<p>Recovering the deleted data from an external SD card is a straightforward process. SD cards can be mounted as an external mass storage device and forensically acquired using standard digital forensic methods, as discussed in <a href="bf232566-3a17-4914-992b-80674dd379de.xhtml">Chapter 9</a>, <em>Android Data Extraction Techniques</em>. As mentioned in the previous chapters, SD cards in Android devices often use the FAT32 filesystem. The main reason for this is that the FAT32 filesystem is widely supported in most operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and macOS X. The maximum file size on a FAT32 formatted drive is around 4 GB. With increasingly high-resolution formats now available, this limit is commonly reached. Apart from this, FAT32 can only be used on partitions that are less than 32 GB in size. Hence, the exFAT filesystem, which overcomes these problems, is now being used in some of the devices.</p>
<p>Recovering the deleted data from an external SD card can be easily accomplished if it can be mounted as a drive. Hence, if the SD card is removable, connect it to a workstation using a write blocker for acquisition. However, the latest Android devices do not usually mount as a mass storage. This is because these devices use the <strong>Media Transfer Protocol</strong> (<strong>MTP</strong>) or <strong>Picture Transfer Protocol</strong> (<strong>PTP</strong>) protocols instead of USB mass storage. The problem with USB mass storage is that the computer would need exclusive access to the storage. In other words, the external storage needs to be completely disconnected from the Android OS when it is connected to a workstation. This has led to several other complications for mobile apps. When an Android device uses MTP, it appears to the computer as a media device and not as <span class="packt_screen">Removable Storage</span>, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/0cc751b4-0dd5-42dd-8374-9e338934d118.png" style="width:23.67em;height:23.08em;"/></div>
<div class="packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><span>Android device connection using MTP</span></div>
<p>But the normal data recovery tools would need a mount drive to perform a scan. Hence, most of the latest devices that use MTP/PTP are not treated as a mount drive, and so the traditional data recovery tools that work for computers do not work on them.</p>
<p>For this reason, when the device uses MTP/PTP and is not mounted as a drive, the recovery can be done by certain Android-specific data recovery tools that need the USB debugging option to be turned on. Almost all Android data recovery tools in the market need you to enable USB debugging so that your device and the SD card can be recognized before starting Android data recovery.</p>
<p>You must understand that Android devices might use space on the SD card to cache application data; therefore, it is important to make sure that as much data as possible is obtained from the device prior to removing the SD card. Some older devices automatically mount the device as a drive when connected through USB. It is a sound forensic practice to not work directly on the device for data extraction, data recovery, and so on. Hence, a physical image of the SD card needs to be taken and all required analysis is performed on the image itself. It is recommended to acquire the SD card through the device as well as separately to ensure that all data is obtained. To achieve the SD card image, <kbd>dd</kbd> through <kbd>adb</kbd> can be used while the device is running to obtain an image of the SD card of the device if the device cannot be powered off due to possible evidence running in the memory. If the SD card is removed and connected to the workstation through a card reader, it appears as external mass storage, which can then be imaged using the standard forensic techniques described in earlier chapters.</p>
<p>Once the image is obtained, it can be analyzed using any standard forensic tools, such as FTK Imager. FTK Imager is a simple tool that can be used to create and analyze disk images. It is available for download at <a href="https://accessdata.com/product-download/ftk-imager-version-3.2.0"><span class="URLPACKT">https://accessdata.com/product-download/ftk-imager-version-3.2.0</span></a>.</p>
<p>The following is a step-by-step process to recover the deleted files from an SD card image using FTK Imager:</p>
<ol>
<li>Start FTK Imager and click on <span class="packt_screen">File</span>, then click on <span class="packt_screen">Add Evidence Item...</span> in the menu:</li>
</ol>

<div class="packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">Selecting the image file for analysis in FTK Imager</div>
<ol start="4">
<li>The contents of the SD card image are then shown in the <span class="packt_screen">View</span> pane. You can browse through the folders by clicking on the + sign.

<div class="packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">Recovering deleted images in FTK Imager</div>
<p>It is also recommended to check whether the device has any backup applications or files installed. The initial release of Android did not include a mechanism for users to back up their personal data. Hence, several backup applications were used extensively by users. Using these apps, users can back up their data either to the SD card or to the cloud. For example, the <strong>Super Backup</strong> app contains the options to back up call logs, contacts, SMS, and more, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/3613f886-2579-4196-8738-221a53c6ba08.png" style="width:12.33em;height:16.67em;"/></p>
<div class="packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">The Super Backup Android app</div>
<p>Upon detection of a backup application, you must attempt to determine where the data is stored. Usually, the backup folder path is the internal SD card. The folder path is also present in the backup app's settings. The data saved in a backup may contain important information, and hence, looking for any third-party backup app on the device would be very helpful.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>Recovering files that are deleted from an Android device's internal memory (such as SMS, contacts, and app data) is not supported by all analytical tools and may require manual carving. Unlike some media containing common filesystems, such as SD cards, the filesystem may not be recognized and mounted by forensic tools. Also, you cannot get access to the raw partitions of the internal memory of an Android phone unless the phone is rooted. It is recommended to image the device before and after the rooting process happens. The following are some of the other issues that you may face when attempting to recover data from the internal memory on Android devices:</p>
<ul>
<li>To get access to the internal memory, you can try to root the phone. However, the rooting process might involve writing some data to the <kbd>/data</kbd> partition, and this process could overwrite the data of value on the device.</li>
<li>Unlike SD cards, the internal filesystem here is not FAT32 (which is widely supported by forensic tools). The internal filesystem could be YAFFS2 (on older devices), EXT3, EXT4, RFS, or something proprietary built to run on Android. Therefore, many of the recovery tools designed for use with Windows filesystems won't work.</li>
<li>Application data on Android devices is commonly stored in the SQLite format. While most forensic tools provide access to the database files, they may have to be exported and viewed in a native browser. You must examine the raw data to ensure that the deleted data is not overlooked by the forensic tool.</li>
</ul>
<p>The discussed reasons make it difficult, but not impossible, to recover the deleted data from the internal memory. The internal memory of Android devices holds the bulk of the user data and the possible keys to your investigation. As previously mentioned, the device must be rooted to access the raw partitions. Most of the Android recovery tools on the market do not highlight the fact that they only work on rooted phones. Let's now take a look at how we can recover deleted data from an Android phone.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Recovering deleted files by parsing SQLite files</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Android uses SQLite files to store most data. Data related to text messages, emails, and certain app data is stored in SQLite files. SQLite databases can store deleted data within the database itself. Files marked for deletion by the user no longer appear in the active SQLite database files. Therefore, it is possible to recover the deleted data, such as text messages and contacts. There are two areas within a SQLite page that can contain deleted data—unallocated blocks and free blocks.</p>
<p>Most of the commercial tools that recover deleted data scan the unallocated blocks and free blocks of the SQLite pages. Parsing the deleted data can be done using the available forensic tools, such as <strong>Oxygen Forensics SQLite Viewer</strong>. The trial version of the SQLite Viewer can be used for this purpose; however, there are certain limitations on the amount of data that you can recover. You can write your own script to parse the files for deleted content, and for this, you need to have a good understanding of the SQLite file format. The <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/fileformat.html"><span class="URLPACKT">http://www.sqlite.org/fileformat.html</span></a> page <span>is a good place to start. If you do not want to reinvent the wheel and want to reuse the existing scripts, you can try the available open source Python scripts (</span><a href="http://az4n6.blogspot.in/2013/11/python-parser-to-recover-deleted-sqlite.html"><span class="URLPACKT">http://az4n6.blogspot.in/2013/11/python-parser-to-recover-deleted-sqlite.html</span></a><span>) to parse the SQLite files for deleted records.</span></p>
<p>For our example, we will recover deleted SMSes from an Android device. Recovering deleted SMSs from an Android phone is quite often requested as part of the forensic analysis of a device, mainly because text messages contain data, which can reveal a lot of information. There are different ways to recover deleted text messages on an Android device. First, we need to understand where the messages are being stored on the device. In <a href="bf232566-3a17-4914-992b-80674dd379de.xhtml"/><a href="bf232566-3a17-4914-992b-80674dd379de.xhtml">Chapter 9</a>, <em>Android Data Extraction Techniques</em>, we explained the important locations on the Android device where user data is stored. Here is a quick recap of this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Every application stores its data under the <kbd>/data/data</kbd> folder (again, this requires root access to acquire data).</li>
<li>The files under the location, <kbd>/data/data/com.android.providers.telephony/databases</kbd>, contain details about the SMS/MMS.</li>
</ul>
<p>Under the mentioned locations, text messages are stored in an SQLite database file, which is named <kbd>mmssms.db</kbd>. Deleted text messages can be recovered by examining this file. Here are the steps to recover deleted SMSes using the <kbd>mmssms.db</kbd> file:</p>
<ol>

<p>File carving is an extremely useful method in forensics because it allows data that has been deleted or hidden to be recovered for analysis. In simple terms, file carving is the process of reassembling computer files from fragments in the absence of filesystem metadata. In file carving, specified file types are searched for and extracted across the binary data to create a forensic image of a partition or an entire disk. File carving recovers files from the unallocated space in a drive based merely on file structure and content without any matching filesystem metadata. Unallocated space refers to the part of the drive that no longer holds any file information indicated by the filesystem structures, such as the file table.</p>
<p>Files can be recovered or reconstructed by scanning the raw bytes of the disk and reassembling them. This can be done by examining the header (the first few bytes) and footer (the last few bytes) of a file.</p>
<p>File-carving methods are categorized based on the underlying technique in use. The header-footer carving method relies on recovering the files based on their header and footer information. For instance, for JPEG files, these start with <kbd>0xffd8</kbd> and end with <kbd>0xffd9</kbd>.</p>
<p>The locations of the header and footer are identified and everything between those two endpoints is carved. Similarly, the carving method based on the file structure uses the internal layout of a file to reconstruct the file. However, the traditional file-carving techniques, such as the ones that we've already explained, may not work if the data is fragmented. To overcome this, new techniques, such as smart carving, use the fragmentation characteristics of several popular filesystems to recover the data.</p>
<p>Once the phone is imaged, it can be analyzed using tools such as <strong>Scalpel</strong>. Scalpel is a powerful open source utility to carve files. This tool analyzes the block database storage, identifies the deleted files, and recovers them. Scalpel is filesystem-independent and is known to work on various filesystems, including FAT, NTFS, EXT2, EXT3, HFS, and more. More details about Scalpel can be found at <a href="https://github.com/sleuthkit/scalpel"><span class="URLPACKT">https://github.com/sleuthkit/scalpel</span></a>. The following steps explain how to use Scalpel on an Ubuntu workstation:</p>
<ol>
<li>Install Scalpel on the Ubuntu workstation using the <kbd>sudo apt-get install scalpel</kbd> command.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>The <kbd>scalpel.conf</kbd> file present under the <kbd>/etc/scalpel</kbd> directory contains information about the supported file types, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/f4de510a-e735-4e48-9f5f-cb550289245a.png" style="width:43.17em;height:19.83em;"/></p>
<div class="packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">The scalpel configuration file</div>
<div class="packt_infobox">This file needs to be modified to mention the files that are related to Android. A sample <kbd>scalpel.conf</kbd> file can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.nowsecure.com/tools-and-trainings/#viaforensics"><span class="URLPACKT">https://www.nowsecure.com/tools-and-trainings/#viaforensics</span></a>. You can also uncomment the files and save the <kbd>conf</kbd> file to select file types of your choice. Once this is done, replace the original <kbd>conf</kbd> file with the one that is downloaded.</div>
<ol start="3">
<li>Scalpel needs to be run along with the preceding configuration file on the <kbd>dd</kbd> image being examined. You can run the tool using the following command by inputting the configuration file and the <kbd>dd</kbd> file:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>$ scalpel -c /home/unigeek/Desktop/scalpel-android.conf /home/unigeek/Desktop/userdata.dd -o /home/unigeek/Desktop/rohit</strong></pre>
<p style="padding-left: 60px"><span>Once this command is run, the tool starts to carve the files and build them accordingly as shown in the following screenshot:</span></p>

<div class="packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">Running the Scalpel tool on a dd file</div>
<ol start="4">
<li>The <kbd>output</kbd> folder that was specified in the preceding command now contains lists of folders that are based on the file types, as shown in the following screenshot. Each of these folders contains data that is based on the folder name. For instance, <kbd>jpg 2-0</kbd> contains files related to the <kbd>.jpg</kbd> extension that have been recovered:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/b0debf76-fb4c-4bbd-aacb-61d273c26730.png" style="width:30.17em;height:10.17em;"/></p>
<div class="packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">Output folder after running the Scalpel tool</div>
<ol start="5">
<li>As shown in the preceding screenshot, each folder contains recovered data from the Android device, such as images, PDF files, ZIP files, and more. While some pictures are recovered completely, some are not recovered fully, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/478b1fcc-46d1-4250-8609-a88ece1a76b7.png"/></p>
<div class="packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">Recovered data using the Scalpel tool</div>
<p>Applications such as <strong>DiskDigger</strong> can be installed on Android devices to recover different types of files from both the internal memory and SD cards. DiskDigger includes support for JPG files, MP3 and WAV audio, MP4 and 3GP video, raw camera formats, Microsoft Office files (DOC, XLS, and PPT), and more. However, as mentioned earlier, the application requires root privileges on the Android device to recover the content from the internal memory. These changes should be clearly documented by you. The <span>DiskDigger Android app operates in two different modes, basic scan mode and full scan mode.</span></p>
<p><span>The full scan mode works only on rooted devices, whereas the basic scan mode works on any device.</span> As shown in the following screenshot, on a rooted phone, the app automatically locates and displays the available partitions:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/dbc0b996-23c3-4b2e-8733-34ff4a2ba878.png" style="width:20.08em;height:33.08em;"/></p>
<div class="packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">The DiskDigger app </div>
<p>After you select the memory partition, the tool now prompts you to select the types of files that you would like to recover. Proceed by selecting the file types of interest:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/8ea75d5e-d4be-4683-a3a5-611fc544acb1.png" style="width:19.58em;height:34.83em;"/></p>
<div class="packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">The DiskDigger app file selection screen</div>
<p>Once the scanning begins, the DiskDigger app will automatically show you the files that are available for recovery. <span>The recovered files can be either saved to the app or to the device directly. </span>Hence, file-carving techniques play a very important role in recovering important deleted files from the device's internal memory.</p>

<p>You can also restore the contacts on the device using the Contacts app through the Google account that is configured on the device. This would work if the user of the device has previously synced their contacts using the <span class="packt_screen">Sync Settings</span> option available in Android. This option synchronizes the contacts and other details and stores them in the cloud. A forensic examiner like you with legal authority or proper consent can restore the deleted contacts if you can get access to the Google account configured on the device. Once the account is accessed, perform the following steps to restore the data:</p>
<ol>
<li>Log in to your Google Contacts app on the Android device using the configured Google account. The following example is attempt on a OnePlus 5 device running the Android Pie version.</li>
<li>Click on <span class="packt_screen">Settings</span> and then look for <span class="packt_screen">Restore</span>, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/8ca9b41a-46bc-4948-ba14-50d7b4c9b11b.png" style="width:15.17em;height:27.00em;"/></p>
<div class="packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">The Restore menu in the Contacts app</div>
<ol start="3">
<li>Click on <span class="packt_screen">Restore</span>, and the following screen will appear: </li>

<div class="packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">The Restore contacts dialog box</div>
<p>As you can see, you can restore the contact list to a previous state when the backup was taken at various points in time. You can also use the <span class="packt_screen">Undo changes</span> option under the <span class="packt_screen">Settings</span> menu to restore the contacts to any state in the past 30 days:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1121 image-border" src="assets/e817a2aa-d067-4158-b2ec-ae006e0bafb9.png" style="width:17.25em;height:28.50em;"/></p>
<div class="packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">Restore deleted contacts in Google account</div>
<p>Hence, using any one of the preceding techniques, a forensic examiner like you can attempt to easily recover deleted data. </p>

<p>In this chapter, we learned various techniques to recover deleted data from an Android device. This process depends on various factors, which heavily rely on access to the data residing in the internal memory and SD card. We saw various techniques to recover deleted data from both SD card as well as internal memory. While the recovery of deleted items from external storage, such as an SD card, is easy, the recovery of deleted items from the internal memory takes considerable effort. We have also learned SQLite file-parsing and file-carving techniques, using which deleted data can be extracted from an Android device. With this knowledge, you can now perform data recovery during a forensic investigation. </p>
<p>The next chapter discusses the forensic analysis of Android apps and malware and the reverse engineering of Android apps.</p>
