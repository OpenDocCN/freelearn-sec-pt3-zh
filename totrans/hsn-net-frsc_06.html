<p>A <strong>flow record</strong> is the metadata information about flow on the network. Consider a scenario where an infected system is talking to the attacker's system and has uploaded two documents of 5 MB each to the attacker's system. In such cases, the flow record will contain information such as the IP addresses of both the compromised host and the attacker system, port numbers, date and time, and the amount of data exchanged, which in this case would be around 10 MB.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>The systems responsible for managing, building, and processing flow records are called <strong>flow-record processing systems</strong>. An FRPS consists of the following components:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sensor</strong>: <span>Monitors the network for all the traffic flows, and generates flow records for these flows. </span></li>
<li><strong>Collector</strong>: A<span> server application that receives flow records from the sensor and stores it the drive. There can be many collectors on a network.</span></li>
<li><strong>Aggregator</strong>: U<span>sed to aggregate, sort, and manage data coming from multiple sources (collectors). </span></li>
<li><strong>Analyzer</strong>: <span>Analyzes the bits and bytes of data, and produces meaningful information that reveals a wide variety of problems.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Sensors are responsible for creating flow records. A sensor can vary from type to type. Network-based sensors are mainly switches and other network equipment that support flow-record generation and export. Equipment, such as Cisco switches, generates flow records in the IPFIX format, while other devices may use the NetFlow and sFlow formats. Hardware-based standalone appliances may also be used if the existing infra does not support NetFlow's record and export features.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Now that we've understood flow records and FRPS, let's begin to explore NetFlow. Consider a forensic scenario where we have captured 100 GB of full-packet PCAP files. Such large PCAP files are not easily portable and workable. This is where we turn to NetFlow. It removes the payload part of the packet and harvests only the header details.</p>
<p>In the previous chapters, we learned to work with various headers, such as IPV4, TCP, and UDP. Removing the payload so we are only left with headers would convert our 100 gigs of PCAPs into a workable 600-700 MB.</p>
<p>NetFlow has a variety of headers, such as the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Source IP</li>
<li>Destination IP</li>
<li>Source port</li>
<li>Destination port</li>
<li>Protocol</li>
<li>TCP flags</li>
<li>Time</li>
<li>Bytes info</li>
<li>Packet info</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, we can say that it can be used as a replacement for full-packet capture. However, we cannot depend on it for intelligent analysis, which requires a full-packet capture. NetFlow can be thought of as a phone bill where we see who called but cannot retrieve the conversation. NetFlow has ten versions, v1 to v10. However, the widely-used ones are v5 and v10 (IPFIX), which we will discuss in more detail.</p>

<p>Another simple concept is <strong>uniflow</strong> and <strong>bitflow</strong>. Consider a scenario where system 1 has sent 500 bytes to system 2 and system 2 responded with 3500 bytes of data. In uniflow, this would be viewed as two separate entities, while in bitflow it would be considered a single bidirectional entity with transfers of 4,000 bytes. This can be viewed as follows:</p>
<table border="1" style="border-collapse: collapse;width: 100%">

<p>The first two entries represent uniflow, while the last one represents bitflow. Meanwhile, uniflow provides much more information than bitflow, since you can tell how much data was sent/received from each endpoint</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>We just looked at uniflow and bitflow. Let's discuss the FRP deployment and architectures followed for smooth network analysis. Generally, the FRP components are connected to a network in the setup shown in the following diagram:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/9adce81e-89ec-4431-b19b-fb9cafa1f18a.png" style="width:36.00em;height:25.25em;"/></div>
<p>The preceding diagram highlights the sensor deployment in a network where the sensor is a part of the router, and through a dedicated channel, it transports logs to the collector from where they are stored to the storage units. The storage units are further connected to the analyzer for in-depth analysis. The architecture can vary from one type to another, such as for host-flow, perimeter, and enclave visibility.</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/284daf05-5ef3-4e3d-b4d7-d016148b7f03.png" style="width:24.08em;height:22.50em;"/></div>
<p>We will denote the FRP system through a single icon, as shown in preceding diagram. We can see that FRP is placed in between the firewall and the internal router. The setup demonstrates the usage for perimeter visibility. Similarly, enclave (switch level) visibility can be achieved by placing the sensors on most of the switches and then aggregating the records:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/54c733e4-f30d-413a-a7d3-58e43da9956a.png" style="width:24.75em;height:22.83em;"/></div>
<p>Host-flow visibility can be achieved by placing the sensor right on the endpoint itself and then aggregating the records:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/603e6306-f87c-4fbd-85c7-f3773b9daa85.png" style="width:15.67em;height:29.83em;"/></div>

<p>Many tools help to aid statistical flow analysis. The most common ones are <strong>Yet Another Flowmeter</strong> (<strong>YAF</strong>), <span><strong>System for Internet-Level Knowledge</strong> (</span><strong>SiLK</strong>), iSiLK, Argus, Wireshark, and Bro. While most of them provide a similar set of features, we will primarily be discussing YAF and SiLK being open source and <em>easily gettable</em>. We discussed IPFIX a bit in the previous section. Let's see how we can convert a PCAP file into an IPFIX-enabled format through YAF. YAF is a tool that processes packets from pcap files or live captures from network interfaces into bidirectional flows to an IPFIX-oriented file format. The output retrieved from YAF can be fed to popular tools, such as SiLK and other IPFIX-compliant tools. YAF contains two primary tools, one is YAF itself, and the other is <strong>yafascii</strong>, which prints data in the ASCII format based on the IPFIX-enabled input files. YAF has other PCAP tools, such as <strong>yafMetas2Pcap</strong> and <strong>getFlowKeyHash</strong>, which we will make use of in the upcoming chapters.</p>

<p>YAF can convert PCAP files to the IPFIX format, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/5098de2f-6b9f-46c9-94c0-dc322b5398e0.png" style="width:32.50em;height:2.50em;"/></div>
<p>We can see that executing the preceding command, <kbd>yaf --in filename.pcap --out filename.yaf</kbd>, results in the generation of a new file, <kbd>Fullpack.yaf</kbd>, in the IPFIX format. YAF optionally enables us to perform application labeling, deep-packet inspection, DHCP fingerprinting, and much more.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>Since we have converted the file into the IPFIX format, let's print the contents out in ASCII format using the yafscii tool, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/97e8afd7-966c-4999-a161-9b2559fe9b8d.png" style="width:11.50em;height:2.08em;"/></div>
<p>Running the previous command will produce a text file similar to the following:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1070 image-border" src="assets/4bdd8f03-a6cd-4c76-b88b-73ea557cc8e8.png" style="width:162.50em;height:42.00em;"/></div>
<p>We can see that the data is presented in the IPFIX-printable format. Since we've covered the basics of PCAP conversion, let's try performing some analysis on the IPFIX file.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>SiLK is a collection of various tools and scripts by CERT NetSA to facilitate analysis in large and vast network setups. SiLK aids the collection, storage, and analysis of the network data, and also enables the security teams to query a variety of historical datasets. Let's perform some analysis over the file from the previous example and make use of different utilities offered by SiLK.</p>
<p>However, before we do that, we need the file under analysis to be in the SiLK format and not the flat IPFIX one. The reason we convert the file into the SiLK format rather than using the flat IPFIX one is that files in the SiLK format are more space-efficient. In the previous example, we converted the PCAP file to the IPFIX format. Let's use that converted file and convert it into the SiLK format, as follows:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/24855f59-2576-4e8e-b9f2-7800a47102e1.png" style="width:21.08em;height:2.17em;"/></div>
<p>The SiLK suite contains a <strong>rwipfix2silk</strong> tool that converts IPFIX formats to SiLK. We can see that we defined the output file using the <kbd>--silk-output</kbd> switch. Let's perform some basic file-information gathering on the <kbd>test.rw</kbd> file we just created using the <strong>rwfileinfo</strong> tool, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/3e682798-bd00-43ca-93c3-41fb4895270f.png" style="width:29.08em;height:13.00em;"/></div>
<p>The <kbd>rwfileinfo</kbd> tool prints the information, such as type, version, byte order, header length, record length, and record counts, about a SiLK flow, IPset (command-line utility for managing large list of IPs) , or a bag (data structure and a binary file format containing IPv6 address) file. Additionally, we can specify the fields to print using the <kbd>--field</kbd> switch followed by the numerically-unique prefix, for example, to print count records, we will use the number <kbd>7</kbd>, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/1e539561-017a-4dc0-8551-809b044878c7.png" style="width:34.58em;height:3.25em;"/></div>
<div class="packt_tip">To view all the unique prefixes, use the <kbd>help</kbd> command: <kbd>rwfileinfo --help</kbd>.</div>
<p>To view multiple record files, we can specify wildcards in the filename as shown in the following screenshot that issuing the <kbd>rwfileinfo *.rw –summary</kbd> <span>command </span>will print the following information:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/12635397-cd77-4da6-bc3b-cd844f0b253e.png" style="width:30.83em;height:25.17em;"/></div>
<p>Having the <kbd>--summary</kbd> switch at the end will display the cumulative analysis of the files:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/099b4ff1-22ea-43a3-aea1-12d0ef91fa6d.png" style="width:12.67em;height:3.75em;"/></div>
<p>We can see that using the <kbd>--summary</kbd> switch has given us a combined summary of the total records, number of files, and file sizes.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>We can view SiLK records using the <strong>rwcut</strong> tool:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1067 image-border" src="assets/2df04a83-0b06-40f0-bc45-b2a61db5cdf9.png" style="width:162.50em;height:31.33em;"/></div>
<p>The <kbd>--num-rec</kbd> switch allows us to view only a specific set of records, which in our case is the first five. Again, we have a variety of options with the rwcut tool as well. We can define the fields using the <kbd>--fields</kbd> switch, as follows:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/7430b7f4-b3ea-4e53-b085-fafe1199f958.png"/></div>
<p>The output from the SiLK set of tools is very flexible and can be delimited using the <kbd>--delimited</kbd> switch, as follows:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1068 image-border" src="assets/b5b30fb7-4258-4f39-84ca-98ec1473c3ce.png" style="width:162.50em;height:40.83em;"/></div>
<p>We can see that <kbd>|</kbd> is the default delimiter. However, we can define our delimiter character using the <kbd>--column-sep</kbd> switch, as shown in the preceding screenshot.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>The <strong>rwtotal</strong> tool summarizes the SiLK flow records by a specified key and prints data matching the key. Consider a scenario where we need to count the data flowing to the specific ports of the systems in a network, and we can use rwtotal with the <kbd>--dport</kbd> switch as the key:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/374993ac-700b-4954-ad00-e6b4375c962e.png" style="width:50.00em;height:42.08em;"/></div>
<p>We can see that the data traveled massively to port <kbd>80</kbd>. The <kbd>--skip-zero</kbd> switch eliminates the entries with zero records. Additionally, since SiLK is used in large networks, summarizing the data flows from a particular VLAN, or a subnet, becomes extremely easy using <kbd>--sip-first-16</kbd> and its other related options, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/d2dc14e9-1b90-4221-9a29-a4a63564550f.png" style="width:47.75em;height:26.83em;"/></div>
<p>We can see that using the first 24 in the source IP address; we have four entries for <kbd>91.189</kbd> range having <kbd>1</kbd>, <kbd>2</kbd>, <kbd>30</kbd>, and <kbd>1</kbd> records, respectively. However, if we only choose to view the first 16, the stats get clobbered and we get <kbd>34</kbd> records from that specific range. This becomes extremely handy in dealing with large network setups. Similar to rwtotal, <strong>rwuniq</strong> summarizes the records with the <kbd>--field</kbd> switch, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/171a386c-194b-49b7-9d53-44af1672f8d4.png"/></div>
<p>The rwtotal tool is generally faster than the rwuniq tool but has less functionality. The <strong>rwstats</strong> tool summarizes flow records by specified fields into bins, and for each of the bins, it computes specific values and then displays the top and bottom <em>N</em> number of values based on the primary value; let's see an example:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/a823a766-94b8-48ef-95a0-a3dfb520ea19.png" style="width:38.75em;height:44.17em;"/></div>
<p>We can see that we used overall stats in the preceding screenshot and we have stats related to bytes, packets, and bytes per packet. The stats show vitals related to intervals, counts, the percentile of input, and various other details. Let's see a better example where it will eventually make a lot of sense:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/b62095f1-df94-40cd-bf9b-85f325afeae3.png"/></div>
<p>In the preceding screenshot, we have filtered the top-20 source/destination pairs based on the number of  packets and chosen to display fields 1 and 2, that is, source IP and destination IP, with packets as the value. We can immediately see that the first entry on the output has the highest packet transfer, which makes up 19.72% of the total flows from the capture.</p>
<p>Figuring out the top-10 sources and destination ports is an easy job as well:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/f6895233-d631-4ce2-9ab9-f57b3a6c6a9b.png"/></div>
<p>We can see that port <kbd>80</kbd> is one of the highest originating ports, making up 20.46% of the total packets, while port <kbd>56446</kbd> is the biggest receiving port, receiving 14.76% of the total packets. We can also set threshold values as the percentage using the <kbd>--percentage</kbd> switch, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/d3c95d97-1518-4891-bc23-8355b0400256.png"/></div>
<p>We now have the values based on the percentile. The <strong>rwcount</strong> tool allows us to break the records into time intervals. Say we want to view the total number of packets flowing every two minutes, we can issue the <kbd>rwcount</kbd> command with the <kbd>--bin-size</kbd> switch having the seconds as the parameter as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/a06752d8-ca47-4a94-bf48-afa0095109d2.png" style="width:38.42em;height:14.75em;"/></div>
<p>We can now see records for every two-minute activity and can deduce that the traffic spiked between 14:00 and 14:06 hrs. In a large setup, the preceding tool proves to be extremely handy in pinpointing any unusual spikes at random times of the day.</p>
<p><strong>rwfilter</strong> <span>–</span> what we call the S<em>wiss Army knife</em> for filtering flows <span>–</span> is one of the most popular tools in the package. Let's see an example:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1069 image-border" src="assets/2e172868-5e04-4213-92a5-2cce00e855f8.png" style="width:162.50em;height:15.58em;"/></div>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>In the preceding screenshot, we built a filter for the source, port <kbd>80</kbd>, and fed that as an input to the rwstats tool, where it displayed the source IP and number of bytes transferred and its percentage. Additionally, we set a threshold of 0.5%. Similarly, we can build filters of various kinds and feed the output of one tool as an input to the other. Let's see how we can make use of <kbd>rwscan</kbd> and <kbd>rwsort</kbd> together:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/3cd9a347-c514-4e38-a177-d40c05e3af1b.png"/></div>
<p>The rwscan tool detects scanning activities in the records, while the rwsort reads the flow records and sorts them by specified fields. We used <kbd>--scan-model=2</kbd>, which denotes a threshold random walk algorithm for portscan detection. Additionally, in the output, we can see that for the source IP addresses, we have a start time, end time, total flows, packets, and bytes transferred in the interval.</p>
<p>Well, we have now covered a small number of SiLK utilities; we will cover more in the upcoming chapters.</p>
<p>Statistical flow analysis is making the life of forensic investigators easy in terms of its portability and ease of maneuvering around the data. However, network investigations in most of the cases require full-packet captures to determine the payloads. Wireshark also provides basic flow-analysis features, such as protocol hierarchy, I/O graphs, and IPv4 and IPv6 statistics. Let's look at a few of them:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/48d9cf57-973a-449c-9b59-7981b679deef.png"/></div>
<p>Browsing to the <strong>Statistics</strong> | <strong>Protocol</strong> hierarchy, we find the detailed list of protocols and associated bytes, bits/second and the percentage of bytes as well as the count of packets. The Wireshark <strong>Statistics</strong> | <strong>IO Graph</strong> tab allows us to view the sudden rise in traffic at certain time intervals:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/28fe27c4-66cd-49e4-934e-30c5ff036351.png"/></div>
<p>Additionally, browsing to <strong>Statistics</strong> | <strong>IPv4</strong> | <strong>All Addresses</strong> will allow us to view statistics related to all the associated IP addresses, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/b9cfa71e-1f21-4407-9880-0bd1a90f41e1.png"/></div>
<p>Similarly, <strong>Statistics</strong> | <strong>IPv4</strong> | <strong>Destinations and Ports</strong> options allow us to view destinations and associated ports statistics, as follows:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/2070dceb-55c3-4066-99ce-93678408fd98.png"/></div>
<p>We can see that we can gather quick knowledge of the most transmitting endpoint and port used by it with ease. Similar options exist for IPv6 traffic as well. The HTTP packet-counter option from the <strong>Statistics</strong> | <strong>HTTP</strong> | <strong>Packet Counter</strong> tab allows us to quickly jot down errors in the web applications and the type of response sent by the application to the user:</p>

<p>We will use statistical analysis techniques in the upcoming chapters in a much more efficient manner. The goal of this chapter was to familiarize ourselves with the tools used in the process. We looked at YAF, SiLK, and Wireshark for statistical data analysis in the IPFIX and NetFlow formats.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, we will learn how to uncover the tunneled traffic and gain forensic value from it. We will look at a variety of techniques to decode and decrypt traffic sessions and active encryptions.</p>
