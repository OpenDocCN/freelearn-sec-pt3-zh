    <p>Each acquisition case is unlike others. Different manufacturers, hardware, and ecosystems; different versions of the mobile OS; different on-device security settings; and many other things make every case unique. In this chapter, we'll have a look at some common obstacles that may become roadblocks on the way to successful acquisition. We'll learn how to deal with some issues and understand restrictions and limitations imposed by some things specific to various platforms.</p>

      <p>Two-factor authentication is probably the best security feature since passwords were invented. Two-factor authentication goes a long way towards protecting one's accounts against being hacked. A password alone, no matter how long or secure, is no longer enough to provide sufficient protection. Social engineering, linked security breaches (<a class="ulink" href="http://blog.elcomsoft.com/2013/02/yahoo-dropbox-and-battle-net-hacked-stopping-the-chain-reaction/">http://blog.elcomsoft.com/2013/02/yahoo-dropbox-and-battle-net-hacked-stopping-the-chain-reaction/</a>), leaked passwords, and hacked mailboxes all contribute to the insecurity of password-based protection. Once the intruder gets a hold of someone's password, they can access the account without a fuss. Even worse, they can gain access to other accounts by, for example, using a hacked e-mail address to request password resets on other connected services. Two-factor authentication aims to address this problem.</p>

      <p>LinkedIn. Yahoo! Mail. Dropbox. Battle.net. IEEE. Adobe Connect. PayPal. eBay. Twitter. These are just a few recent examples of big name service providers being hacked, with literally millions of passwords leaked.</p>

      <p>The infamous celebrity photo leak (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/celebrity-4chan-shock-naked-picture-4395155">http://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/celebrity-4chan-shock-naked-picture-4395155</a>) was huge. It demonstrated how susceptible iCloud users are to remote hacks. Thousands of explicit images that celebrities captured with their iPhones were stolen straight from their iCloud accounts. Apparently, hackers were able to get passwords from celebrities' Apple ID, and gained access to the linked iCloud accounts using a copy of Elcomsoft Phone Breaker. Should Apple enforce two-factor authentication on iCloud account holders, the problem would probably occur on a much lesser scale. Even though two-factor authentication is not infallible and is susceptible to social engineering, it does require significantly greater effort to obtain a quickly expiring security code from the victim, and poses a much higher risk to an attacker.</p>

      <p>As an expert in mobile forensics, you may face similar obstacles when attempting to acquire information from the suspect's cloud account over the air.</p>

        <p>All three major mobile service providers (Apple, Google, and Microsoft) use similar approaches to two-factor authentication. The two most common approaches are online and offline.</p>

        <p>Online authentication works by approving authentication requests on a trusted device or entering a code that is pushed to the user or delivered via a text message. Offline authentication apps must be initialized with a cryptographic seed once; they will generate time-sensitive authentication codes afterwards without the need for an Internet connection.</p>

        <p>Google mostly uses offline authentication via its Google Authenticator app (or via Microsoft Authenticator on Windows Phone devices). However, push authentication was added by Google in June 2016.</p>

        <p>Apple is mostly relying on online authentication, pushing codes to trusted iOS devices, or delivering server-generated single-use codes via text messages. The ability to use time-dependent offline codes was added in iOS 9 with two-factor authentication support.</p>

        <p>Finally, Microsoft users have access to both authentication methods at the same time. Windows users verifying their Microsoft Account can choose online or offline authentication at any given time. In addition, users can set up two-step verification with an e-mail address or phone number. Microsoft will send a security code to enter on the sign-in page when the user attempts to sign in on a new device or from a new location.</p>

        <p>When using online authentication, users must approve a notification on one of their trusted devices. With this type of authentication, users don't have to enter security codes. Instead, they will be pushed a verification request to all of their trusted devices. By approving the request, they will successfully confirm their identity.</p>

        <p>Offline authentication apps are based on a different principle. They don't require an active Internet connection or mobile service. A new time-sensitive single-use code is generated every few seconds by the authenticator app. The codes are automatically generated even when the trusted device is offline.</p>

        <p>While it is generally possible to de-authorize individual trusted devices with online authentication apps, de-authorizing offline authentication is only possible for all offline authentication apps at the same time. Once a new cryptographic seed is generated, codes generated by offline authentication apps using the old seed will fail to verify.</p>

        <p>Two-factor authentication is still relatively new. As a result, some devices and some third-party applications are unable to properly authenticate accounts if two-factor authentication is enabled. If this is the case, the user will see an incorrect password error when trying to set up an account. This happens because these older apps do not support additional security codes.</p>

        <p>This issue was immediately recognized by developers of two-factor authentication schemes. A neat workaround was implemented. If a certain app or device does not support two-factor authentication, the user can create a unique app password allowing these apps to sign in and effectively bypass the second authentication step. Users can generate as many app passwords as needed. Microsoft, Apple, and Google all support app-specific passwords. Users are recommended to create new app passwords for each app or device not supporting the two-factor authentication scheme.</p>

        <p>App passwords can be revoked by the user at any time. Apps using revoked passwords will not be able to sign in or authenticate (for example, via a stored token). Interestingly, app-specific passwords will not work for web sign-ins or with each company's respective apps.</p>

        <p>A typical app password generated by Google 2FA looks like this: <code class="literal">asdg skgf dsks ezck</code> (it should be entered without spaces).</p>

        <p>Forensically, these app passwords, once extracted, can be used for effectively bypassing two-factor authentication. However, their forensic use is limited. For example, Apple does not allow downloading iCloud backups using an app password, but does allow accessing certain types of data (such as notes and messages). Microsoft does not allow accessing its backups with app passwords either. Google, on the other hand, allows limited access to certain types of data even when using an app password. Notably, app passwords can be used as a last resort when the expert has no access to the second authentication factor.</p>

        <p>Google implements consistent two-factor authentication, protecting access to all interactions with any of its services that involve the use of the user's Google Account. If two-factor authentication is enabled, users have to verify their identity as they attempt to access any of the services provided under the Google Account umbrella if they initiate access from a new device, app, or web browser. Authenticating Gmail in Internet Explorer does not automatically grant access to the same Gmail account if the user tries to open it in Chrome, and vice versa.</p>

        <p>Protected services include (but are not limited to) logging in to the Google Account, using Gmail, accessing files or documents in Google Drive, or setting up a new device (for example, an Android phone) to access Google Play services. All in all, Google's implementation of two-factor authentication is the most consistent and straightforward compared to Apple and Microsoft.</p>

        <p>Google relies mostly on offline, non-interactive two-factor authentication. An authenticator app is readily available on Android and iOS. The app can be initialized by scanning a color code displayed while the user sets up two-factor authentication. Once initialized, the app will continuously generate and display six-digit codes. The codes are valid for a short period of time (30 seconds).</p>

        <p>Technically speaking, the app implements TOTP or HOTP security tokens as defined in the RFC 6238 standard. As a result, similar two-factor authentication apps based on the same standard may be compatible with Google, generating exactly the same codes that will be valid for authenticating the account. As an example, Microsoft Authenticator, available in Windows Store for the Windows Phone platform, is fully compatible with both Microsoft's and Google's two-factor authentication schemes, and can be used to authenticate both types of accounts.</p>

        <p>Offline authentication in general is convenient because it does not require an active Internet connection. However, since it serves for authenticating account access (which is inherently an online operation), this point is moot. The drawback of this type of authentication is that the user cannot de-authorize an individual device or app that was previously authorized to generate authentication codes. Instead, if the user needs to de-authorize an app on any one of their devices, a new initialization image must be generated and used to re-initialize all authenticator apps running on all devices.</p>

        <p>Since an initialized authentication app may not always be available, Google offers two backup options for receiving authentication codes. The user can authorize one or several phone numbers to receive single-time codes as text messages (SMS). In addition, the user can print 10 pre-generated eight-digit backup codes. These codes do not expire. These codes are disposable; each code can be used only once. If all codes are used, or if the user loses them, a different bunch of backup codes can be generated (which automatically invalidates all unused codes from the previous batch) at <a class="ulink" href="https://www.google.com/landing/2step/">https://www.google.com/landing/2step/</a> .</p>

        <p>In the world of Microsoft Windows, the company protects Microsoft Account login with several security measures. Microsoft uses the same 2FA configuration for restoring Windows 8, 8.1, Windows 10, Windows Phone 8.1, and Windows 10 Mobile. The number of systems running one of those operating systems is huge, so it's important to understand the implications of Microsoft two-factor authentication.</p>

        <p>Why should forensic experts be concerned about two-factor authentication in Microsoft systems? At the very least, two-factor authentication protects access to online backups made by all compatible systems listed previously. These backups contain comprehensive information about the user including bits such as stored Internet Explorer and Edge browser passwords, application data, contacts, calls, and text messages. While the amount of data available in Microsoft backups is somewhat less than that captured by Apple iOS, it is still much more than available in Android backups (even in the latest Android 6.0.1).</p>

        <p>When setting up a new Windows 8, 8.1, or Windows 10 PC and attempting to sign in with a Microsoft Account (as opposed to using a local login), the system may prompt you to complete identity verification. The user's identity can be verified by either approving the verification request on a trusted device or by entering a code generated by the Authenticator app. The verification request can be pushed to an authorized Microsoft Account app running on a trusted PC or mobile device (an Android version of the app is available). Once the request is approved with an app, the new device is added to the list of trusted devices.</p>

        <p>The Windows Phone 8 and 8.1 platforms use an offline Microsoft Authenticator app that works similarly to Google Authenticator (generating time-sensitive single-use codes). The difference between the two types of authentication is that the former requires an active Internet connection to receive authentication requests, while the latter works completely offline. Both authentication methods can be active at the same time.</p>

        <p>The different authentication types may not be available on all platforms. Microsoft has compiled a comprehensive FAQ on how to configure authentication apps on the different mobile platforms.</p>

        <p>Up until recently, Apple used its very own approach to multi-factor authentication. Dubbed as two-step verification (<a class="ulink" href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204152">https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204152</a>), the extra security layer was only meant to cover certain activities that could be performed with the user's Apple ID. Namely, two-step verification covered (and still covers, if you're dealing with iOS older than 9.0) all of the following activities:</p>

        <div class="orderedlist">

          <ol class="orderedlist arabic">

        <p>With iOS 9, Apple moved from this proprietary scheme to a different method: the more open two-factor authentication.</p>

        <p>Since iOS 9, Apple switched from two-step verification to a different, improved security mechanism. Apple's two-factor authentication is built directly into iOS 9, designed to protect access to all the photos, documents, and other important data stored with Apple.</p>

        <p>Two-factor authentication is being gradually rolled out by Apple to eligible users since fall 2015 (<a class="ulink" href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205075">https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205075</a>). Unlike the older two-step verification, the new two-factor authentication mechanism protects iOS devices from the ground up. If two-factor authentication is enabled, users will be required to enter a unique, single-use six-digit authentication code every time they access their Apple ID from a new device. The code is displayed automatically on the user's other devices, or sent to a trusted (and verified) phone number (<a class="ulink" href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204915">https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204915</a>).</p>

        <p>The code is only requested once per device. It remains valid until the user signs out completely, erases the device, or changes the password. Web sign-ins can be remembered by offering the user an option to trust the browser.</p>

        <p>When it comes to digital forensics, the secondary authentication factor may or may not be available. If the secondary authentication factor is a trusted iOS device, being able to unlock the device (by entering the correct passcode) is required in order to access the pushed authentication code. Such access may or may not be available to the investigator.</p>

        <p>When performing cloud acquisition of Apple accounts protected with either two-step verification or two-factor authentication, investigators have the ability to bypass authentication requirements by using a cached authentication token. The authentication token is a piece of cached data that helps authenticate requests to Apple servers without requiring the user to enter their credentials every time.</p>

        <p>At this time, only authentication tokens produced by Apple iTunes can be used to bypass authentication.</p>

        <p>Comprehensive information on how to acquire and use binary authentication tokens to access the user's iCloud and iCloud Drive data is available in our blog:</p>

          </div>

        </div>

        <p>Two-factor authentication goes a long way towards securing user accounts. Even if a weak password is used, third parties may not be able to access information protected with two-factor authentication if they don't have physical access to the secondary authentication factor.</p>

        <p>Two-factor authentication is a roadblock to performing over-the-air acquisition. Since acquisition is normally performed on what's considered to be a new device, the authentication system will require verifying a user's identity with the second factor. As such, tools such as Elcomsoft Cloud Explorer will require entering the correct authentication code.</p>

        <p>There are exceptions. For example, Apple's authentication tokens can be extracted from a previously authorized computer and used with a tool such as Elcomsoft Phone Breaker. This allows accessing information stored in the user's iCloud, including iOS backups and uploaded files, even without having a trusted device.</p>

    <p>While we cover the issue of unallocated space separately for each individual mobile platform, this chapter gathers all information we have about the issue in a single place. In order to allow our readers to use this chapter as a reference, we included some information about internal (eMMC) and external (SD card) storage, as well as some basic information about encryption and its effect on unallocated space. We separately reviewed encryption options available for internal and external storage, as their effect on unallocated space can be quite different. If you just want an idea on whether or not unallocated space can be recovered from a particular device, carry on reading!</p>

      <p>What happens to information that was deleted from a smartphone? Is there life after a full factory reset? Is there anything left on the device after a remote wipe? What is the best method to recover information stored in unallocated space; what tools and equipment are required? With six major mobile platforms and countless variations, there is no single answer to any of those questions. Let's look at the issue from the very beginning.</p>

    <p>At this time, we have several distinctly different mobile platforms: Apple iOS, Android, Windows Phone 8, Windows RT, Windows 8/8.1/10, and BlackBerry 10. To say that these platforms handle deleted data differently is not saying much at all. Android and iOS are poles apart when it comes to handling deleted data and recovering information. Windows Phone 8 is somewhere in between, while Windows RT and the full versions of Windows 8/8.1/10 have their own share of issues.</p>

      </div>

      <p>This chapter is easy to write. Recovering data stored in unallocated space in iOS 5 and newer is impossible, even on jailbroken devices. Not even if you send it to Apple, and not if you give them the passcode. Once the data is gone, it's gone. A factory reset erases everything completely and irrecoverably.</p>

      <p>A theoretical concept exists allowing you to restore the state of the filesystem to a certain moment in the past. A proof-of-concept tool was developed, but it never made it to a truly usable state.</p>

      <p>The reason for this is how Apple implements encryption. Since iOS 5, Apple used full disk encryption in iOS devices. The decryption keys are only maintained for the file system (allocated data blocks). iOS immediately discards decryption keys for unallocated (released) data blocks. This means that once a file is deleted, decryption keys to those encrypted data blocks are destroyed.</p>

      <p>You may be able to extract the complete disk image. You may be able to extract decryption keys. But you still won't be able to decrypt unallocated areas because there will be no decryption keys for those data blocks. While the actual (encrypted) data may still be there, there is absolutely no possibility to decrypt it.</p>

      <p>Since no Apple device uses external storage (SD cards), there is no way to recover information from SD cards either.</p>

      <p>What about <span class="emphasis"><em>data recovery</em></span> tools from the Cydia repository available to users of jailbroken devices? Those are fakes. On recent iOS devices, deleted files cannot be recovered, and any tool or service offering such recovery is an imposter.</p>

      <p>Note that you may still be able to access some recently deleted files by retrieving the device's iCloud backups. Since iCloud keeps the three most recent backups, downloading the earliest backup with Elcomsoft Phone Breaker (<a class="ulink" href="https://www.elcomsoft.com/eppb.html">https://www.elcomsoft.com/eppb.html</a>) may result in finding those files before they've been deleted.</p>

      </div>

      <p>Security is the hallmark of BlackBerry smartphones. While previous versions of BlackBerry OS used to offer user-selectable security and data encryption levels, this is not the case with the newest BlackBerry 10.</p>

      <p>By design, BlackBerry 10 employs optional full-disk encryption activated by either the end user or provisioned by the corporate <span class="strong"><strong>BES</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>BlackBerry Enterprise Server</strong></span>). There is no jailbreak for BlackBerry 10. Physical acquisition methods for BlackBerry 10 devices are limited (Cellerbrite UFED via a bootloader exploits certain devices if no device password is set). There is no way to extract a decrypted raw image of an encrypted BlackBerry 10 smartphone. Chip-off acquisition will only produce an encrypted disk image; all data will remain securely encrypted. The BlackBerry security model is exemplary, and there is no way of accessing (encrypted) unallocated space data in BlackBerry 10 smartphones.</p>

      <p>In reality, BlackBerry 10 phones sold to end users don't come with encryption activated out-of-the-box. Since many users won't bother activating encryption (or are concerned with the slower performance of the storage subsystem after encryption), we've encountered quite a few BlackBerry 10 smartphones that were not encrypted.</p>

      <p>As there is no physical acquisition and no JTAG extraction available on newer BlackBerry devices, chip-off is the only extraction method available for BlackBerry 10 devices. There is no known way to determine if a particular BlackBerry is encrypted or not. As a result, the encryption status of a particular BlackBerry 10 phone has to be decided on a case by case basis.</p>

        </div>

        <p>Some BlackBerry 10 devices can use SD cards for additional storage. Those SD cards can be encrypted, or they can be left unencrypted. Unencrypted SD cards can be acquired in the usual way. There is nothing available to decrypt the content of encrypted SD cards though (unless you instruct the original BlackBerry 10 device to do so, which will require you to unlock it first with a passcode).</p>

        <p>Samsung devices are known to encrypt SD cards with encryption keys stored in the device's internal memory. As a result, encrypted SD cards can only be used in the same device. Windows 10 Mobile applies similar technique to encrypt SD cards.</p>

      <p>Android is a highly fragmented platform that implements many things in the opposite way to iOS. Let's have a look at what happens in Android devices when a file is deleted.</p>

      <div class="section" title="Android – built-in storage">

        <div class="titlepage">

          <div>

            </div>

          </div>

        </div>

        <p>Many Android devices can have two distinctly separate types of memory: built-in storage (typically an eMMC chip) and optional external storage (typically a micro SD card).</p>

        <p>Before Android 2.3 Gingerbread, Android smartphones commonly used plain flash chips as their main storage. A flash-friendly file system called <code class="literal">f2fs</code> was used for wear leveling. Since Android 2.3 and in all later versions, the overwhelming majority of Android smartphones use eMMC storage. Typically, the data partition is formatted with one of the Linux file systems such as <code class="literal">ext3</code> or <code class="literal">ext4</code>, but <code class="literal">f2fs</code> is also frequently encountered. In the past, the YAFFS2 file system was also a common choice. Several Samsung models used RFS, a FAT-based file system.</p>

        <p>Note that a large number of ultra-budget Chinese smartphones are still manufactured equipped with raw NAND chips instead of eMMC flash. While chip-off acquisition would allow capturing the complete raw dump of those chips, less advanced acquisition such as physical and JTAG is often available on those devices. Such devices are relatively rare outside China.</p>

        <p>If the data partition is not encrypted, capturing a full disk image via physical acquisition, JTAG, <span class="strong"><strong>ISP</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>In-system programming</strong></span>), or chip-off will enable the investigator to perform unallocated space analysis by using a tool supporting Linux file systems. Limitations common to all eMMC storage apply (as described in the <span class="emphasis"><em>eMMC and Deleted Data</em></span> section). Note that full-disk physical acquisition may require rooting the device or using an acquisition tool that can temporarily root the device. None of these methods are able to extract overprovisioned areas from eMMC chips.</p>

        <p>Android is the exact opposite of iOS in many ways, including its approach to encryption. As opposed to Apple iOS, which employs full-disk encryption and destroys decryption keys for unused blocks, Android encryption is sector-based. As a result, if decrypting the user partition was successful, unallocated areas are automatically decrypted as well.</p>

        <p>Since Android is a highly fragmented platform, OEMs can implement various parts of the system in many different ways. Some manufacturers (for example, Samsung) are known to vary their implementations widely between devices, even changing encryption types on the same device with OTA updates. As a result, it is impossible to predict whether or not a particular encrypted partition could be extracted via physical acquisition (with or without knowing the right passcode). One thing is for certain: encryption can make low-level attacks, such as JTAG and chip-off, complicated.</p>

        </div>

        <p>Speaking of stock Android, Google implemented encryption as early as Android 3.0 Honeycomb. However, most OEMs started implementing encryption with effect from Android 4.0. Based on the Linux <code class="literal">dm-crypt</code>, first-generation encryption was easy to brute force. The second version was much tougher to break, but brute-forcing passcodes was still possible (by swapping the function to scrypt). Initial implementations of Android encryption were inherently insecure, as encryption metadata was stored alongside encrypted data.</p>

        <p>Samsung used to use stock Android encryption in its early devices. However, the company was never happy about its security, so Samsung started experimenting with its own implementations. Early implementations of Samsung proprietary encryption still kept encryption metadata openly accessible. However, with time the company learned to encrypt metadata and moved the master key into a protected area (inaccessible during chip-off).</p>

        <p>Android 5.0 implements encryption in a way that's very similar to what Samsung does. Encryption metadata is now protected with a master key which, in turn, is now stored in a protected area inaccessible to chip-off. Google had plans to enforce encryption on all devices released with Android 5.x; however, this never materialized, and device encryption remains optional on most Android 5.x devices except for the Nexus line.</p>

        <p>If you manage to pull an unprotected image of the encrypted partition (for example, via physical acquisition) or succeed in decrypting a protected image, you may be able to gain access to unallocated areas. Note that most encryption implementations also implement Trim pass-through, allowing the eMMC controller to clear (erase) data blocks that are no longer used. Such data blocks will be apparently visible as empty (zeroed) areas. However, since the Trim operation is not instant on eMMC controllers (as opposed to most SSD drives), you may still have time to analyze and recover data from those unallocated areas.</p>

          </div>

        </div>

      </div>

      <p>Since many Android devices have SD card slots, and those SD cards are rarely encrypted (see the next chapter for details), retrieving and analyzing the external SD card is an easy way of recovering information. Naturally, recovering information from an SD card is best done by removing the card and inserting it into a micro SD reader, in a write-protected manner, connected directly to the investigator's computer.</p>

      <p>Since Android is a highly fragmented platform, the many different versions of the system (as well as many vendor customizations) implement varying approaches as to what types of data can or cannot be stored on an SD card. Android has the following policies, which cannot be changed by the user without rooting the device but can be overridden by individual OEMs:</p>

      <div class="itemizedlist">

        <ul class="itemizedlist">

          <li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Android 2.3, 4.0-4.2</strong></span>: Apps are allowed to write to the external SD card. Many OEM implementations leave external SD cards unprotected. Applications can be moved to an SD card. Applications can be installed onto an SD card. Applications moved to or installed on the SD card can keep their data on that SD card.</li>

          <li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Android 4.4</strong></span>: Due to changes in security policies, only system apps have full access to the external SD card. Regular applications cannot keep data on an SD card unless they used the new <span class="strong"><strong>SAF</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>Storage Access Framework</strong></span>) API. SD cards can still be used for storing multimedia files (music and videos) or keeping information such as map data (for example, HERE Maps).</li>

          <li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Android 5.0-5.1</strong></span>: New APIs (SAF extensions) now allow full access to SD card directories and files.</li>

          <li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Android 6.0</strong></span>: Access to external storage (SD cards and OTG sticks) integrated with internal storage.</li>

        </ul>

      </div>

      <p>The different APIs were introduced in order to secure information stored on SD cards. Unlike internal partitions that are usually formatted with ext3 or ext4 (a file system with built-in permission management and access control), external SD cards are normally formatted with FAT32 (SDHC, up to and including 32 GB) or exFAT (SDXC, 64GB, and larger cards). Neither of these implement any type of permissions or access control, requiring the operating system to take full control of who can access what areas on the SD card.</p>

      <div class="note" title="Note" style="">

        <div class="inner">

          <h3 class="title" id="toc_10"><a id="note64"/>Note</h3>

          <p> <span class="strong"><strong>Note</strong></span>: 64GB (and larger) SDXC cards are formatted with exFAT out of the box. You will need an exFAT-compliant tool to recover deleted information and analyze unallocated areas on these SD cards. While you can still carve those cards with tools not supporting exFAT, such tools will not be able to tell unallocated and allocated areas apart, and provide messy results. Do check your tool's capabilities as exFAT support is not a given.</p>

        <p>Encrypted SD cards are relatively uncommon in Android phones. Stock Android didn't implement the encryption of external SD cards in any version before Android M (although SD card encryption will be part of Android M).</p>

The corresponding setting is typically located under <span class="strong"><strong>Settings</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>More</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Security</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Encrypt external SD card</strong></span> or <span class="strong"><strong>Settings</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Control</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Security</strong></span>, and can only be activated if the phone is protected with a passcode. Similar to internal storage, there is no <code class="literal">full disk</code> encryption on SD cards. Instead, only the file system is encrypted. Unallocated (empty) areas are commonly left unencrypted, which, for one, enables investigators to recover deleted information stored on SD cards prior to encryption. Samsung devices are known to encrypt SD cards with encryption keys stored in the device's internal memory. As a result, encrypted SD cards can only be used in the same device that was used to encrypt the card.</p>

            <h3 class="title" id="toc_12"><a id="note65"/>Note</h3>

            <p>Android M implements the new concept of adoptable storage, allowing us to use an external SD card or USB drive in the same manner as internal storage. This, in particular, means that the same encryption is applicable to adopted external storage as it is used to protect the internal storage. More information can be found at <a class="ulink" href="http://nelenkov.blogspot.fi/2015/06/decrypting-android-m-adopted-storage.html">http://nelenkov.blogspot.fi/2015/06/decrypting-android-m-adopted-storage.html</a> .</p>

          </div>

        </div>

        <p>A factory reset renders data stored on an encrypted SD card unusable (even if the SD card is stored separately from the device) as the encryption master key is destroyed during the reset.</p>

        </div>

      </div>

    </div>

    <p>Windows Phone is a unique system. All three other systems are Unix-based. Apple iOS is based on BSD UNIX, Google Android is based on Linux, and BlackBerry 10 is based on QNX. Windows Phone 8/8.1, on the other hand, is based on Microsoft Windows, and shares its system architecture and the file system (NTFS).</p>

    <p>Windows Phone 8/8.1 is a well-balanced operating system that learned a lot from Android and iOS. Somewhat similar to iOS, it offers the ability to create cloud backups (although these backups contain less information compared to iOS, with almost no application data being restored, save for login data). The OS features separate data space (sandbox) for each application and leaves no residual garbage after removing an app. However, it allows access to shared files (for example, music and videos can be played by any supported application and not just that one app the user imported the data to), which is similar to Android. Just like iOS, Windows Phone does not normally allow installing applications from sources other than Windows Store.</p>

    <p>Windows Phone devices can be officially developer-unlocked to allow installing a limited number of unsigned applications from third-party sources. However, unlike in Android, there is no way for a user-installable app to obtain administrative access. Since Windows Phone devices cannot be rooted or jailbroken, there is no way to install an executable file with administrative-level access either.</p>

    <p>As a result, it is impossible to develop a user-level application to launch on the phone in order to gain access to unallocated space. The issue is the result of both insufficient privileges and missing low-level disk access APIs.</p>

    <p>Windows Phone 8/8.1 devices sold to end users don't come with pre-activated encryption. Unlike in Android, users cannot manually activate encryption on their devices, and there is no encryption option available anywhere in the settings. This allows using JTAG and chip-off acquisition methods to extract the device's full disk image. In addition, acquisition methods exist that allow reading the eMMC chip directly without removing it from the circuit board. Limitations common to all eMMC storage will apply (as described in the <span class="emphasis"><em>eMMC and Deleted Data</em></span> section). Windows 10 Mobile changed this behavior and allows full user control over encryption (and decryption) of the device.</p>

    <p>Some Windows Phone 8 devices of fairly recent generations (for example, Nokia Lumia 520) can be acquired via physical acquisition by exploiting a bootloader hack. Cellerbrite offers a tool (<span class="strong"><strong>UFED</strong></span>) that can perform physical acquisitions of selected Windows Phones. Images acquired via this method (if the device is not encrypted) will contain full, raw dumps of the phone's storage including unallocated areas.</p>

      <p>In general, the Windows Phone OS (versions 8 and 8.1, as well as Windows 10 Mobile) supports using BitLocker technology to encrypt user data. The technology effectively protects information (including unallocated areas) against hardware attacks such as JTAG and chip-off extraction.</p>

      <p>In Windows Phone 8 and 8.1, end users have no control over device encryption. There is no option to activate or deactivate encryption anywhere in the phone settings.</p>

      <p>In Windows 10 Mobile, Microsoft added a user-accessible Device Encryption setting. Interestingly, Microsoft allows both enabling and disabling encryption, allowing investigators to actually decrypt encrypted devices with a simple change of a setting. Needless to say, any data stored in unallocated space is <span class="strong"><strong>permanently lost</strong></span> during the decryption process.</p>

      <p>Windows Phone devices used in corporate environments will normally have BitLocker encryption activated out of the box, according to Microsoft (<a class="ulink" href="https://dev.windowsphone.com/en-US/OEM/docs/Phone_Bring-Up/Secure_boot_and_device_encryption_overview">https://dev.windowsphone.com/en-US/OEM/docs/Phone_Bring-Up/Secure_boot_and_device_encryption_overview</a>). Device encryption is not enabled by default. Device encryption is automatically enabled in the following scenarios:</p>

      <div class="itemizedlist">

        <ul class="itemizedlist">

          <li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The user adds an Outlook account to the phone, and the Microsoft Exchange server that it connects to is configured to require device encryption</li>

          <li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The user connects the phone to a company apps account, and the enterprise device management server for the account pushes down a policy to the phone that requires device encryption</li>

        </ul>

      </div>

      <p>In either of these scenarios, the phone automatically begins encrypting the main OS and internal user data store partitions after the device encryption policy change is configured on the phone. The device encryption work is throttled to minimize the impact to end users.</p>

      <p>This encryption effectively prevents capturing the full disk image via physical acquisition, and makes unallocated space analysis impossible. JTAG/chip-off acquisitions can still be done, but becomes useless.</p>

      <p>According to Microsoft, <span class="emphasis"><em>Unlike BitLocker for desktop Windows, there is no recovery key backup and no UI option for end users to enable or disable device encryption on Windows Phones.

      </div>

      <p>Many Windows Phone smartphones (with a few exceptions) have support for external storage via an SD card slot. The Windows Phone OS implements advanced support for external storage, allowing users to not only store music and videos on an SD card, but use the external storage to install applications. Unlike in Android, this functionality is standard on all Windows Phone devices equipped with an SD card slot regardless of OEM. In particular, entry-level Windows Phone devices with a limited amount of internal storage (for example, 8 GB models) are very likely to have an SD card installed, which makes acquisition easier.</p>

      <p>Windows Phone offers no separate options to encrypt the content of SD cards. Instead, SD card encryption is triggered by the same corporate policy provisioned to the phone, meaning that most end user devices will remain completely unencrypted while most corporate devices will have encrypted internal partitions and activated encryption for SD cards.</p>

      <p>Even if the security policy provisioned to the device demands SD card encryption, user files such as photos and videos will remain unencrypted as per Microsoft policy.</p>

      <p>More information on SD card encryption in Windows Phone 8.1 is available in <a class="link" href="ch08.html" title="Chapter 8. Acquisition – Approaching Windows 8, 8.1, 10, and RT Tablets">Chapter 8</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Acquisition - Approaching Windows 8, 8.1, 10, and RT Tablets</em></span>.</p>

      </div>

    </div>

    <p>Since Windows RT is a closed platform that does not allow running unsigned desktop applications, acquisition options other than sending the device to the manufacturer (accompanied with a government request) are limited.</p>

    <p>Since most Windows RT devices (as well as many tablets running Windows 8/8.1/10) are properly equipped for BitLocker drive encryption, the chance of encountering a device with an encrypted system partition is higher. (To recoup, BitLocker full disk protection is activated automatically by default, without user intervention, if the device is equipped with a TPM module, has non-removable (soldered) RAM, and the user logs in with their Microsoft Account as opposed to using a local Windows account.) More on BitLocker protection in <span class="strong"><strong>BITLOCKER DEVICE ENCRYPTION</strong></span>. Note that BitLocker Recovery Keys can be obtained from Microsoft with a government request.</p>

    <p>BitLocker encryption is volume-based. On eMMC and SSD drives, BitLocker provides trim pass-through, and does not encrypt unallocated space. Released data blocks will remain encrypted until they are trimmed by the SSD or eMMC controller.</p>

    <p>If BitLocker encryption is not activated, the usual acquisition techniques, and all considerations applicable to eMMC in general, will apply. However, Windows RT acquisition may be tricky, with chip-off extraction possibly being the best possible course of action.</p>

    <p>Most Windows RT devices (and practically all Windows 8/8.1 tablets) support SD cards. While Windows RT can access (and decrypt) SD cards with BitLocker To Go, the system does not come with tools to encrypt the SD card. (Users can still encrypt their SD card with a password on a different PC running the full version of Windows 8/8.1/10, and use that card, encrypted, with Windows RT.) As a result, you will most likely see an unencrypted SD card. Since many Windows and Windows RT devices are equipped with barely enough storage to keep Windows installation as well as Metro apps (32 GB is barely enough for that purpose), it is very likely that the user will have a micro SD card installed.</p>

    <p>Note that in <span class="emphasis"><em>full</em></span> (non-RT) versions of Windows, BitLocker To Go is only supported in the Pro and Enterprise editions of Windows 8 and 8.1.</p>

    <p>Also note that Windows RT and Windows 8/8.1/10 maintain a OneDrive backup of the user's documents (if the user is logged in with their Microsoft Account), and a full application backup (with app data) is maintained in the user's Microsoft Account. Providing that the user's Microsoft Account login and password are known, examiners can extract information from the cloud. Alternatively, a government request can be sent to Microsoft to obtain information they have including all BitLocker Recovery Keys stored in the cloud.</p>

        </div>

      </div>

    </div>

    <p>One of the few things that all mobile devices have in common is the choice of the type of internal storage. All Apple smartphones and tablets, most Android devices since Android 2.3 Gingerbread, all BlackBerry 10 smartphones, Windows Phone 8, Windows RT, and a lot of Windows 8/8.1 tablets use eMMC chips as their storage.</p>

    <p> <span class="strong"><strong>eMMC</strong></span> stands for <span class="strong"><strong>embedded MMC</strong></span>, or <span class="strong"><strong>embedded MultiMedia Card</strong></span>. To put it simply, eMMC is a non-removable memory card that is soldered onto a circuit board. Unlike <span class="emphasis"><em>plain</em></span> flash memory chips, the eMMC standard uses a combination of NAND modules and an integrated storage controller built into a single chip. It is the storage controller that makes things so different to traditional storage media when it comes to recovering deleted information.</p>

    <p>In broad general terms, the embedded storage controller takes care of all the reading and writing operations. In addition (and this is the important part), the eMMC specification defines a number of maintenance routines designed to maintain performance and keep flash memory in good health in a way that's very similar to how SSD drives perform.</p>

    <div class="section" title="eMMC and SSD – similarities">

      <div class="titlepage">

        <div>

          <div>

            <h2 class="title" id="toc_1"><a id="ch10lvl2sec130"/>eMMC and SSD – similarities</h2>

          </div>

        </div>

      </div>

      <p>Technically speaking, eMMC memory is similar to SSD drives in that it relies on solid-state NAND flash chips to store data, and uses an integrated controller to perform read, writes, and all maintenance operations.</p>

      <p>NAND flash chips used in both eMMC and SSD drives have two inherent properties:</p>

      <div class="itemizedlist">

        <ul class="itemizedlist">

          <li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Solid-state storage based on NAND flash chips can only write data to an empty block. If the block contains information, it must be erased before it can accept new data. Erasing a non-empty block is much slower compared to writing into an empty one. These properties are shared between eMMC and SSD drives because they use underlying physical media of the same type.</li>

          <li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">NAND flash chips have a limited lifespan. Each cell can only sustain a finite number of writes. Every time new data is written to a cell, the cell starts leaking slightly more current than before. After a certain number of write cycles, the leak will become significant enough to severely affect the ability of the cell to retain data. Most manufacturers rate their flash cells to a certain number of write operations, assuming three-month data retention while powered off.</li>

        </ul>

      </div>

      <p>Because of the underlying technology, the eMMC standard defines performance optimization and wear leveling measures similar to those used in SSD drives. Overprovisioning, instant remapping, wear leveling, trim, and background garbage collection are properties of both eMMC and SSD drives. This, in turn, means that we'll observe issues with eMMC media self-destructing evidence as a result of those background processes.</p>

      <p>However, despite similarities, eMMC and SSD drives implement those technologies differently, still retaining remnants of information even after it's been deleted.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="section" title="eMMC and SSD – differences">

      <div class="titlepage">

            <h2 class="title" id="toc_2"><a id="ch10lvl2sec131"/>eMMC and SSD – differences</h2>

          </div>

        </div>

      </div>

      <p>The main technical difference between eMMC memory and SSD drive is not the type, but the number of NAND flash chips used. SSD drives are so much faster compared to eMMC, not because they employ special types of ultra-fast flash memory (yet, in general, manufacturers tend to pick higher-quality chips for SSD drives compared to eMMC modules). Instead, SSD drives are equipped with multiple flash chips working in parallel. As a result, their controllers have the ability to read and write data from (or to) several flash cells at the same time. This ability dramatically increases SSD performance compared to single-chip solutions.</p>

      <p>As we can see, SSD drives are equipped with faster, smarter, and much more complex controllers. These controllers are also much larger, taking more space and consuming more energy. eMMC chips are built for different requirements. Used in portable, battery-powered devices, they must be small and power-efficient. As a result, not only are they not equipped with parallel operations, but they employ simplified versions of some of the maintenance algorithms used in SSD drives. This includes:</p>

      <div class="itemizedlist">

        <ul class="itemizedlist">

          <li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Unlike SSD drives, eMMC controllers may not start erasing trimmed data immediately. In many cases, deleted data may remain intact even after the trim command has been issued. For example, many Android phones will only trim data upon shutdown. For the purpose of forensic extraction, this means that eMMC chips may maintain deleted data for longer than SSD drives.</li>

          <li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Unlike SSD drives, the eMMC standard does not define a deterministic trim. Used in SSD drives, <span class="strong"><strong>DRAT</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>Deterministic Read After Trim</strong></span>) defines that the controller will return the same data for all trimmed blocks. Its extended version <span class="strong"><strong>DZAT</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>Deterministic Zero After Trim</strong></span>) means that the SSD controller will return all zeroes on any attempt to read trimmed blocks—even of the physical blocks that have not yet been erased. Now, eMMC controllers are NOT equipped with a deterministic trim. For that reason, the controller will return the actual content of the cell—even if it's marked as trimmed. For the purpose of mobile forensics, this means that deleted data can be stored in a recoverable state for a much longer time compared to SSD drives.</li>

    <div class="section" title="Overprovisioning and remapping">

      <div class="titlepage">

        <div>

          <div>

            <h2 class="title" id="toc_3"><a id="ch10lvl2sec132"/>Overprovisioning and remapping</h2>

          </div>

        </div>

      </div>

      <p>Of particular interest are overprovisioning (the fact that a memory chip has more physical storage than advertised to the outside world) and remapping (the ability of the embedded controller to instantly reassign logical addresses to different physical blocks).</p>

      <p>Overprovisioning is used by manufacturers as a means to increase write performance and the effective lifespan of the flash storage. The controller can instantly push a logical data block out of service and into the overprovisioned area, where that block will be erased and prepared for future service. Importantly, overprovisioned data blocks are non-addressable and not accessible by any means except by the controller. There is no way to extract data blocks from the overprovisioned area by any logical or physical means. JTAG and chip-off acquisition methods will <span class="emphasis"><em>only</em></span> return addressable space because they work through the eMMC controller (instead of accessing the NAND flash chips directly). The possibility of reading data directly off NAND chips is more of a theoretical one. It can be done, but at great expense and requiring extremely complex hardware.</p>

      <p>Overprovisioned data blocks in eMMC chips are not accessible to any data recovery program or app. They will not become part of a raw image or dump. Overprovisioned areas remain invisible during JTAG and chip-off acquisition because JTAG and chip-off requests are served by the controller integrated into the eMMC chip (as opposed to directly accessing NAND flash chips). If the device is equipped with plain flash chips, JTAG, using the Boundary Scan technique or chip-off acquisition, will return the entire content of those chips complete with overprovisioned areas.</p>

      <p>Overprovisioned blocks can be pulled to service by the controller integrated into the eMMC chip. The controller can instantly assign a logical address to any healthy physical block, including overprovisioned blocks. This, in turn, can mean that data block(s) belonging to a deleted file can be instantly pushed into the overprovisioned area by means of data remapping, while an already erased physical block will correspond to the logical address that used to belong to a deleted file.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="section" title="User data in overprovisioned areas">

      <div class="titlepage">

        <div>

          <div>

            <h2 class="title" id="toc_4"><a id="ch10lvl2sec133"/>User data in overprovisioned areas</h2>

          </div>

        </div>

      </div>

      <p>We've been asked this question: <span class="emphasis"><em>Have you determined if any user data is also found in this space? Is this like the bad sectors on the older NAND flash that may have contained older-dated user data that could only be obtained through chip-off? Or does the eMMC Controller allow user data to be stored there and one requires a process to gain access to these areas using chip-off, ISP, or JTAG?</em></span> </p>

      <p>It is important to understand what overprovisioned space is, and what it isn't.</p>

      <p>In the context of eMMC chips, an overprovisioned area represents a number of extra storage blocks that are not advertised as available storage capacity. These blocks don't have physical addresses that could be used by the OS to access. There is no standard way or process to gain access to them from the outside world. Only the eMMC controller embedded into the chip has access to these blocks. However, no standard mechanisms, commands, or processes are defined by the eMMC standard that could be used to make the controller dump the contents of the overprovisioned area.</p>

      <p>Overprovisioned blocks can be one of the following:</p>

      <div class="itemizedlist">

        <ul class="itemizedlist">

          <li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Bad blocks</strong></span>: Each and every eMMC chip, with no exceptions, contains a number of bad memory blocks out-of-the-factory. These are permanently mapped out. If any particular NAND block expires (reaches the maximum number of allowable write cycles) or gets bad, it can be permanently overprovisioned. Its physical address will be assigned to one of the healthy blocks from the overprovisioned area.</li>

          <li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Trimmed (erased) blocks</strong></span>: These are commonly used by the controller as quick substitutes for dirty blocks marked for trimming. If this happens, the controller maps the dirty block out of the addressable space, and assigns its address to a fresh block from the overprovisioned area.</li>

          <li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Dirty blocks</strong></span>: These blocks still contain information, waiting for their turn to be cleaned (trimmed, erased). Eventually, these blocks will be erased; however, there is no defined timeframe, so there is no way to know if a certain block will be erased at any particular time. If (or when) these blocks will be actually trimmed depends on the make and model of a particular eMMC chip, the controller used, and the current I/O load.</li>

        </ul>

      </div>

      <p>As can be seen, overprovisioned blocks may still contain user data. Due to the nature of eMMC chips, accessing the actual NAND flash modules is extremely difficult, and not possible without precise equipment.</p>

      <p>Due to the constraints of eMMC, we've never been able to access a real, raw dump of the NAND chip (as opposed to dumps obtained via chip-off). However, our experience with SSD drives (which do contain individual NAND chips that can be dumped) suggests that there can be remnants of user data scattered around in both addressable trimmed blocks as well as in the overprovisioned area.</p>

      <p>In the case of portable electronic devices, this will be actual user data as opposed to system files. In smartphones and tablets, system files are predominantly read-only and are not normally shuffled around or deleted, unless a recent OTA/firmware update was applied.</p>

      <p>To conclude this chapter, it must be said that acquiring the content of overprovisioned areas (by capturing raw physical dumps of the NAND chips) is so complicated, yet the amount of potential user data is so negligible that the process is hardly worth it, except under extreme circumstances.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="section" title="Delete operations on non-encrypted eMMC drives">

      <div class="titlepage">

        <div>

          <div>

            <h2 class="title" id="toc_5"><a id="ch10lvl2sec134"/>Delete operations on non-encrypted eMMC drives</h2>

          </div>

        </div>

      </div>

      <p>Once a file is deleted from an unencrypted eMMC volume, the operating system will make changes to the file system to indicate that certain sectors (defined on a file system level) are no longer in use. The operating system will also send the Trim command to the eMMC controller, telling the device that certain physical data blocks are no longer used. The eMMC controller then assigns the special <span class="emphasis"><em>do not care</em></span> status to those data blocks. So far, it's been pretty straightforward.</p>

      <p>What happens next depends on the particular eMMC controller and its internal programs. As we mentioned earlier, NAND flash cells can be written much faster if previously erased (they must be erased before they can be written to). As a result, the eMMC controller will do two things:</p>

      <div class="itemizedlist">

        <ul class="itemizedlist">

          <li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The controller will schedule trimmed blocks to be emptied (erased) to prepare them for accepting new data.</li>

          <li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The controller may remap those data blocks, assigning their logical addresses to already-emptied physical blocks. Those already-emptied data blocks can be taken from available (addressable) blocks, or pulled from the overprovisioned area. Such remapping has two goals: it allows the system to write new data to that logical address immediately without waiting for it to be erased (increasing effective write speeds), and allows the controller to write data to flash cells with the least number of write cycles on them (regardless of those cells' physical addresses).</li>

        </ul>

      </div>

      <p>As a result, the operating system (or any application attempting to read that particular sector) may discover that sectors belonging to a recently deleted file have become empty in an instant—much faster in fact that it takes for the flash chip to actually erase data.</p>

      <p>As a forensic expert, you may wonder what happens to those data blocks that still contain information from that deleted file. Those data blocks can be remapped to another logical address (meaning that you should be able to carve the file after taking a full dump of the eMMC chip). Alternatively, those data blocks could be pushed out of the addressable space and placed into an overprovisioned area, where the integrated controller will erase their content in the background. If those data blocks end up in the overprovisioned area, there is no feasible way of extracting their content—even if you use JTAG or chip-off extraction.</p>

      </div>

      <p>Before we start discussing the particular implementations of the different mobile platforms, we can already conclude that recovering unallocated space is going to be difficult and not always possible due to the underlying technology. The chances to retrieve information from an eMMC chip are substantially higher compared to the situation with SSD drives, but significantly lower compared to traditional hard drives or flash-based storage media without integrated controllers.</p>

      <p>In other words, there still is a chance to recover deleted data from unallocated space... if the mobile operating system does not prevent it in one way or another.</p>

    <p>Many Android phones, most Windows Phone 8, Windows RT, Windows 8/8.1 devices, and BlackBerry 10 phones are equipped with micro SD card slots to allow users to increase available storage capacity. Depending on the platform, certain limitations apply as to what types of data the users are allowed to keep on an SD card. For example, the Windows Phone 8 platform enables full, unrestricted use of an SD card including an option to install applications, while the different versions of Android implement strikingly different policies to external storage.</p>

    <p>SD cards are frequently used to store multimedia files (music and videos), Camera Roll, offline maps (for example, HERE Maps or other navigation applications), and additional data (for example, extra files belonging to larger games). In Android, not all applications are able to use external storage to keep their data.</p>

    <p>Just like eMMC chips, SD cards are a combination of NAND flash chips and an integrated microcontroller. However, the built-in storage controller is much simpler than that of an eMMC drive. SD card controllers do have address remapping (as per manufacturing limitations, each NAND chip in every SD card contains a large number of unusable, faulty blocks that are simply mapped out); however, trimming erased data in the background is not part of the Secure Digital standard. As a result, data that belongs to files deleted from an unencrypted SD card will normally remain accessible until overwritten with new information.</p>

    <p>Another thing to note is the use of the file system. micro SD cards that conform to the SDHC standard (up to and including 32 GB cards) come formatted with FAT32, while the SDXC standard requires the use of exFAT, a new file system from Microsoft that lifts the 4 GB limitation for maximum file size. Microsoft collects licensing fees for supporting exFAT. This is the reason for many Android devices only supporting SD cards up to 32 GB (more often than not, these same devices will support a 64 GB memory card if reformatted to FAT32). At the same time, even the cheapest Windows Phones support SDXC memory cards with exFAT.</p>

      <p>Many mobile platforms have the ability to encrypt the content of external storage including micro-SD cards. While encryption policies and implementations vary widely among the different ecosystems, two things are in common between all of them:</p>

      <div class="itemizedlist">

        <ul class="itemizedlist">

          <li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">SD cards are almost never encrypted out of the box. The user (or system administrator, if the device is managed by a corporate policy) must explicitly encrypt the content of an SD card.</li>

          <li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">SD card encryption is practically never full-disk encryption. This means that, when the user encrypts the SD card, only the file system is encrypted. Any free space (which may or may not contain remnants of deleted data) is left over.</li>

        </ul>

      </div>

      <p>Other than that, the following policies are observed.</p>

      <div class="section" title="Apple iOS">

        <p>Users can manually encrypt SD cards. Factory reset typically wipes the content of internal memory; the content of an external SD card is rarely wiped, although data becomes inaccessible after the wipe due to encryption metadata being destroyed. This behavior may be different due to platform fragmentation and various OEM implementations.</p>

        <p>Most implementations make encryption of multimedia files (pictures, videos, and music) on SD cards optional. This opens the possibility for carving deleted pictures and videos from the SD card.</p>

        <p>If an Android device has an SD card mounted, the system and some applications may automatically use the SD card to store information. For example, Foursquare keeps parts of its data on an SD card by default, while WhatsApp uses the SD card to create backups. HERE Maps and some other navigation tools can be configured to store maps, voices, and parts of their data on an SD card. There are many more applications that use SD cards to keep data, which enables experts to carve the content of an SD card for evidence.</p>

        <p>Since Android does not come with the ability to format SD cards with a Linux file system such as ext3 or ext4, the majority of SD cards used in Android devices are formatted with either FAT32 (SDHC, cards up to and including 32 GB) or exFAT (SDXC, 64 GB and larger SD cards). Neither file system comes with access control or permission management. This, as well as the fact that the SD card can be easily removed, made some developers employ proprietary encryption to protect files stored on an SD card by their applications. This can become an extra obstacle when analyzing unallocated space from an SD card.</p>

        <p>Windows Phone 8.1 supports the ability to install apps on an SD card. According to Microsoft documentation (<a class="ulink" href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/B/9/A/B9A00269-28D5-4ACA-9E8E-E2E722B35A7D/Windows-Phone-8-1-Security-Overview.pdf">http://download.microsoft.com/download/B/9/A/B9A00269-28D5-4ACA-9E8E-E2E722B35A7D/Windows-Phone-8-1-Security-Overview.pdf</a>), apps and their data are stored on a hidden partition on the SD card. If encryption is enabled on the device by the corresponding policy, this partition will be encrypted just like the internal storage. Notably, personal content such as photos and videos is stored on the SD card in an unencrypted partition so that the user can access the SD card on other devices. As a result, unallocated space can be carved at least for the unencrypted partition even if encryption is activated.</p>

        <p>In reality, we were unable to prove the existence of a special hidden partition on Windows Phone 8.1 devices. Installing applications onto an SD card inserted into a Windows phone provisioned to support encryption has always resulted in clearly visible files and folders being created on the main partition on that card. The entire content of these folders, complete with application binaries, their data, and temporary files, was accessible in plain view. After a system update pushed by Microsoft in late 2014, the system fixed that behavior by enabling per-file encryption. The entire file system can still be browsed through, and filenames and sizes are visible, yet the content of those files is now encrypted. This behavior is significantly different from the mechanism described in the Microsoft whitepaper. Other researchers (for example, <a class="ulink" href="http://www.insinuator.net/2015/01/in-secure-sd-cards-on-wp8-1/">http://www.insinuator.net/2015/01/in-secure-sd-cards-on-wp8-1/</a>) received similar results, so it's unlikely that our experience was an isolated incident.</p>

        <p>It is essential that Windows Phone 8.x does not allow users to encrypt their devices (or SD cards) with a setting within the phone's menu. There is no such option available. Encryption can only be activated as provisioned by the corporate security policy (if the phone is used in a corporate environment and connected to an MDM system).</p>

        <p>A factory reset may not render the SD card inaccessible since encryption escrow keys may be available in the MDM system.</p>

        <p>Windows RT supports a somewhat restricted version of BitLocker that does not allow encrypting the SD card in a Windows RT device, but does allow using an already encrypted card (for example, if one was encrypted in a computer running the full version of Windows). Considering the number of Windows RT devices sold, the chances of encountering an encrypted SD card in one of those are slim to none.</p>

        <p>Notably, a full factory reset of a Windows RT system will neither wipe the content of an SD card nor render the data inaccessible since information is encrypted with a password and can be accessed again if the correct password has been entered.</p>

      <p>While most tablets running Windows 8, 8.1, and Windows 10 support BitLocker full disk protection (for encrypting partitions in the main eMMC storage), BitLocker To Go (for encrypting external storage such as USB flash drives and SD cards with a password) is only available in the Pro and Enterprise editions of Windows 8 and 8.1 and Windows 10 Pro. Since many budget Windows tablets use the most basic edition of Windows with Bing, SD card encryption is not available to their users (yet, similar to Windows RT, they can still access BitLocker-protected SD cards that were encrypted on a higher Windows edition that supports BitLocker). Even if the SD card is encrypted, BitLocker To Go only encrypts the file system, leaving unallocated space unencrypted. (This has changed in Windows 10, with the option to encrypt the entire content of the SD card now available.)</p>

      <p>Notably, a full factory reset of a Windows system will neither wipe the content of an SD card nor render the data inaccessible since information is encrypted with a password and can be accessed again if the correct password has been entered.</p>

      <p>Early versions of BlackBerry OS offered three distinct options to encrypt SD cards:</p>

      <div class="itemizedlist">

        <ul class="itemizedlist">

          <li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Using the device key</li>

          <li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Using the device key and the password</li>

        </ul>

      </div>

      <p>With the exception of the first encryption method, passwords can be attacked and recovered, and backups can be decrypted.</p>

      <p>When it comes to SD encryption, the decryption key can be extracted from a physical image or chip-off dump of the device. Early versions of BlackBerry OS (prior to BlackBerry 10) used to have a security flaw related to encrypted SD cards. Encryption metadata could be derived by analyzing the content of the encrypted SD card and brute-forcing the security key. This weakness (used, for example, in Elcomsoft Phone Breaker) allowed investigators to decrypt encrypted partitions dumped from the device itself in addition to the content of the SD card itself. Effectively, the option to encrypt the content of an SD card became the system's Achilles heel. This, however, is no longer the case in BlackBerry 10.</p>

        <p>SD card encryption is optional in BlackBerry 10, even if the device is configured to encrypt its main memory. A factory reset destroys encryption metadata, rendering the content of such an SD card completely inaccessible.</p>

      <p>While SD cards are equipped with an integrated storage controller, the built-in controllers are of a simple variety. While supporting data remapping, SD card controllers do not implement trim, which means that deleted data will remain available in unallocated areas, just like on most USB drives. The same acquisition methods that work for USB flash drives will work for SD cards. SDHC cards (up to and including 32 GB) are typically formatted with FAT32. Do note that larger SDXC cards (64 GB and up) come pre-formatted with exFAT, and will require a carving tool supporting that file system.</p>

      <p>It is essential to note that mobile devices (smartphones and tablets) accept microSD cards as opposed to standard-size SD cards. microSD are built to different specifications compared to standard-size SD cards. In particular, microSD cards do not support the <span class="strong"><strong>flash erase</strong></span> command, meaning no background collection and no automatic wiping of released data blocks.</p>

        </div>

      </div>

    </div>

    <p>A special case (accessing deleted data on mobile platforms) applies to information stored inside SQLite databases. SQLite is a universally accepted database format employed by countless system and third-party apps running on all popular mobile platforms. Android and iOS keep call logs, message history, Web browsing logs, and many system settings in SQLite databases. Applications such as Chrome, Firefox, Skype, WhatsApp, and countless others also use SQLite.</p>

    <p>Unlike files deleted from encrypted partitions, records deleted from SQLite databases may not immediately disappear. In a naive attempt to counter forensic efforts, users may clear call history, delete message logs, and clear the browsing history. These measures may not be as effective as users think.</p>

    <p>The reason for these measures being unreliable is the way in which SQLite deletes records. Due to performance considerations, SQLite does not wipe deleted records (which can be quite big) unless flushed. Instead, the actual data is not moved anywhere. SQLite modifies pointers to deleted records to manifest that those records are now stored in a so-called <span class="strong"><strong>freelist</strong></span>. By using a forensic SQLite analysis tool (for example, Belkasoft Evidence Center or Elcomsoft Phone Viewer), one can access and parse the database container, successfully extracting deleted records from the freelist and viewing them along with existing data.</p>

    <p>Regularly cleaning call logs and removing text messages helps users maintain the illusion of privacy, while in fact deleted records may not immediately disappear. Instead, these records might be placed into a freelist. Records can be kept in the freelist for a long time—much longer in fact than most users realize because new calls and text messages that could potentially trigger a cleanup are relatively infrequent.</p>
