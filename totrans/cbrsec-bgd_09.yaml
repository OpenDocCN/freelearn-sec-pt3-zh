    many people are acquiring important skills without stepping into a classroom.
    Some organizations have opted to offer free training programs, particularly in
    the field of cybersecurity, to increase the number of professionals that can reliably
    counter cybercriminals. In addition, there are many threats that specifically
    target users in organizations. Organizations are responding to these crimes by
    enrolling employees in online classes instead of the traditional seminar to teach
    basic concepts. Learning cybersecurity skills online is highly convenient, especially
    for those aspiring to start careers in it. The eLearning space is full of incredible
    knowledge sources. There are fears that some do not offer quality training. Other
    learning platforms do not cover all the requirements of a given course. However,
    there are some learning platforms that are licensed to offer training and can
    give learners certifications to prove that they went through a recognized platform
    and met all assessment expectations, and were awarded a certificate. This chapter
    will look at the need to be certified and how to choose the right places and certifications
    to study for. It will discuss the following:'

    not to specialize fully in a certain field. However, taking a certification course
    in cybersecurity makes you stand out from the crowd. While completing a degree
    course is still valuable, you get an added advantage by having a certification
    in a certain niche. Certifications often offer skills that are highly relevant
    to specific jobs. For instance, if you take a penetration testing course, you
    get skills that are highly relevant for all security analyst jobs. Having a certification
    is, therefore, highly valuable. It shows employers that you took the initiative
    to hone your skills in a specific niche, thus you are better qualified for the
    job you are applying to.

    on paper that have poor practical skills. Degrees tend to be misleading since
    a student could have passed in the easy and less relevant courses to a job but
    failed in the most important courses. In addition, the assessments in degree programs
    tend not to be thorough. They do not expose learners to challenging situations
    where their abilities are tested to the fullest. The degree certificate will not
    reflect the strong or weak points of a candidate. On the contrary, certifications
    tend to be thorough and learners have to prove their skills in several assessments
    to be considered successful in the course. Some certifications also provide details
    about the performance of a learner in specific modules. They assure employers
    that the skills taught were assessed to the full extent and you showed competence
    in all of them. Therefore, employers will have fewer worries about onboarding
    you.

    new skill requirements, and companies will start looking for experts that have
    these skills. Degree programs tend to be slow to change, thus it is hard for universities
    to alter their courses just because of a new threat. Fortunately, certifications
    are robust and many vendors will assess the need for skills in the market and
    tailor their training accordingly. Taking some certifications early enough gives
    you the advantage of getting in-demand jobs with a good salary. Degree programs
    are not designed to give learners such rapid training to capitalize on gaps that
    arise in the market.

    Therefore, if you want to start a new career altogether, taking certifications
    will be beneficial. They will save the cost and time of going back to university

    favorite color into an online form is safe from black-market traders, unscrupulous
    governments, internet hacktivists, and whatever other threats you can possibly
    imagine. Push the question a little further, and your random person on the street
    might tell you all the things they do to stay safe online—and all the things they
    don't do. At the very least, you would probably conclude that awareness of cybersecurity
    issues has dramatically increased in the public sphere. Awareness is, to be sure,
    a crucial step in bolstering security, whether in a corporate context or a more
    personal one. But awareness is not enough.

    on the web or maybe a colleague hurriedly mentioned a few personal security tips
    on a lunch break. Maybe their employer sent out a security-minded email that the
    user didn't really take seriously. While these actions provide a decent start,
    they aren't sufficient. Superficial commentary alone won't foster an adequate

    our online presence for misuse is crucial. Unfortunately, it's easy to feel that
    your online presence is stretched thin, and that much of it is beyond your control.

    which is offered by CompTIA. It gives the individual an opportunity to gain knowledge
    about security infrastructure, identity management, risk evaluation and mitigation,
    and also a fair amount of cryptographic knowledge. This could be a good start
    for individuals working as system administrators and in IT infrastructure services.
    It might give you that overlap in transitioning from an existing role toward more
    a security-centric role. One of the best parts of this certification is that its
    vendor-neutral, which means it covers skills in general security concepts and
    is not focused toward any particular product. It is considered an entry-level
    certification by many, but it can also be useful if you have at least a few years
    of IT experience. The CompTIA Security+ certification is also approved by the
    US DoD Directive 8140/8570.01-M requirements. There are many options available
    to complete this certification, but you can also choose to do it in the self-paced

    data collected from various sources and interpret the results of your analysis
    to identify threats, risks, and vulnerabilities for your business and organization.

    from the past decade or so. I never see any decline in enthusiasm from professionals
    who want to start in cybersecurity or just want to understand the attacker's perspective
    behind any security breaches and attacks. This certification is offered by EC-Council,
    they also offer a range of other certifications for security professionals. This
    certification focuses on the *"White Hat Hacker"—*a concept that defines how you
    can use the same techniques as the bad guys to proactively find and prevent attacks.
    It teaches you how to think like an attacker, and learn how actual attacks are
    carried out and using what means. This certification also exposes you to the knowledge
    of hacking practices, such as foot-printing, reconnaissance, scanning the network
    for vulnerabilities, enumeration, and knowing the internal working mechanisms
    of Trojans, worms, and viruses. It also teaches you about how to use sniffers,
    how DoS and DDoS attacks work, and how you can use social engineering when you
    are doing a threat assessment. Apart from focusing on network-based and social
    engineering attacks, CEH brings in the concepts of web hacking, how webservers
    are attacked and what you can expect when you are preventing such an attack, and
    SQL injection attacks and how to perform them on your corporate applications to
    find vulnerabilities proactively. Last but not least, this also covers evading
    IDS, firewalls, and honeypots. This certification can be best achieved by attending
    any five-day training course, and it is highly recommended to take this as classroom-based
    so that you can gain more as a team and get the opportunity to use the lab set
    up by the trainers to give you first-hand experience.

    of one year, for candidates who have a four-year college degree or a master's
    degree. Does this mean that candidates who do not have the required experience
    cannot achieve this certification? No, even they can appear for this certification,
    but they will then be receiving Associate of (ISC)² designation once they pass
    the required CISSP examination, and that will be valid for a maximum of six years.
    Within this period of six years, you will need to obtain the required experience
    and submit it to (ISC)² for certification as a CISSP. Upon acceptance of the professional

    of information and systems. This is highly accepted globally and has become a
    de-facto standard when it comes to security-audit certifications. If you already
    conduct Information System audits, are a security professional with existing experience,
    or work as an IT consultant, Privacy Officer, or Information Security Officer,
    this might be a valuable certification to have for your experience and skills.
    A minimum of five years of information security work experience, with a minimum
    of three years of information security management work experience is necessary
    for this certification. This certificate will help you learn about five domains

    way to kickstart your security career, if you want to focus on the network security
    side of the cyber world. Cisco certifications are mainly split into four major
    categories, the first is the entry-level certification, **CCENT**, the second
    is associate certifications, which is the **CCNA** and **CCDA** range of certifications,
    the third is the professional certifications which cover the **CCNP** and **CCDP**
    range, and the last one is the expert level, which covers the **CCIE** and **CCDE**
    range. For more serious professionals who want to get deeper into network design,
    architecture, and security, Cisco certifications also cover architect certifications
    under the acronym **CCAr**. The best part of the Cisco certifications is that
    they have split each level into nine different categories to make it easy for
    you to choose the path you want to take for your career and specific technical
    field: Routing & Switching, Design, Industrial Network, Network Security, Service
    Provider, Service Provider Operations, Storage Networking, Voice, Datacenter,
    and Wireless. The split also makes sense because the network subject is huge and
    you cannot learn everything in one certification. Well, you may choose to have
    the certifications in all the nine categories, if you have enough time and resources
    (I am aware of very few people in the real world who have a series of these certifications),
    it''s just that you have to take them one by one, and gain expertise in them.
    Let''s look at some of these certifications (the rest of them can be found at

- en: This chapter focused on knowledge check, particularly related to certifications.
    There are many eLearning platforms that have opened and all offer competitive
    courses and certifications upon the successful completion of each course.

- en: Certifications will offer learners some advantages in the job market that applicants
    that only have degrees will not get. Certifications show employers that you take
    initiative, show that you are highly skilled in a certain niche, equip you with
    in-demand skills, market your skills, and can kickstart a cyber security career
    for people with non-IT degrees. Choosing the certification to take and the vendor
    must always be done with caution. Before picking a course, you should evaluate
    the vendor's reputation, the credibility of the certification, the duration of
    the course, the feedback from previous learners, the level of support that learners
    are offered, and market demand.
