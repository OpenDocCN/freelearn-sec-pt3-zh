<h1 id="_idParaDest-49"><a id="_idTextAnchor048"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.1">An overview of forensic science</span></h1>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.1">In the last 20 years, we have seen an explosion in the interest in forensic science. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.2">Simply put, forensics is </span><a id="_idIndexMarker265"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.1">the application of science to legal matters. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.2">The actual practice of forensics is to take physical and digital evidence through a process of analysis and present scientific findings in a court of law. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.3">Despite its depiction within popular media, forensic science is a detailed and exacting process, which requires well-thought-out processes and procedures, technology, and experience.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.1">Forensic science has become integral to a wide range of disciplines, even outside the purview of criminal justice. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.2">Air crash investigators use forensic techniques to investigate aircraft failures, for example. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.3">Accounts use very similar principles and techniques when conducting investigations into suspected fraud and money laundering schemes. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.4">Even the art world, known for historic fakes, employs forensic techniques to verify the authenticity of works of art.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.1">The first high-profile case where forensics played a role was in the Jack the Ripper murders in the late 1800s. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.2">Investigators in the London Metropolitan Police were able to identify, collect, and later </span><a id="_idIndexMarker266"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.1">examine physical evidence left by the unknown perpetrator. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.2">Around that time, two other tried and true forensic practices, fingerprint comparison and crime scene photography, were added to the growing body of knowledge and practices.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.1">These practices would continue to slowly build based on the available technology until after World War II. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.2">This seventy-five-year period would see the inclusion of DNA evidence as a powerful way to identify perpetrators. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.3">Technology was applied to tool marks and ballistics. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.4">It was also in the latter half of the twentieth century that digital forensics found its way into the various forensic science disciplines.</span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-50"><a id="_idTextAnchor049"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.1">Locard’s exchange principle</span></h1>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.1">A key principle that guides forensics is </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.1">Locard’s exchange principle</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.1">. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.2">Dr. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.3">Edmond Locard was a </span><a id="_idIndexMarker267"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.1">pioneer in the fields of forensics and criminalistics. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.2">His contributions to these fields led to many deeming him the Sherlock Holmes of France. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.3">His principle, simply put, is that every moment of contact with the physical world leaves a trace. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.4">For example, a burglar breaks a window to enter a home. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.5">They then crawl through this window and begin to grab the items around them. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.6">According to Locard’s exchange principle, the burglar will leave traces of dirt from their shoes on the carpet. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.7">Skin and hairs may fall away from their body onto the various surfaces of the home. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.8">Without gloves, the burglar might also leave fingerprints on the door handles.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.1">This exchange is a two-way street. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.2">As our burglar leaves traces of themself around the house, traces of the house are left on them. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.3">Carpet fibers attach to their shoes. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.4">Fragments of the broken windows may also embed themselves into the burglar’s footwear and clothing. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.5">These pieces of trace evidence can tie the burglar to the scene.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.1">This principle has been in force since the first criminal activity took place. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.2">What has changed is the ability of forensic scientists and criminalistic practitioners to detect and analyze this trace evidence. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.3">For example, DNA evidence has been around since Cain slew Abel. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.4">It is only recently that it has become useful in an investigation because methods and technologies have developed to the point that forensic scientists can definitively prove that biological material can be tied to a specific individual to the exclusion of every other human being.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.1">There are a few considerations to keep in mind about this principle. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.2">First, there is a good deal of variation in how long trace evidence can be found. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.3">For example, some trace evidence, such as tool marks that are left when a pry bar is used to force open a door, may persist for months or even years. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.4">On the other hand, fingerprints exposed to the elements are easily </span><a id="_idIndexMarker268"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.1">rendered unsuitable days or even hours after they were left. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.2">Second, certain processes that maintain the integrity of trace evidence need to be followed. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.3">If trace evidence is not collected properly, it can be altered or destroyed, making it completely unusable for investigative purposes. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.4">Third, there needs to be a corresponding technology that aids in the analysis of trace evidence. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.5">DNA has existed since the dawn of life on Earth. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.6">The ability to leverage this trace evidence for investigative purposes relies on the technology to properly compare and analyze DNA samples. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.7">Finally, the human element is also present. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.8">Trace evidence needs to be handled by trained and qualified analysts who can review the data and draw conclusions.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.1">It may seem a bit odd to be discussing Locard’s exchange principle within the field of digital forensics. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.2">The reality is that the same principle that underpins forensics in the physical world has the same applicability in digital forensics. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.3">For example, a simple connection to a system via the Microsoft Windows Remote Desktop feature leaves traces. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.4">In this case, an external threat actor has obtained valid user credentials and is able to connect through an exposed system. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.5">The connection itself would create a log entry on the exposed system. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.6">The use of valid credentials to log into the system would create a second log entry. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.7">Contained within this log entry is the IP address of the threat actor’s system. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.8">This IP address may also be contained within firewall logs. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.9">The threat actor would also have log entries and potentially files from the compromised system on their own system.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.1">What is important to understand about Locard’s exchange principle is the concept of trace evidence. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.2">Threat actors will go to great lengths to remove their tracks the same way very good criminals will but there is still a trace. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.3">The key is having the tools and ability to discover these traces and tie them back to a threat actor.</span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-51"><a id="_idTextAnchor050"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.1">Legal issues in digital forensics</span></h1>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.1">As we saw in </span><a href="B18571_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor013"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.1">Chapter 1</span></em></a><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.1">, a proper incident response involves key individuals from a variety of disciplines. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.2">This highlights one frequently held misconception: incident response is strictly a technological matter. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.3">One realm into which incident response falls heavily is the legal arena. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.4">There is a wide range of laws and regulations that directly impact an organization’s incident response capability, ranging from breach notification to privacy. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.5">These laws provide a framework for governments to prosecute offenders, as well as provide strict rules concerning topics such as how evidence is handled and presented in court.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-52"><a id="_idTextAnchor051"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.1">Law and regulations</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.1">In the mid-1980s, as </span><a id="_idIndexMarker269"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.1">computer crime started to become more prevalent, jurisdictions began crafting laws to address ever-increasing instances of cybercrime. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.2">In the United States, for example, federal criminal law has specific statutes that deal directly with criminal activity when utilizing a computer, as follows:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.1">18 USC § 1029—Fraud and related activity in connection with access devices</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.1">: This statute addresses the use of a computer to commit fraud. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.2">This is most often utilized by prosecutors in connection with cases where cybercriminals use a computer, or computers, to commit identity theft or other fraud-related activities.</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.1">18 USC § 1030—Computer Fraud and Abuse Act</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.1">CFAA</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.1">): Among the number of provisions </span><a id="_idIndexMarker270"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.1">within this law, the one most </span><a id="_idIndexMarker271"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.1">associated with incident response is that of unauthorized access to a computer system. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.2">This law also addresses the illegality of </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.1">denial-of-service</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.1">DoS</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.1">) attacks.</span></li>

</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.1">Being familiar with the ECPA is critical for those organizations that have a presence in the United States. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.2">Provisions of the law make it a crime for an organization to conduct surveillance and capture traffic on networks, even those under their control, if the users have a reasonable expectation of privacy. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.3">This can lead to an organization being held liable for sniffing traffic on its own network if, in fact, its users have a reasonable expectation of privacy. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.4">For CSIRT members, this </span><a id="_idIndexMarker274"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.1">creates potential legal problems if they access network resources or other systems. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.2">This can be easily remedied by having all system users acknowledge that they understand their communications can be monitored by the organization and that they have no reasonable expectation of privacy in their communications when using computer and network resources provided by the organization.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.1">The </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.1">Economic Espionage Act of 1996</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.1">EEA</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.1">): This law contains several provisions </span><a id="_idIndexMarker275"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.1">found in 18 USC § 1831-1839, and makes economic espionage and the theft of trade secrets a crime. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.2">This act goes further than previous espionage legislation, as it deals directly with commercial enterprises and not just national security or government information.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-53"><a id="_idTextAnchor052"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.1">Rules of evidence</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.1">Federal rules of evidence serve as the basis by which evidence can be admitted or excluded during </span><a id="_idIndexMarker276"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.1">a criminal or civil proceeding. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.2">Having knowledge of the following rules is important for CSIRT members so that any evidence collected is handled in a manner that prevents contamination and the possibility of the evidence being barred from being seen in court:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.1">Rule 402—Test for Relevant Evidence</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.1">: This rule has two parts. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.2">First, the evidence to be admitted into the proceedings must tend to make a fact more or less probable than it would be without the evidence. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.3">Second, the evidence (or the facts that the evidence proves) is of consequence to the proceedings. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.4">This makes clear that the evidence should not only be relevant to the proceedings but also it should prove or disprove a facet of the case.</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.1">Rule 502—Attorney-Client Privilege and Work Product</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.1">: One of the most sacrosanct tenets of modern law is the relationship between a client and their attorney. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.2">One of the provisions of the attorney-client privilege is that what is said between the two is not admissible in court. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.3">This applies not only to spoken communications but written communications as well. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.4">In the world of digital forensics, reports are often written concerning actions taken and information obtained. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.5">Oftentimes, incident responders will be working directly for attorneys </span><a id="_idIndexMarker277"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.1">on behalf of their clients. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.2">As a result, these reports prepared in conjunction with an incident may fall under attorney work product rules. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.3">It is important to understand this when you work under the auspices of an attorney and when these rules may apply to your work.</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.1">Rule 702—Testimony by Expert Witnesses</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.1">: Through the acquisition of experience and knowledge in digital forensics, an analyst may be allowed to testify as an expert witness. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.2">This rule of evidence outlines the specifics concerning expert witness testimony.</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.1">Rule 902—Evidence that is Self-Authenticating</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.1">: This rule has recently undergone a revision, as it relates to digital forensics. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.2">A new subpart has been added as of December 1, 2017. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.3">This new subpart permits the verification of digital evidence integrity through hashing (we will discuss the role of hashing in later chapters). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.4">Furthermore, this rule requires that a qualified person presents the evidence and that the evidence being presented has been collected according to best practices.</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.1">Rule 1002—Best Evidence Rule</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.1">: In civil or criminal proceedings, the original writings, recordings, or photographs need to be offered up as evidence, unless a reasonable exception can be made. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.2">In the physical realm, it is easy to produce physical evidence. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.3">Parties to a case can easily present a knife used in an assault. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.4">It becomes a bit more complex when the evidence is essentially magnetic polarity on a hard drive or log files that came from a router. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.5">In this case, courts have held that a forensically sound image of a hard drive is a reasonable substitute for the actual hard drive that was examined.</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.1">Rule 1003—Admissibility of Duplicates</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.1">: One of the most critical steps when conducting a forensic examination of digital media is to make an image or forensic copy of the </span><a id="_idIndexMarker278"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.1">media. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.2">This rule of evidence allows for such an image to be admitted in court. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.3">It is important to note that, if an image or forensic copy is to be admitted, the analyst who performed that action will most likely have to testify that they performed the action correctly.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.90.1">Next, we will have a look at the fundamental procedures of digital forensics as they apply to incident response.</span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-54"><a id="_idTextAnchor053"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.1">Forensic procedures in incident response</span></h1>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.92.1">As was stated in the previous chapter, digital forensics is an important component of incident response. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.92.2">It is </span><a id="_idIndexMarker279"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.1">often the application of digital forensics methods that allows incident responders to gain a clear understanding of the chain of events that led to a malicious action, such as a compromised server or other data breach. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.2">For other incidents, such as internal fraud or malicious insider activity, digital forensics may provide the proverbial smoking gun that points to the guilty party. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.3">Before a detailed examination of tools and techniques available to incident responders, it is critical to address the foundational elements of digital forensics. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.4">These elements not only provide context for specific actions but also a method to ensure that evidence made part</span><a id="_idTextAnchor054"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.1"> of an incident investigation is usable.</span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.112.1">Two other seminal events brought the need for cyber investigations and forensics into the minds of many. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.112.2">The first was hacker Markus Hess breaking into the Lawrence Berkeley National </span><a id="_idIndexMarker283"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.113.1">Laboratory. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.113.2">This break-in might have gone undetected had it not been for the efforts of Clifford Stoll, who hatched a plan to trap the attacker long enough to trace the connection. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.113.3">These efforts paid off and Stoll, along with other authorities, was able to trace the hacker and eventually prosecute him for espionage. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.113.4">(The next chapter will go into Stoll’s efforts in depth, as they not only serve as a key event indicating the need for digital forensics but his investigative techniques also provide insight.)</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.114.1">The second high-profile event was the Morris worm, which was unleashed on the fledgling internet in 1988. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.114.2">The worm, created and released by Robert Tappan Morris, caused the denial of service on several thousand systems, subsequently causing damage worth more than $100,000. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.114.3">A post-incident investigation by several individuals, including Clifford Stoll, found that at least 6,000 systems were infected. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.114.4">The rapid spread of the worm </span><a id="_idIndexMarker284"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.115.1">and the damage associated with it led to the creation of the Carnegie Mellon </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.116.1">CERT Coordination Center</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.117.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.118.1">CERT/CC</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.119.1">).</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.120.1">Throughout the 1990s, as more law enforcement agencies began to incorporate digital forensics into their investigative capabilities, the need for the standardization of forensic processes became more apparent. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.120.2">In 1993, an international conference was held to specifically address </span><a id="_idIndexMarker285"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.121.1">the role of computer evidence. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.121.2">Shortly thereafter, in 1995, the </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.122.1">International Organization on Computer Evidence</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.123.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.124.1">IOCE</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.125.1">) was formed. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.125.2">This body was created to develop guidelines and standards around the various phases of the digital forensic examination process. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.125.3">In 1998, in conjunction with the IOCE, federal crime laboratory directors created the </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.126.1">Scientific Working Group on Digital Evidence</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.127.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.128.1">SWGDE</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.129.1">). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.129.2">This group </span><a id="_idIndexMarker286"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.130.1">represented the United States component of the IOCE’s attempt to standardize digital forensics practices.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.131.1">As organizations continued to standardize practices, law enforcement agencies continued </span><a id="_idIndexMarker287"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.132.1">to incorporate digital forensics in their overall forensic capabilities. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.132.2">In 2000, the FBI established the first </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.133.1">Regional Computer Forensic Laboratory</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.134.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.135.1">RCFL</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.136.1">). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.136.2">These laboratories </span><a id="_idIndexMarker288"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.137.1">were established to serve law enforcement at various levels in a variety of cybercriminal investigations. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.137.2">The capability of the RCFL has grown over the last two decades, with 17 separate RCFLs spread across the United States. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.137.3">In addition, other federal, state, and local police agencies have formed task forces and standalone digital forensics capabilities. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.137.4">With ever-increasing instances of computer-related crime, these agencies will continue to perform their critical work.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-56"><a id="_idTextAnchor056"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.138.1">The digital forensics process</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.139.1">Much like the incident response process, the digital forensics process defines the flow of digital evidence </span><a id="_idIndexMarker289"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.140.1">related to an incident from when it is first identified to when it is presented to either senior leadership or a trier of fact, such as a civil or criminal court. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.140.2">There are several schemas that define this process and they generally follow a similar path for the </span><a id="_idIndexMarker290"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.141.1">most part. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.141.2">Here, we will be utilizing the </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.142.1">Digital Forensics Research Workshop</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.143.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.144.1">DFRWS</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.145.1">) digital investigation framework. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.145.2">This framework is depicted in the following diagram:</span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.148.1">The framework contains six elements:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.149.1">Identification </span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.150.1">Preservation </span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.151.1">Collection </span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.152.1">Examination </span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.153.1">Analysis </span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.154.1">Presentation</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.155.1">From an incident response standpoint, personnel will not normally seize network components or critical systems and take them offline unless there is a compelling reason to do so. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.155.2">This is </span><a id="_idIndexMarker291"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.156.1">one of the balancing acts inherent in digital forensics and incident response. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.156.2">A purely digital forensics approach will take all relevant evidence, secure it, and process it.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.157.1">This process can take months, depending on the type of incident. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.157.2">This approach, while thorough and detailed, can leave an organization without critical components for some time. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.157.3">The CSIRT may be able to tell the leadership which chain of events led to a breach after a month-long analysis but this would be pointless if a month’s revenue had been lost.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.158.1">The examiners </span><a id="_idIndexMarker292"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.159.1">assigned to a CSIRT must be ready to balance the need for thoroughness against the need to resume or continue normal operations.</span></p>
<h3><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.160.1">Identification</span></h3>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.161.1">Starting the digital forensic process begins with the identification of potential evidence. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.161.2">This is where the </span><a id="_idIndexMarker293"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.162.1">previously discussed Lockard’s exchange principle comes into play. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.162.2">This principle can guide the identification of potential sources of evidence during an incident. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.162.3">For example, if a CSIRT is attempting to determine the root cause of a malware infection on a system, it will start by analyzing the infected system. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.162.4">As some malware requires access to a C2 server, analysts can search firewall connections or proxy logs for any outbound traffic from the infected system to external IP addresses. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.162.5">A review of those connection IP addresses may reveal the C2 server and, potentially, more details about the specific malware variant that has infected the system.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.163.1">However, it should be noted that threat actors can very easily manipulate digital evidence, so reliance on a single piece of digital evidence without other corroborating evidence should always be treated with caution; it should be verified before it can be trusted.</span></p>
<h3><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.164.1">Preservation</span></h3>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.165.1">Once evidence is identified, it is important to safeguard it from any type of modification or deletion. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.165.2">For evidence </span><a id="_idIndexMarker294"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.166.1">such as log files, it may become necessary to enable controls that protect log files from removal or modification. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.166.2">In terms of host systems such as desktops, it may become necessary to isolate the system from the rest of the network, through either physical or logical controls, network access controls, or perimeter controls. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.166.3">It is also critical that no users are allowed to access a suspect system. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.166.4">This ensures that users do not deliberately or inadvertently taint the evidence. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.166.5">Another facet of preservation measures has been increased reliance on virtual platforms. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.166.6">Preservation of these systems can be achieved through snapshotting systems and by saving virtual machines on non-volatile storage.</span></p>
<h3><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.167.1">Collection</span></h3>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.168.1">The collection element is </span><a id="_idIndexMarker295"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.169.1">where digital forensics examiners begin the process of acquiring digital evidence. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.169.2">When examining digital evidence, it is important to understand the volatile nature of some of the evidence that an examiner will want to look at. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.169.3">Volatile </span><a id="_idIndexMarker296"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.170.1">evidence is evidence that can be lost when a system is powered down. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.170.2">For network equipment, this could include active connections or log data stored on the device. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.170.3">For laptops </span><a id="_idIndexMarker297"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.171.1">and desktops, volatile data includes running memory or the </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.172.1">Address Resolution Protocol</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.173.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.174.1">ARP</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.175.1">) cache.</span></p>

<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.189.1">Archival media</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.190.1">It is imperative that digital forensics examiners take this volatility into account when starting the process of evidence collection. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.190.2">Methods should be employed whereby volatile evidence is collected and moved to a non-volatile medium, such as an external hard drive.</span></p>
<h4><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.191.1">Proper evidence handling</span></h4>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.192.1">Proper handling and securing of evidence are critical. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.192.2">Mistakes in how evidence is acquired can lead </span><a id="_idIndexMarker299"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.193.1">to that evidence being tainted and, subsequently, not forensically sound. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.193.2">In addition, if an incident involves potential legal issues, critical </span><a id="_idIndexMarker300"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.194.1">evidence can be excluded from being admitted in a criminal or civil proceeding. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.194.2">There are several key tenets for evidence handling </span><a id="_idIndexMarker301"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.195.1">that need to be followed, as listed here:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.196.1">Altering the original evidence</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.197.1">: Actions taken by digital forensics examiners should not alter the original evidence. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.197.2">For example, forensic analysts should not access a running system if they do not have to. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.197.3">It should be noted that some of the tasks that will be explored have the potential to alter some of the evidence. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.197.4">By incorporating proper documentation and having a justifiable reason, digital forensics examiners can reduce the chance that evidence will be deemed tainted.</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.198.1">Document</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.199.1">: One central theme you will often hear in law enforcement is the phrase: </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.200.1">If you didn’t write it down, it didn’t happen</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.201.1">. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.201.2">This is especially true when discussing digital forensics. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.201.3">Every action that is taken should be documented in </span><a id="_idIndexMarker302"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.202.1">one way or another. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.202.2">This includes </span><a id="_idIndexMarker303"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.203.1">detailed notes and diagrams. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.203.2">Another way to document is through photographs. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.203.3">Proper documentation allows examiners to reconstruct the chain of events if the integrity of evidence is ever called into question.</span></li>

</ul>
<h4><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.210.1">Chain of custody</span></h4>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.211.1">Chain of custody describes the documentation of a piece of evidence through its life cycle. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.211.2">This </span><a id="_idIndexMarker305"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.212.1">life cycle begins when an individual first takes </span><a id="_idIndexMarker306"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.213.1">custody of the piece of evidence and ends when the incident is finally disposed of and the evidence can either be returned or destroyed. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.213.2">Maintaining a proper chain of custody is critical. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.213.3">In the event that a piece of evidence has to be brought into a courtroom, any break in the chain of custody can lead to the piece of evidence being excluded from ever being admitted into the proceedings. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.213.4">It is therefore critical to ensure that the entire life cycle of the piece of evidence is recorded.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.214.1">There are two primary ways that a CSIRT can record and maintain the chain of custody of a piece of evidence.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.215.1">The first is </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.216.1">electronically</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.217.1">. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.217.2">There are manufacturers that provide organizations such as forensic laboratories or law </span><a id="_idIndexMarker307"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.218.1">enforcement agencies with hardware and software that automates the chain of custody process for evidence. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.218.2">These systems utilize unique barcoded stickers for each piece of evidence. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.218.3">A scanner then creates an electronic trail as it reads these barcodes.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.219.1">The second method for creating and maintaining a chain of custody is the </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.220.1">paper and pen</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.221.1"> method. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.221.2">This method makes use of paper forms that contain the necessary information to start </span><a id="_idIndexMarker308"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.222.1">and maintain a chain of custody. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.222.2">While the paper and pen method can be a bit cumbersome and requires more due diligence to ensure that the form is safeguarded from destruction or manipulation, it is a much more cost-effective solution for smaller CSIRTs that may not have the resources necessary to implement an automated solution.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.223.1">In terms of what a proper chain of custody form contains, there are several sections, each with its own details that need to be provided. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.223.2">The following screenshot shows a template chain of custody form (an editable chain of custody form is available from NIST at </span><a href="https://www.nist.gov/document/sample-chain-custody-formdocx"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.224.1">https://www.nist.gov/document/sample-chain-custody-formdocx</span></a><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.225.1">).</span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.295.1">The chain of custody is maintained throughout the life of the piece of evidence. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.295.2">Even when </span><a id="_idIndexMarker317"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.296.1">the evidence is destroyed </span><a id="_idIndexMarker318"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.297.1">or returned, an entry is made in the chain of custody form. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.297.2">These forms should be maintained with any other material generated by the incident </span><a id="_idIndexMarker319"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.298.1">and made part of any subsequent report that is created.</span></p>
<h3><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.299.1">Examination</span></h3>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.300.1">The examination phase details the specific tools and forensic techniques that are utilized to discover and </span><a id="_idIndexMarker320"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.301.1">extract data from the evidence that is seized as part of an incident. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.301.2">For example, in a case where malware is suspected to have infected a desktop system as part of a larger attack, the extraction of specific information from an acquired memory image would take part at this stage. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.301.3">In other cases, digital forensics examiners may need to extract </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.302.1">Secure Shell</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.303.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.304.1">SSH</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.305.1">) traffic from a network </span><a id="_idIndexMarker321"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.306.1">capture. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.306.2">The examination of digital evidence also continues the process of proper preservation, in that examiners maintain evidence with the utmost care during the examination. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.306.3">If the digital forensics examiner does not take care to preserve the evidence at this stage, there is the possibility of contamination, which would result in the evidence being unreliable or unusable.</span></p>
<h3><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.307.1">Analysis</span></h3>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.308.1">Once the examination phase has extracted potentially relevant pieces of data, the digital forensics examiner </span><a id="_idIndexMarker322"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.309.1">then analyzes the data, considering any other relevant data obtained. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.309.2">For example, if the digital forensics analyst has discovered that a compromised host has an open connection to an external IP address, they would then correlate that information with an analysis of a packet capture taken from the network. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.309.3">Using the IP address as a starting point, the analyst would be able to isolate that traffic. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.309.4">From here, the analyst may be able to determine that the compromised host is sending out a beacon to a C2 server. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.309.5">From here, using additional sources, the analyst may be able to determine which attack vector is linked to that IP address.</span></p>
<h3><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.310.1">Presentation</span></h3>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.311.1">The reporting of facts </span><a id="_idIndexMarker323"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.312.1">related to digital forensics needs to be clear, concise, and unbiased. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.312.2">In nearly all instances, a forensic examiner will be required to prepare a detailed written report, which addresses every action and captures the critical data required. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.312.3">This report should be thorough, accurate, and without opinion or bias. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.312.4">This report will often be made part of a larger incident investigation and aids in determining the root cause of an incident.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.313.1">Another aspect of presentation is the role that a forensic examiner might play in a criminal or civil proceeding. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.313.2">Testifying in court may be required if the incident under investigation has yielded a suspect or other responsible party. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.313.3">It is during this testimony that the forensic examiner will be required to present the facts of the forensic examination, in much the same dispassionate manner as the report. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.313.4">The examiner will be required to present facts and conclusions without bias and may be limited as far as what the opinions </span><a id="_idIndexMarker324"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.314.1">they can testify are. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.314.2">How an examiner will be allowed to testify is often dependent on their training and experience. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.314.3">Some may be limited to presenting the facts of the examination. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.314.4">Other times, as an examiner acquires skills and has been deemed an expert witness, they may be able to offer an opinion.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-57"><a id="_idTextAnchor057"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.315.1">The digital forensics lab</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.316.1">Digital forensics is an exacting process, which involves the use of proper tools, techniques, and knowledge in order to extract potential evidence from systems. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.316.2">It is imperative that forensic </span><a id="_idIndexMarker325"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.317.1">examiners have a location that is separate from normal business operations. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.317.2">The best approach to achieving this separation is to provide CSIRT members directly involved in the examination of digital evidence with a location that is completely separate from the rest of the organization. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.317.3">A digital forensics lab should have several key features to ensure that examiners have the necessary privacy, but also to ensure the integrity of the evidence while it is being examined.</span></p>
<h3><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.318.1">Physical security</span></h3>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.319.1">Access to the forensic lab needs to be strictly controlled. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.319.2">In order to maintain a chain of custody, only those </span><a id="_idIndexMarker326"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.320.1">with a justifiable need should be allowed access to the lab. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.320.2">This limitation is necessary to remove any chance that the evidence can be tampered with or destroyed. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.320.3">The lab should therefore remain locked at all times. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.320.4">Ideally, access should be granted via access cards or fobs, with a central management system granting access. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.320.5">This allows for a complete reconstruction of all personnel who access the laboratory within a specific time period.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.321.1">The laboratory should also contain evidence lockers so that evidence can be properly stored while not being examined. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.321.2">Lockers should be secured, either through an onboard lock or through the use of a combination lock. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.321.3">The keys to these lockers should be secured within the laboratory and access should only be given to examiners. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.321.4">If the organization has adequate resources, each specific incident should have its own locker, with all the evidence contained within a single locker. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.321.5">This reduces the chance of digital evidence becoming commingled.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.322.1">The climate and </span><a id="_idIndexMarker327"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.323.1">humidity should be controlled in much the same way as in any data center and should be set to the appropriate levels.</span></p>
<h3><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.324.1">Tools</span></h3>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.325.1">Depending on the specific examinations to be performed, it may become necessary to remove screws or </span><a id="_idIndexMarker328"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.326.1">cut wires. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.326.2">Having a small set of hand tools will be convenient for examiners. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.326.3">The laboratory should also be stocked with boxes for securing evidence. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.326.4">If examiners may have to process smartphones or tablets, Faraday bags should be available. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.326.5">These bags allow examiners to isolate a smartphone or tablet from the cellular network while still maintaining a power source.</span></p>
<h4><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.327.1">Hardware</span></h4>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.328.1">The laboratory should have sufficient computers and other hardware to perform a variety of necessary </span><a id="_idIndexMarker329"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.329.1">functions. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.329.2">Examiners will be tasked with imaging hard drives and processing gigabytes of data. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.329.3">As a result, a forensic computer with sufficient RAM is necessary. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.329.4">While there are personal preferences for the amount, a minimum of 32 GB of RAM is recommended. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.329.5">In addition to memory and processing power, examiners will often be looking at a large amount of data. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.329.6">Forensic workstations should have a primary OS drive that can contain forensic software and a secondary drive to hold evidence. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.329.7">The secondary drive should contain 2 TB of storage or more.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.330.1">In addition to a forensic workstation, the examiner should also be provided with an internet-connected computer. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.330.2">The forensic workstation should have no internet connection to maintain security, but also to guard against the possible corruption of evidence during an examination. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.330.3">A secondary machine should be used to conduct research or write reports.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.331.1">Another piece of critical information is a physical write blocker. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.331.2">This device allows for a connection between a hard drive seized as evidence and the forensic imaging machine. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.331.3">The critical difference between this physical write blocker and a USB or Thunderbolt connection is that the digital forensics examiner can be sure that there is no data written to the evidence drive. </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.332.1">Figure 3.7</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.333.1"> shows the Tableau eSATA Forensic Bridge physical write blocker:</span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.336.1">For digital forensics laboratories that conduct a higher number of imaging tasks, there is the option of </span><a id="_idIndexMarker330"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.337.1">including a dedicated forensic imaging station. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.337.2">This allows for quicker imaging of evidence drives and does not tie up a forensic workstation. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.337.3">The drawback is its expense: if the CSIRT member does not see a performance drop without it, it may be hard to justify such an expense.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.338.1">The CSIRT should also invest in an inventory of high-capacity external USB drives. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.338.2">These are much easier to work with and use in the imaging process than traditional SATA or IDE drives. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.338.3">These drives are utilized to store an evidence drive image for further analysis. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.338.4">The CSIRT member should have at least six of these high-capacity drives available. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.338.5">Drives that have 2 TB to 3 TB of storage space can possibly store several images at a time. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.338.6">Smaller USB drives are also useful to have on hand to capture log files and memory images for later processing. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.338.7">With any of these USB drives, having the latest 3.0 version allows for faster processing as well.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.339.1">Finally, digital forensics examiners that support a CSIRT should have a durable case to transport all the necessary hardware, in the event they have to conduct an off-site examination. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.339.2">Many of </span><a id="_idIndexMarker331"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.340.1">these tools are fragile and would not stand the pounding enacted by baggage handlers at the local airport. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.340.2">The CSIRT should invest in at least two hard-sided cases, such as those used for electronic or photographic equipment. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.340.3">One case can transport hardware such as external hard drives and the second can transport a forensics laptop and minimize the potential damage caused by rough handling.</span></p>
<h4><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.341.1">Software</span></h4>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.342.1">There are a number of software tools on the commercial and freeware market today. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.342.2">A digital forensics </span><a id="_idIndexMarker332"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.343.1">laboratory should have access to several tools to perform similar functions. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.343.2">At a minimum, the lab should have software that can perform imaging of evidence drives, examine images, analyze memory captures, and report findings.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.344.1">There are several different types of forensic software that a digital forensics analyst can utilize. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.344.2">The first of these is forensic applications. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.344.3">These applications are purpose-designed to perform a variety of digital forensics tasks. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.344.4">They are often commercially available and are widely used in law enforcement and government communities, as well as in private industry. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.344.5">The following four forensic applications are the most common and widely deployed:</span></p>
<ul>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.416.1">One facet of incident response that can present a challenge to CSIRT team members is the possibility that they </span><a id="_idIndexMarker355"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.417.1">may have to respond to incidents outside their own location. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.417.2">Off-site response is quite common in larger enterprises and is even the norm in CSIRTs that consult for other organizations. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.417.3">As a result, CSIRTs may often have to perform the entire response at another location, without the support of a digital forensics laboratory. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.417.4">With this challenge in mind, CSIRTs should prepare several jump kits. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.417.5">These kits are preconfigured and contain the hardware and software necessary to perform the tasks a CSIRT would be called upon to carry out during an incident. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.417.6">These kits should be able to sustain an incident investigation throughout the process, with the CSIRT identifying secure areas at the incident location in which to store and analyze evidence.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.418.1">Jump kits should be portable, able to be configured to fit within a secure hard-sided case, and ready to be deployed at any time. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.418.2">CSIRTs should ensure that after each incident, the jump kit is restocked with any items that were utilized in the last incident, and that hardware and software are properly configured so that analysts can be confident in their availability during an incident. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.418.3">An example of a jump kit can be seen in the following photo.</span></p>

<ul>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.422.1">A forensic laptop</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.423.1">: This laptop should contain enough RAM (32 GB) to image a hard drive in a reasonable amount of time. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.423.2">The laptop should also contain a forensic software </span><a id="_idIndexMarker356"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.424.1">platform (as previously discussed). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.424.2">If possible, the laptop should also contain at least one Linux forensic OS, such as CAINE or SIFT.</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.425.1">Networking cables</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.426.1">: Having several CAT5 cables of varying lengths is useful in the event that the CSIRT team has to access a network or patch into any network hardware, such as a router or a switch.</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.427.1">A physical write blocker</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.428.1">: Each kit should have a physical write blocker, which can be used to image any hard drives that CSIRT personnel may encounter.</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.429.1">External USB hard drives</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.430.1">: The jump kit should contain several 1 TB or 2 TB USB hard drives. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.430.2">These will be used for imaging hard drives on potentially compromised systems.</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.431.1">External USB devices</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.432.1">: It is not forensically sound to store evidence collected from log sources or RAM captures on a potentially compromised system. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.432.2">The jump kit should contain several large-capacity (64 GB) USBs for offloading log files, RAM captures, or other information obtained from command-line outputs.</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.433.1">A bootable USB or CD/DVD</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.434.1">: While not utilized in every case, having several bootable Linux distributions can be useful in the event that the forensic laptop is currently performing another task.</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.435.1">Evidence bags or boxes</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.436.1">: It may become necessary to seize a piece of evidence and transport it off-site while an incident is ongoing. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.436.2">There should be the capability to secure evidence on-site without having to search around for a proper container.</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.437.1">Anti-static bags</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.438.1">: In the event that hard drives are seized as evidence, they should be transported in anti-static bags.</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.439.1">Chain of custody forms</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.440.1">: As previously discussed, having a chain of custody form for each piece </span><a id="_idIndexMarker357"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.441.1">of evidence is critical. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.441.2">Having a dozen blank forms available saves the trouble of trying to find a system and printer to print out new copies.</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.442.1">A toolkit</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.443.1">: A small toolkit that contains screwdrivers, pliers, and a flashlight comes in handy when hard drives must be removed, connections must be cut, or the analyst has to access a dark corner of the data center.</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.444.1">A notepad and writing instrument</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.445.1">: Proper documentation is critical; handwritten notes in pen may seem old-fashioned but they are the best way to reconstruct events as an incident continues to develop. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.445.2">Having several steno notebooks and pens as part of the kit ensures that CSIRT personnel do not have to hunt down these items when a critical event has just occurred. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.445.3">Jump kits should be inventoried at least monthly so that they are fully stocked and prepared for deployment. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.445.4">They should also be secured and accessible to CSIRT personnel only. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.445.5">Left in public view, these kits are often raided by other personnel in search </span><a id="_idIndexMarker358"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.446.1">of a screwdriver, network cable, or flashlight. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.446.2">For CSIRTs that support geographically dispersed organizations, with several kits at key locations, such as major office headquarters, data centers, or other off-site locations, it may be a good idea to have several of these jump kits prestaged for use. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.446.3">This avoids having to cart the kit through an airport. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.446.4">An example of some items to be stocked in a jump kit can be seen in the following photo.</span></li>
