    activities that could compromise the integrity, confidentiality, or availability
    of information systems. Building effective threat detection mechanisms involves
    multiple layers and techniques to ensure comprehensive coverage. Here, we’ll explore
    various strategies, including **signature-based detection**, **anomaly detection**,
    and **behavioral analysis**.

    activities. These signatures are typically derived from the characteristics of
    previously identified threats, such as specific sequences of bytes in a virus,
    or patterns of behavior indicative of a specific type of attack. Tools such as
    antivirus software and **Intrusion Detection Systems** (**IDSs**) often use signature-based
    detection to identify threats, by comparing incoming data against these known
    signatures.
