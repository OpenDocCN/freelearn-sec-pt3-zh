    those issues, you will need to prepare yourself.

  zh: 我记得几年前我参与过的一场审判。我是辩方在一起涉及数字证据和非法图像持有案件中的专家。在审查报告时，发现数字证据扣押方法存在问题。根据报告中的信息，计算机系统并未按照符合最佳实践的方式进行扣押。我在首席律师准备交叉询问负责扣押的主要代理人时，向他通报了这些问题。由于这位代理人在作证方面经验不足，因此在交叉询问时，代理人的作证效果并不理想。当律师开始讨论数字证据的扣押问题时，代理人承认自己违反了“首要指令”。

    directive?* My only reference for the prime directive is watching episodes of
    the TV show Star Trek. What occurred is that the attorney conflated best practices

    he answered that he violated the prime directive. He stated that he had just been
    worn down by the defense attorney’s questions and did not want to appear stupid
    in front of the jury or his peers. I can understand that. Let’s now talk about
    how to prevent that.

    lawyers will ask you a question that requires a narrative answer but they want

    whether they should appoint me as an expert. After they questioned me about my
    qualifications, education, and experience, I was asked my opinion about the state
    of the evidence I had reviewed. On cross-examination, the prosecution told me,
    “*Your duty as an expert is to find things wrong in the evidence.*” My reply was
    that as an expert, my job was to see whether I could recreate the examination
    and achieve the same results and conclusion. If the information I found was detrimental
    to the theory supported by the defense or the prosecution, I would disclose it
    no matter which side of the matter I was appointed to represent. With digital
    forensics, the data is the data; there is not a lot of interpretation about what
    the data means.
