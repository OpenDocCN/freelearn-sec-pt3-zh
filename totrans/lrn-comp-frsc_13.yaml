    those issues, you will need to prepare yourself.

    allowed by members of their organization who have certified as a **Certified Computer

    whenever they are conducting a digital forensic examination.

- en: Maintaining a code of ethics in your professional life allows you to keep your
    objectivity during the investigation. If you cannot be impartial, you should not
    be a party to the investigation. I recently took part in a motion hearing to determine
    whether they should appoint me as an expert. After they questioned me about my
    qualifications, education, and experience, I was asked my opinion about the state
    of the evidence I had reviewed. On cross-examination, the prosecution told me,
    “*Your duty as an expert is to find things wrong in the evidence.*” My reply was
    that as an expert, my job was to see whether I could recreate the examination
    and achieve the same results and conclusion. If the information I found was detrimental
    to the theory supported by the defense or the prosecution, I would disclose it
    no matter which side of the matter I was appointed to represent. With digital
    forensics, the data is the data; there is not a lot of interpretation about what
    the data means.

    certifications. The possession of certifications does not guarantee or make you
    an exceptional digital forensic investigator.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A certification states that you have met the minimum standards of that organization.
    It does not mean you cannot make a mistake or come to the wrong conclusion. It
    also ensures that you are keeping current with the changes in the field. What
    was acceptable 5 years ago may not be acceptable now because of changes in technology
    or the law. Your training never stops as you pursue a career in this field.
  prefs: []

- en: Ethics is doing the right thing when no one is looking. If you compromise your
    ethics, you can negatively affect your career and investigation. Remember that
    your goal is to be unbiased and present the facts of the matter to the fact-finder.
    You are not an advocate for either side of the matter and you now have the knowledge
    to accomplish that goal.
