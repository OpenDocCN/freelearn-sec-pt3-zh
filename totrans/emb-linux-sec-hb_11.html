			<h1 id="_idParaDest-172"><a id="_idTextAnchor340"/>Knowing the Threat Landscape – Staying Informed</h1>&#13;
			<p>In this chapter, we’re going to go on a data-gathering journey, which is a slight departure from the super technical hands-on exercises. Instead, we’re going to exercise our minds by enhancing our data collection efforts. This isn’t user data or performance data; it’s possible threat and prevention data – golden nuggets throughout.</p>&#13;
			<p>I’m going to take you through a quick personal tour of websites, blogs, and other miscellaneous resources that you’ll want to add to your own personal security toolkit. Before I drag you through this jungle, I will give up a couple of disclaimers. Firstly, just because I am mentioning it, doesn’t mean I endorse it. You’re smart and resourceful. You are capable of making your own decisions on how to process what you’re about to learn. Secondly, I accept that my language capabilities are limited; I know I am missing many foreign and non-English sites. It’s not that I am being inconclusive, but it’s virtually impossible once language barriers get in the way. Good thing that most international tech sites are by nature often in English.</p>&#13;
			<p>Following the resources, subscribing to the newsletters, and ensuring your vendors are emailing you updates is a huge step in ensuring that you and your team stay informed and prepared. I also recommend that you do more than simply observe; I suggest that you actively participate in making a positive impact within the security community if that’s feasible for you.</p>&#13;
			<p>Please understand that this chapter is meant to guide you to available informational resources (mostly freely available resources). It’s my aspiration that this gives you and your team a good starting point of where to gather information <a id="_idTextAnchor341"/>in order to make better-informed decisions.</p>&#13;
			<p>As a companion to this chapter, there will be a cheat sheet with tons of URLs and suggestions that we cover here. It can be found in the book’s GitHub repository (<a href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/The-Embedded-Linux-Security-Handbook/blob/main/Chapter11/Resource_Cheat_Sheet.pdf">https://github.com/PacktPublishing/The-Embedded-Linux-Security-Handbook/blob/main/Chapter11/Resource_Cheat_Sheet.pdf</a>). It’s my plan to keep this cheat sheet as a living document with updates as they become available. So, check the repository regularly for updates.</p>&#13;
			<p>In this chapter, you will learn about many resources, publicly and commercially available. You will review how to find security data relevant to your appliance and how to apply that information as part of your build chain. I’ll also (hopefully) entice you to join in, be active, and participate in the Linux community.</p>&#13;
			<p>We will have the following main headings in this chapter:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>Navigating the information and disinformation online</li>&#13;
				<li>Knowing what vulnerabilities can impact your builds</li>&#13;
				<li>Being part of the solution</li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-173"><a id="_idTextAnchor342"/>Navigating the information and disinformation online</h1>&#13;
			<p>As we’ve all come to know, not all internet sources are equal. Some can be regarded as diamonds in the rough, whereas most websites are generally just <em class="italic">okay</em>. As I feel compelled to also mention, some websites are just places to be avoided at all costs. Rarely do we know which falls into that category until it’s too late. It’s safe to say that we’ve all at least once clicked on a link and, before the page finished loading, said to ourselves, “Oh man, why did I click on that?!” Instantaneous regret. My only point here is for you to properly consider and vet your own information sources.</p>&#13;
			<p>Over the next few sections, I will be highlighting some excellent resources that you and your team should be taking advantage of. These resources range from government agency compliance sources, open source resources, and commercially available content, along with blogs, newsletters, and video channels. I’m not saying that you need to use all of them. I’m merely offering you a buffet of consumable knowledge that never gets stale. Eat well. Eat often. Sometimes, I recommend that you change it up and try different ones to sample.</p>&#13;
			<p>As I prefer to remain positive, I have chosen not to dwell on the websites that I perceive as ineffectual or simply flat-out non-productive. Nor do I ever desire to be responsible for ever sending someone to them. Ever. Period. I don’t think I could sleep at night if I had done you that disservice. That said, bring your appetite for knowledge, and let’s move on to our smorgasbord of security resource delights.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-174"><a id="_idTextAnchor343"/>Government resources</h2>&#13;
			<p>Let’s start<a id="_idIndexMarker456"/> with the usual suspects – the websites that because of your industry, location, or status in the marketplace fall under the umbrella of one or multiple compliance regulations. Finding out exactly what is required can be tedious, and implementing those mandates is even more <em class="italic">fun</em>.</p>&#13;
			<p>Don’t expect intuitive interfaces, stylish themes, and graphics, or sometimes even ease of navigation. Government websites generally can be a test of one’s patience. Yet, they are also the pillar of truth when detailed technical security requirements and configurations are mandated for compliance. Do expect, however, an extreme level of professionalism and technical detail. Ignore these resources at your own peril. The following US government resources are, in my humble opinion, the key starting points for gathering and maintaining information related to security threats that you can apply within your appliance’s build chain.<a id="_idTextAnchor344"/></p>&#13;
			<h3>Computer Security Resource Center (CSRC)</h3>&#13;
			<p>This is<a id="_idIndexMarker457"/> hosted by NIST. This<a id="_idIndexMarker458"/> site can be considered the gateway to all cybersecurity in North America. No other site or organization has the level of detail and depth of information anywhere else in the world.</p>&#13;
			<p>That said, it’s easy to get lost here. Why? There’s just so much information available and it is constantly changing. Projects, events, publications, and even information on how to properly engage with NIST itself can be found here.</p>&#13;
			<p>Start here. Take notes, make bookmarks, and plan for follow-up<a id="_idTextAnchor345"/>s.</p>&#13;
			<h3>National Vulnerability Database (NVD)</h3>&#13;
			<p>This is also <a id="_idIndexMarker459"/>hosted by NIST. This<a id="_idIndexMarker460"/> is the home of the CVE database. If it’s a risk or vulnerability, this place has it documented. Search here often. It’s well maintained and is the pillar of truth for cybersecurity vulnerabilities.</p>&#13;
			<p>Where this resource becomes valuable is in its searchability. Here’s an example:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div>&#13;
					<img src="img/B22104_11_1.jpg" alt="Figure 11.1 – Searching NIST’s NVD" width="1316" height="937"/>&#13;
				</p>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 11.1 – Searching NIST’s NVD</p>&#13;
			<p>It’s quite probable<a id="_idIndexMarker461"/> that you may very soon find yourself getting intimately acquainted with the search features within the NIST websites. Hopefully, this book’s introduction helps guide you to finding the<a id="_idIndexMarker462"/> resources that you are seeking. It truly is the nature of the beast. This site will become your lighthouse in the storm, so the sooner you get used to its idiosyncrasies and user-friendliness, the better – the information presented here truly is priceless. I just wish they’d make the UI a little easier on the eyes, if you know what I mean. Let’s now progress onward in our journey by learning how and what to configure in the quest to make our systems more se<a id="_idTextAnchor346"/>cure.</p>&#13;
			<h3>Security Technical Implementation Guides (STIGs)</h3>&#13;
			<p>These <a id="_idIndexMarker463"/>were <a id="_idIndexMarker464"/>published<a id="_idIndexMarker465"/> by the <strong class="bold">Defense Information Systems Agency</strong> (<strong class="bold">DISA</strong>) for their primary customer, the US DOD. These are published as whole libraries of configurations. DISA touts its mission as, “To conduct DODIN operations for the joint warfighter to enable lethality across all warfighting domains in defense of our nation.” Due to its<a id="_idIndexMarker466"/> military roots, usage of this website is monitored, and you will be required to consent to your usage <a id="_idIndexMarker467"/>being tracked when you go there, even if you do not log in.</p>&#13;
			<p>Here’s an example of the STIGs available for Linux today:</p>&#13;
			<p>&#13;
				<div>&#13;
					<img src="img/B22104_11_2.jpg" alt="Figure 11.2 – Linux STIGs available today" width="1378" height="865"/>&#13;
				</p>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 11.2 – Linux STIGs available today</p>&#13;
			<p>To properly view these, you will need to download their <strong class="bold">Viewer</strong> tool as well. Leveraging their recommendations will help to ensure that your solution has been configured with the best-intended level of <a id="_idTextAnchor347"/>security.</p>&#13;
			<p>Personally, I have the STIG Viewer installed on multiple systems in my lab and also on my work laptop. I prefer to keep the ability to dive deep into what configurations might be needed readily available to me regardless of where I am at. You may also reach this same conclusion as you progress in your own journey.</p>&#13;
			<p>Let’s now continue our journey by looking at commercially available r<a id="_idTextAnchor348"/>esources.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-175"><a id="_idTextAnchor349"/>Commercial resources</h2>&#13;
			<p>We have to go<a id="_idIndexMarker468"/> there. Not everything mentioned in this book is free. This <a id="_idIndexMarker469"/>is to be expected, even more so in the enterprise security space. Not all these tools and resources are able to be feasibly run in someone’s home lab as cost and hardware requirements might just ultimately make it impossible for most people. That said, all these solution providers do have free publicly available resources that all can take advantage of.</p>&#13;
			<p>This list of vendors is by no means exhaustive, nor should any listing here be seen as an endorsement. Know the key players. Here are some of them.</p>&#13;
			<h3>Reversing Labs®</h3>&#13;
			<p>Headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Reversing Labs®<a id="_idIndexMarker470"/> brings a <a id="_idIndexMarker471"/>unique offering to the table for those with advanced security consciousness. Their flagship product has the ability to check for risks without access to the source code. They also provide a wide range of enterprise security and Bill of Materials offerings.</p>&#13;
			<h3>Qualys®</h3>&#13;
			<p>Headquartered<a id="_idIndexMarker472"/> in Foster City, California, Qualys® offers a wide<a id="_idIndexMarker473"/> range of products that are tailored to multiple industry verticals, including the government. What they are most known for is their ability to scan and detect risks across the enterprise. Qualys is a huge player in the security industry.</p>&#13;
			<h3>Tenable®</h3>&#13;
			<p>Headquartered<a id="_idIndexMarker474"/> in Columbia, Maryland, Tenable® is another <a id="_idIndexMarker475"/>security industry juggernaut. They, too, are most known for their security scanning tools, although they have many other products and solutions.</p>&#13;
			<h3>McAfee®</h3>&#13;
			<p>Headquartered<a id="_idIndexMarker476"/> in San Jose, California, McAfee® is a well-recognized <a id="_idIndexMarker477"/>name in the virus protection space. They also provide many other products and services mostly focused on secure VPN and identity protection.</p>&#13;
			<h3>Norton®</h3>&#13;
			<p>Co-headquartered <a id="_idIndexMarker478"/>in Tempe, Arizona and Prague, Czech Republic, Norton<a id="_idIndexMarker479"/>® is most known for its antivirus solutions, identity protection, performance management, and VPN solutions. Norton products generally only support Windows, macOS, and Android (which is actually a variant of Linux).</p>&#13;
			<h3>Kaspersky®</h3>&#13;
			<p>Headquartered<a id="_idIndexMarker480"/> in London, UK, the Kaspersky® company is <a id="_idIndexMarker481"/>another huge player in the antivirus space. It also has products in the identity protection and smart home monitoring space and has e<a id="_idTextAnchor350"/>xtensive Linux support.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-176"><a id="_idTextAnchor351"/>Community resources</h2>&#13;
			<p>Both the Linux <a id="_idIndexMarker482"/>community and the security community offer the public a wealth<a id="_idIndexMarker483"/> of resources online. User groups, newsletters, documentation, best practices guides, and project websites are just the beginning of where you should start gathering data.</p>&#13;
			<p>These resources cost you nothing but time and effort. In my book, that’s time well spent. It’s not lost on me as I typed that; that quote is going into my book. Yes, I actually repeated it to myself and laughed out loud. I stand by that position. Engage the community. Be part of the community.</p>&#13;
			<h3>The Center for Internet Security® (CIS®)</h3>&#13;
			<p><strong class="bold">CIS</strong> Benchmarks<a id="_idIndexMarker484"/> are often<a id="_idIndexMarker485"/> considered the global go-to for how to configure a secure Linux system. Expect excellent, detailed configuration recommendations that range from easy to complex to apply to your solution. CIS® is a community-driven and supported non-profit organization whose goal is to help the global community build more secure solutions.</p>&#13;
			<p>When I first began my journey into Linux security resources, seemingly a lifetime ago, this was my first waypoint. Maybe that’s just because I consider myself a community-first kind of engineer. Time spent on this website is quality time. The CIS site is a wealth of information, security benchmarks, configuration recommendations, and even pre-built, ready-to-deploy systems images.</p>&#13;
			<p>If <a id="_idIndexMarker486"/>government compliance is not your mandate, then the resources presented here alone may satisfy<a id="_idIndexMarker487"/> most or even all your needs. I make no assumptions on your behalf, so I recommend you form your own opinions and valuations while taking advantage of what CIS has to offer.</p>&#13;
			<h3>OpenSCAP</h3>&#13;
			<p>A key <a id="_idIndexMarker488"/>community resource is the OpenSCAP website. This<a id="_idIndexMarker489"/> site gives you the tools to scan your systems against industry standards and government or custom policies. It’s truly an invaluable tool for your team’s build chain. We will be talking more about this tool in chapters to come. Failure to use this tool or something similar may put your product in future peril. Choose wisely. I truly want you to succeed.</p>&#13;
			<p>Here’s a great example of some of the tools available on the OpenSCAP site:</p>&#13;
			<p>&#13;
				<div>&#13;
					<img src="img/B22104_11_3.jpg" alt="Figure 11.3 – Tools from OpenSCAP" width="1122" height="943"/>&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 11.3 – Tools from OpenSCAP</p>&#13;
			<h3>Linux user groups</h3>&#13;
			<p>Linux user groups <a id="_idIndexMarker490"/>are an amazing way of getting involved<a id="_idIndexMarker491"/> with minimal effort. Attending these meetings can be a refreshing escape from marketing and salespeople. Mostly, it’s engineers sharing stories with other engineers. I’ve led many of these over the years and I have found the attendees come from all walks of the technology field. Quite often, though, I find students, IT managers, and even executives quietly attending just to learn more about a new technology in a stress-free environment. Above all other community resources, a user group is the greatest way of connecting with those in the know who are actively involved in technology.</p>&#13;
			<h3>Security user groups</h3>&#13;
			<p>Security user groups (or cybersecurity user groups) are just as educational as their Linux-focused <a id="_idIndexMarker492"/>counterparts. They are often led by a<a id="_idIndexMarker493"/> product vendor but not always. These groups often tend to be more focused on an industry vertical or specific set of products. I highly recommend joining one or more. The knowledge you gain will be priceless and may help you preemptively prevent a product disaster.</p>&#13;
			<p>Knowing what tooling your team uses along with what community resources they hope to use in the appliance is key knowledge and a <a id="_idTextAnchor352"/>perfect segue to the next section.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-177"><a id="_idTextAnchor353"/>Knowing what vulnerabilities can impact your builds</h1>&#13;
			<p>Equally important to<a id="_idIndexMarker494"/> the tracking of your product contents for determining what is in each release, tracking said contents versus what vulnerabilities exist also gives you a carved-in-stone list of what to track from a bug list and security vulnerability perspective. These lists are not persistent, as dependencies can change with updates as some packages become deprecated. Tracking ends when your product ends. Security concerns never end. Hackers and bad actors never sleep. Invest in good software and better<a id="_idTextAnchor354"/> processes. Always, always, always know the ingredients for your recipe.</p>&#13;
			<p>In earlier chapters, we reviewed in detail how to create a software manifest of what was in a specific build or release of your product. We’ve also reviewed hardware implications such as firmware and drivers. This knowledge gives you a virtual checklist of all the things you’ll need to check for bugs and security issues along with the fixes for all of them. These lists become your starting point for what may be an arduous and never-ending investigation effort.</p>&#13;
			<p>The average Linux distribution may have 7,000 or more packages to choose from. Does your security team want to track all 7,000 for you? Do they want you to use such a high number of packages? This is where people tend to rant and rave about minimizing the software footprint (i.e., only installing the bare minimum packages to allow the system to work properly). Once you track this for yourself, you’ll appreciate the value of the minimal installation.</p>&#13;
			<p>Not only does a smaller footprint make supporting the solution easier from an update perspective but it provides fewer avenues for possible attackers to go at your solution. So, I say use whatever you like in the initial prototyping phase but get surgical and exact in removing (or simply not installing) anything not needed. This exercise will bring you closer to your product and assist you further as we delve into keeping tabs <a id="_idTextAnchor355"/>on the components of your solution.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-178"><a id="_idTextAnchor356"/>Running smart searches based on your components</h2>&#13;
			<p>It <a id="_idIndexMarker495"/>could be a full-time job just looking up all the possible issues that may impact on your product, so unless you have an unlimited budget, you and your team will need to work efficiently in this effort. Wherever possible, use automation to confirm that there might be an issue.</p>&#13;
			<p>This might require you to create some scripts or a database of your components and feed that mechanism all the email updates, release notes, and newsletters you may get from community sources or from your vendors.</p>&#13;
			<p>Without automation, this can be a truly tedious effort – one where something will eventually slip between the cracks. It happens even to the greatest teams. So, I highly recommend curating this data so your team can review any interesting findings on a regular basis. Knowing a software package has an open CVE attached to it that has yet to be fixed, in my opinion, is critical information. I’m pretty sure that your team would agree.</p>&#13;
			<p>Sadly, there is no one pillar of truth that can help guide you here. The more sources you get bug and security issue data from, the better. Your vendors’ email updates, which you hopefully signed up for, are the first place to start but not the last. Gather data from blogs, newsletters, and government compliance sites, as well. Together, you should be able to create a virtual security weather report for your product and tie that knowledge to your product’s roadmap.</p>&#13;
			<p>Store all the collected data as text. This is where a good set of scripts can take your manifest and see if any of your packages or hardware is impacted. Although it is a complicated process or workflow, you should be able to ultimately create your own database from which to report. A spreadsheet may be easier until you truly identify all aspects of data and data sources that you chose to collate. The CSV format can give you a jumpstart here too. Regardless of the myriad of ways to rummage through this data, creating a concise report at the component level will give you that desired virtual security weather report that you seek. This may have some blind spots because you’re building this from known searchable data. Undiscovered zero-day exploits can still hurt us all.</p>&#13;
			<p>Security scanning tools in the build chain are yet another source of data and a crucial one not to be ignored. Do not rely upon them 100%. Some vendors offer additional products to <a id="_idIndexMarker496"/>complement the scanning tools that they sell. These tools, like Tenable’s Vulnerability Management suite, can assist your efforts and give you that bird’s-eye view you seek.</p>&#13;
			<p>I find myself in a quandary and dislike mentioning this but here’s where I think in the very near future some creative usage of AI might be a good thing. So, indulge me for just a moment. As security experts are developing AI-enhanced security tools today, you can also believe that there are bad actors all over the world looking to leverage AI to take their exploits to a new level. That said, I say stay vigilant, and let’s move on to<a id="_idTextAnchor357"/> how you can be part of the solution.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-179"><a id="_idTextAnchor358"/>Being part of the solution</h1>&#13;
			<p>There are so<a id="_idIndexMarker497"/> many ways that you can contribute to the Linux and security communities.</p>&#13;
			<p>By reading this book, you have already begun that journey if you haven’t already dived deep into embedded Linux systems security. Welcome to the party and, again, thanks for buying my book. Don’t let this be a single event for you. Check the book’s GitHub (<a href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/The-Embedded-Linux-Security-Handbook">https://github.com/PacktPublishing/The-Embedded-Linux-Security-Handbook</a>) from time to time. It will get updates as things evolve too.</p>&#13;
			<p>This community is perhaps as old as (or older than) many who are now looking for education, answers, or mentoring. Age has little relevance here, nor should it ever. What matters is the desire to learn or share knowledge and experiences. Security risks are equal opportunity offenders. If you don’t prepare, they’ll get you. Hence, we have a vibrant and diverse community of engineers, developers, testers, technical writers, and thought leaders. I won’t be so pretentious to spell out a plan for how you should or should not get involved or contribute. All I, along with many others in the communities, hope for is that you take that big step to get more involved. In the next sections, yo<a id="_idTextAnchor359"/>u’ll see just what I am talking about.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-180"><a id="_idTextAnchor360"/>Contribute to the development process</h2>&#13;
			<p>You don’t have<a id="_idIndexMarker498"/> to be a developer to be able to contribute here. You could volunteer to test early-access code, file bug reports, or even submit a Request For Enhancement (RFE). The feedback you provide will be crucial for those doing development.</p>&#13;
			<p>Should you choose to be part of that process, there are several Linux communities that you could join. Each of these open source communities have its own process and guidelines for contributing and getting actively involved. Each has its own culture, but all will welcome you aboard.</p>&#13;
			<p>Below, you’ll find some links on how to join in the testing and development effort for several popular community Linux distributions:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>Fedora® (<a href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/project/join/">https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/project/join/</a>)</li>&#13;
				<li>CentOS Streams® (<a href="https://centos.org/">https://centos.org/</a>)</li>&#13;
				<li>Ubuntu® (<a href="https://ubuntu.com/community/contribute/ubuntu-development">https://ubuntu.com/community/contribute/ubuntu-development</a>)</li>&#13;
				<li>openSUSE® (<a href="https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Heroes">https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Heroes</a>)</li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>Who knows? Your contributions might just save others a lot of pain and hassle as well as solve your own Linux security issues. Wouldn’t that make anyone feel just a little good about being an active community member? Let’s move on to other ways to be active in the community.</p>&#13;
			<p>My personal and work experience over the years has granted me a unique view into many community development projects. I’m also a member of the OpenStack community (also known as the OpenInfra community). For me, choosing a group to get involved with was no easy decision. There are many great groups. What I would recommend is simply to follow your heart. Join a community closest to your favorite Linux distribution. If that doesn’t work out for you, at least consider joining a user group focused on the distribution(s) you use professionally, which is a perfect s<a id="_idTextAnchor361"/>egue to our next section – user groups.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-181"><a id="_idTextAnchor362"/>Join a user group</h2>&#13;
			<p><strong class="bold">Meetups</strong> and <strong class="bold">user groups</strong><a id="_idIndexMarker499"/> are the greatest ways of networking within a community, in my opinion. They are devoid of salesy pushes for products and focus on simply sharing creative solutions to real-world technology and security issues.</p>&#13;
			<p>You don’t need to be a rocket scientist or have some fancy title. Neither situation applies to me. I am just an average guy who has been blessed with some rather interesting knowledge and experiences over the expanse of my career. These groups are great for learning or sharing what you’ve learned. One day, you may even choose to get involved with the group’s leadership or present a solution that you and your team devised. I truly love user groups and thoroughly enjoy sharing, when my schedule permits me.</p>&#13;
			<p>Knowing<a id="_idIndexMarker500"/> everything, I think we can all agree, is in actuality totally impossible. For 30 years, I have been in the Linux community, and I still am learning new things all the time. Sometimes it’s hard to convey the vastness, depth, and reach of Linux. One can meet, network with, and learn from others who may have focused on aspects of Linux that you may not have (and vice versa – you can help them too). My point is, never think that your experiences do not matter. They do. Sharing your experiences and solutions might just save someone else a truckload of pain.</p>&#13;
			<p>Joining a user group presents you with a way to grow professionally and all it would ever cost you is your time and attention. Even if you attend and choose just to stay on the sidelines and observe, I assure you that learning opportunities will abound for you. One day, I bet, there will be a discussion, and you (YES, YOU!) will be the one with the answer someone has searched for. Perhaps that situation can also become a catalyst to where you want to participate more and be involved. Organizing, setting up, presenting, and leading a lightning talk on an impromptu technology subject – these are all ways you can get in the game. You may just find that you love user groups too.</p>&#13;
			<p>Why do we do this? It’s simple: sharing is caring… and caring can help build a community. Participate at whatever level you feel comfortable at but participate. The knowledge and networking possibilities are endless.</p>&#13;
			<h3>Leveraging MeetUp</h3>&#13;
			<p><strong class="bold">MeetUp</strong> is a <a id="_idIndexMarker501"/>website that caters to<a id="_idIndexMarker502"/> empowering and connecting people of shared interests. Not just technology enthusiasts but also hikers, book lovers, animal activists, cyclists, and so many more interest groups (more than I can think of) can all be found there, and they are looking for you too.</p>&#13;
			<p>Find a Linux user group or cybersecurity group <a id="_idIndexMarker503"/>near you: <a href="https://www.meetup.com/">https://www.meetup.com/</a>. This is an invaluable resource to connect you with hundreds of thousands of like-minded enthusiasts. I encourage you to try out MeetUp: you might just like it. I look forward to seeing you in a<a id="_idIndexMarker504"/> Linux meetup soon.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-182"><a id="_idTextAnchor363"/>Summary</h1>&#13;
			<p>Thanks for driving onward with me on this amazing journey into what is available in the Linux world for cybersecurity resources and reference materials. As I mentioned earlier, please check the book’s GitHub repository often for updates and new information, especially newly updated resources in the cheat sheet.</p>&#13;
			<p>I trust you have enjoyed this chapter’s departure from making you type and test new technologies. I know that the landscape changes from day to day. This is why I implore you to seek out as many trustworthy resources as possible.</p>&#13;
			<p>We’ve touched briefly on a great many companies and resources in this chapter.
