- en: Before you can begin analysing evidence from a source, it first of all needs
    to be imaged. This describes a forensic process in which an exact copy of a drive
    is made. This is an important step, especially if evidence needs to be taken to
    court, because forensic investigators must be able to demonstrate that they have
    not altered the evidence in any way.

- en: The term *forensic image* can refer to either a physical or a logical image.
    Physical images are precise replicas of the drives they reference, whereas a logical
    image is a copy of a certain volume within that drive. In general, logical images
    show what the machine’s user will have seen and dealt with, whereas physical images
    give a more comprehensive overview of how the device works at a higher level.

- en: A *hash value* is generated to verify the authenticity of the acquired image.
    Hash values are essentially cryptographic digital fingerprints which show whether
    a particular item is an exact copy of another. Altering even the smallest bit
    of data will generate a completely new hash value, thus demonstrating that the
    two items are not the same. When a forensic investigator images a drive, they
    should generate a hash value for both the original drive and the acquired image.
    Some pieces of forensic software will do this for you.

- en: There are a number of tools available for imaging hard drives, some of which
    are free and open source. However, the most popular way for forensic analysts
    to image hard drives is by using one of the more well-known forensic software
    vendors' solutions. This is because it is imperative to be able to explain how
    the image was acquired and its integrity, especially if you are working on a case
    that will be taken to court.

    examiner not only to create forensic images in different formats, including RAW,
    SMART, E01, and AFF, but also to preview data sources in a forensically sound
    manner. In the first recipe of this chapter, we will show you how to create a
    forensic image of a hard drive from a Windows system in E01 format.

    enforcement. Such images consist of a header with case info, including acquisition
    date and time, examiner's name, acquisition notes, and password (optional), a
    bit-by-bit copy of an acquired drive (consisting of data blocks, verified with
    its own CRC or Cyclical Redundancy Check), and a footer with MD5 hash for the
    bitstream.
