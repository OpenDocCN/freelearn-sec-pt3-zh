    data is one of the most developed areas in digital forensics. In this book, we'll
    be covering major points that make tablet forensics different from the traditional
    PC and laptop acquisition approach. In this chapter, we'll cover the new Connected
    Standby mode replacing traditional Sleep and Hibernate modes of Windows laptops,
    discuss **Secure Boot** on various Windows tablet platforms, review UEFI BIOS
    settings, and learn how to start the tablet from a bootable USB media. We'll also
    cover techniques on capturing the content of the device's RAM and imaging non-removable
    eMMC media. But first let's have a look at what Windows tablets are and what they
    aren't.

    recovery media cannot be used with RT devices.

    a special version of Windows called Windows RT to run on hardware with ARM instruction
    sets (Snapdragon 800 and NVIDIA Tegra 4 chip sets in Nokia Lumia 2520, Microsoft
    Surface RT, and Surface 2 among others). Today, Microsoft has officially stated

    of portable electronic devices and promote x86 architecture by subsidizing manufacturers
    who opted to use Intel CPUs in their phones and tablets instead of going for the
    then-prevailing ARM architecture. This lured manufacturers into building tablets
    and phones featuring Intel processors and running Android. Now, with many portable
    devices featuring x86 architecture, there was no longer need for Microsoft to
    go with RT and ARM architecture.

    Microsoft decided to give Windows away to manufacturers of small and inexpensive
    devices. As a result, Microsoft released a special edition of Windows called Windows
    8.1 with Bing, giving it away free of charge to manufacturers of small tablets
    with display sizes of up to 8 inches. Additional incentives Microsoft offers to
    manufacturers who install Windows on their tablets are zero licensing fees for
    its exFAT file system (exFAT is the default file system on 64 GB and larger SDXC
    cards) and no licensing fees (which manufacturers of Android devices would otherwise
    have to pay Microsoft).

    procedure is well known, and experts have long experience dealing with these machines.
    For example, in order to obtain a memory dump one can simply plug a USB drive
    and run a small utility. If that's not possible, one can always exploit a FireWire
    port (if installed), or even install an add-on FireWire adapter if no IEEE.1394
    port is available. This same operation would involve a different technique as

    every Windows 8, 8.1, and Windows 10 tablet ever marketed has a feature in their
    UEFI BIOS called Secure Boot. Secure Boot was developed by members of the PC industry
    to help secure devices' bootloader against booting non-trusted (or, rather, unsigned)
    systems. If configured, Secure Boot allows tablets to boot using only software
    that is trusted by the manufacturer.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The concept of Secure Boot is similar to the concept of locked bootloaders that
    we've seen on Apple iOS and many Android devices, even if its operation and technical
    implementation is different. If Secure Boot is enabled in the computer's UEFI
    BIOS, the computer's firmware verifies digital signatures of each link of the
    boot chain, including firmware drivers and the operating system during the boot.
    The computer will only boot if the signatures pass the check.
  prefs: []

- en: It is important to understand that disabling Secure Boot is *not* required in
    order to boot into a Windows 8.x/Windows 10 recovery image, even if that image
    is stored on an external flash drive. The function of Secure Boot is preventing
    untrusted, unsigned code to run, so if enabled, it will prevent booting into Linux
    or another system.

    10 security model. Device encryption is essentially a feature-limited version
    of BitLocker that encrypts the entire C drive partition. Unlike on desktop and
    laptop computers that are still mostly running on Windows 7, BitLocker device
    encryption is available to users of all versions of Windows 8.x and 10, including
    the core edition and Windows with Bing.

    automatically when the user logs in with their Microsoft Account with administrative
    privileges. After the first login, the system automatically begins the encryption
    process. The encryption process runs in the background. The process is transparent
    and invisible to the end user. The Recovery Key is automatically saved in the
    user's Microsoft Account, and can be retrieved from that account in order to decrypt
    the device. In corporate environments, BitLocker escrow keys are saved in the
    active directory.

    down the tablet via the Power charm (as opposed to doing the same via the Windows
    + *X* menu, which will, counter-intuitively, engage the full shutdown) the system
    will save its kernel and drivers into a smaller version of the hibernation file

    built-in, non-removable (unless one uses a BGA soldering station) eMMC storage.
    Let's think for a moment about the fact that the eMMC chip is soldered onto the
    circuit board. It cannot be removed and put into a write-blocking imaging device.
    It cannot be connected to another computer. In order to image the built-in storage,
    the investigator will have to boot into the system and run an imaging tool on
    the very same device being investigated. This can present challenges due to security

- en: If you think for a moment about how Windows (and most other modern operating
    systems) manage deleted files, you'll realize that information such as deleted
    files and folders is not permanently erased. Instead, the system will simply mark
    files and folders being deleted with a corresponding attribute in the filesystem.
    Disk space originally occupied by these files will be released to the pool of
    available disk space. To reiterate, Windows won't do anything to actually wipe
    or erase data blocks that were previously occupied with deleted data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This behavior had to change with the introduction of solid-state storage media.
    NAND flash-based solid-state storage media is much slower to erase data compared
    to writing to an empty block. In addition, NAND flash cells can be only written
    to a limited number of times, which made some form of wear leveling necessary.
    In order to deal with the two issues, the industry adopted a certain protocol
    for dealing with released data blocks.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A compatible operating system (Windows 7, 8, 8.1 or newer) working with a compatible
    SSD or eMMC storage formatted with the only compatible file system (NTFS) will
    issue the TRIM command to instruct the storage controller that certain data blocks
    no longer contain data. After receiving the TRIM command, the controller will
    add data blocks passed in that command to the list of *dirty* blocks, while remapping
    them (assigning their logical addresses) to already erased blocks from the reserve
    pool. The *dirty* blocks will be slowly erased in the background. Effectively,
    the TRIM command serves as a garbage collection tool, helping SSDs prevent future
    slowdowns to write operations.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For the purpose of digital forensics, this means you can no longer count on
    deleted files being available for recovery after they've been deleted. Due to
    the use of the TRIM command by the operating system and the ongoing operation
    of wear leveling and garbage collection processes in the background, the empty
    blocks will, in most cases, be completely erased without any further interaction.
    In other words, if the user deletes certain files, they'll be truly gone—with
    a few exceptions.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Considering the nature of full-disk encryption and taking into account performance
    and lifespan issues of solid-state media such as SSD and eMMC storage, one inevitably
    arrives to a logical question: what happens to deleted data if full-disk encryption
    is enabled on a solid-state volume? Particularly, will the system sacrifice performance
    by keeping deleted data encrypted, or will it sacrifice security by exposing empty
    (erased) parts of the encrypted volume?'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The answer to this question depends on which combination of hardware and whole-disk
    encryption software is used in a particular system. However, in the case of BitLocker
    and eMMC storage, there is a simple—and official—answer. According to Microsoft
    ([https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/e7/2009/05/05/support-and-qa-for-solid-state-drives/](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/e7/2009/05/05/support-and-qa-for-solid-state-drives/)),
    *Bitlocker's encryption process [is] optimized to work on SSDs [...] on NTFS.
    When Bitlocker is first configured on a partition, the entire partition is read,
    encrypted and written back out. As this is done, the NTFS file system will issue
    Trim commands to help the SSD optimize its behavior.* As we can see, in this particular
    case Microsoft has decided to go after performance while sacrificing a little
    bit of security. As a result, you will *not* be able to recover deleted files
    even if you image the entire BitLocker volume.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Historically, however, this has not always been the case. In the early days
    of SSD's, the then-current whole-disk encryption providers such as TrueCrypt went
    all the way after security, never letting TRIM commands reach the underlying physical
    storage. As a result, TrueCrypt used to have a hugely negative impact on performance
    if whole-disk encryption was used because the SSD controller could no longer tell
    the difference between free space and used up space because on an encrypted disk
    both free space and used space is treated as (encrypted) data. This approach defeated
    the very purpose of TRIM, and effectively disabled wear-leveling optimizations.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In order to mitigate this issue, developers of whole-disk encryption products
    introduced so-called *TRIM Pass-through*. With this feature enabled, the encryption
    product would pass information about free data blocks to the SSD controller, allowing
    it to trim released data blocks. This had a huge positive effect on performance
    and longevity of solid-state media, but exposed information about which data blocks
    were actually occupied by encrypted data to an outside attacker. This was seen
    as a security weakness, and for this reason alone, some WDE manufacturers chose
    not to enable the feature by default.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: After some years, self-encrypting SSDs became available. These SSDs encrypt
    data blocks before writing them at the physical level. The TGS Opal full disk
    encryption standard allows the keys to be set by the OS (providing that both the
    operating system and hardware support the system), effectively fixing the issue
    mentioned above. Therefore, if the Windows device being investigated has a storage
    device (whether SSD or eMMC) that meets the right encryption standards, BitLocker
    makes use of the hardware encryption engine, effectively bypassing the software-based
    encryption in favor of a hardware-based one.

- en: While we said a lot about creating a bootable USB device for Windows RT tablets,
    how or even if it's possible to image one is still a big question. Windows RT
    is an inherently crippled platform with platform-level security measures that
    are extremely effective in disallowing anything but signed code to boot or execute
    on RT devices. Pre-activated Secure Boot that cannot be disabled, ARM architecture
    instead of x86, and system-level trusted signature checks for all desktop applications
    make traditional acquisition techniques ineffective.

    which is not always available as an option during routine investigations. BitLocker

- en: Windows RT is a crippled and secure platform. By default, the C drive partition
    where all the user files reside is protected with BitLocker. Booting from the
    recovery media, accessing the **Windows Recovery Environment** (**WinRE**) Command
    Prompt or otherwise attempting to log in without supplying the correct account
    password or PIN code will result in being locked out and unable to access information
    stored on the partition of interest. As a result, Windows RT forensics requires
    you to know either a password to an administrative account (or, in a worst-case
    scenario, to any local account at all) or to have access to the BitLocker Recovery
    Key. More information about this in the *Acquiring BitLocker Encryption Key* section.

    *"Although Windows RT 8.1 cannot create encrypted BitLocker To Go USB drives or
    SD cards, it is able to use these drives or cards after they have been encrypted
    from Windows 8 Pro or Windows 8 Enterprise (or even Windows 7) computers. When
    inserting the BitLocker To Go USB drive or SD card, the user will be prompted
    to provide the required password before they can access or update the data on
    the USB drive or SD card."*

    any other RT tablet. You managed to boot the device from a USB recovery media
    containing Windows RT, and have full access to the command line. As with Android
    or iOS tablets, there's not a lot you can do to image it since the tablet is running
    on an ARM CPU and is locked to only allow built-in desktop tools to run. Since
    Windows RT tablets can't execute x86 code (and can't run unsigned ARM code), support
    from manufacturers of forensic tools is non-existent. This all means that, in
    your forensic needs, you are limited to using command-line tools that are built
    into Windows.

    of Windows 8.x and Windows 10 tablets, and addressed the issues of ARM-based Windows
    tablets running the dedicated ARM-based version of Windows, Windows RT. We learned
    about automatic BitLocker encryption and reviewed methods of circumventing BitLocker
    protection by extracting BitLocker Recovery Keys from the user's Microsoft Account.
    Finally, we learned how to break in to Microsoft Account by executing an offline
    password recovery attack on the user's cached password. In the next chapter, we'll
    move back to smartphones and look into acquisition options available for BlackBerry
    smartphones.
