- en: One critical task that incident response analysts often must perform is imaging
    digital evidence. As we discussed in prior chapters, a great deal of evidence
    related to an incident can be found within log files, memory, and other areas
    and can be acquired relatively quickly. In some incidents, such as internal malicious
    activity (for example, fraud, industrial espionage, or data leakage), a more detailed
    search for evidence may be required. This evidence includes master file table
    entries, files, and specific user data that is contained on the hard drive of
    a suspect system. If incident response analysts encounter such circumstances,
    they will be required to obtain an image of a suspect drive. As with any aspect
    of digital forensics, obtaining a usable and court-defensible image depends on
    the appropriate tools, techniques, and documentation being used.

  zh: 图像与复制
- en: One of the first concepts that should be understood is the difference between
    forensic imaging and copying. Copying files from a suspect hard drive or another
    medium only provides analysts with the actual data associated with that file.
    Imaging, on the other hand, allows the analyst to capture the entire drive. This
    includes areas such as slack space, unallocated space, and possibly accessing
    deleted files. Imaging also maintains metadata on the volume, including file timestamps.
    This becomes critical if a timeline analysis is conducted to determine when specific
    files were accessed or deleted.
  id: totrans-14

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 首先应理解的一个概念是法医成像与复制之间的区别。从嫌疑人硬盘或其他介质中复制文件，只能为分析师提供与该文件相关的实际数据。另一方面，成像允许分析师捕捉整个驱动器的数据。这包括如空闲空间、未分配空间以及可能访问已删除文件的区域。成像还会保留卷上的元数据，包括文件时间戳。如果进行时间线分析以确定特定文件何时被访问或删除，这一点至关重要。
- en: Often, the terms *cloning* and *imaging* are utilized in place of each other.
    This is a common improper use of terminology in the IT realm. When cloning a drive,
    a one-to-one copy of the drive is made. This means that the drive can then be
    inserted into a system and booted. Cloning a drive is often done to make a fully
    functional backup of a critical drive. While a cloned drive contains all the necessary
    files, it is cumbersome to work with, especially with forensic tools. As a result,
    an image file is taken. An image of a drive contains all the necessary files;
    its configuration permits a detailed examination while utilizing forensic tools.

    can be imaged. Volumes can be separated into physical or logical volumes. Physical
    volumes can be thought of as containing the entirety of a hard drive. This includes
    any partitions, as well as the `D:` drive. When imaging a logical volume, the
    analyst would only capture data contained within the `D:` drive.

  zh: 图8.1 – 物理卷与逻辑卷

    imaging that is conducted. For example, if an analyst can identify a potentially
    malicious file being executed from the `D:` drive and is intent on only capturing
    that data, it might be faster to acquire a logical image of only that volume.
    Furthermore, a logical acquisition may be necessary in cases where **Full Disk
    Encryption** (**FDE**) is being used. Without the encryption key, logically acquiring
    files while the system is running is often the only option that’s available.
  id: totrans-21

  zh: 正在调查的事件类型在很大程度上决定了所进行的影像类型。例如，如果分析员能够识别出从`D:`驱动器执行的潜在恶意文件，并且仅打算捕获该数据，那么获取该卷的逻辑影像可能会更快。此外，在使用**全盘加密**（**FDE**）的情况下，可能需要进行逻辑获取。没有加密密钥的情况下，在系统运行时进行文件的逻辑获取通常是唯一可用的选项。
- en: The one key drawback that a logical image has is that it will not capture unallocated
    data or data that is not part of the filesystem. Deleted files and other trace
    evidence will not be part of a logical image. In cases where an activity such
    as employee misconduct is suspected, the analyst will need to trace as much activity
    as possible, so a full image of the physical volume will be conducted. Time isn’t
    a necessary factor here.

  zh: 逻辑影像的一个关键缺点是，它不会捕获未分配的数据或不是文件系统一部分的数据。已删除的文件和其他痕迹证据不会成为逻辑影像的一部分。在怀疑如员工不当行为等活动的情况下，分析员需要尽可能追踪所有活动，因此将对物理卷进行完整影像。时间不是一个必要因素。
- en: In *Chapter 5*, we discussed the acquisition of evidence such as log files and
    running memory from a live or powered-up system. In much the same way, incident
    response analysts have the capability to obtain a logical volume from a running
    system. This technique is referred to as live imaging. Live imaging may be the
    best option if a potentially compromised system cannot be taken offline—say, in
    a **high availability** (**HA**) production server—and potential evidence is located
    within a logical volume.

- en: Dead imaging is performed on a system that has been powered down and the hard
    drive removed. In this type of imaging, the analyst can capture the entire disk,

    operating system, and timestamps. Another key feature of an E01 file is the inclusion
    of a **Cyclical Redundancy Check** (**CRC**). This CRC is a file integrity verification
    that takes place after every 64 KB of data is written to the image file. The CRC
    ensures the integrity of the preceding block of data over the entire image file.

- en: The one aspect of HDDs that is of interest to digital forensic examiners is
    how data is handled. The data is written to the disk and stays within the sectors

- en: Because of how HDDs work and the potential for reconstruction of data, it is
    a good practice to create a physical disk image. This involves powering down the
    system by removing the source of power, not through the operating system shutdown.

- en: These two features mean that traditional write blockers that are used to ensure
    that no changes are made to the disk during imaging do not work, as the PCB manages

    incident response teams, the best thing to utilize as an evidence repository is
    an external USB or FireWire disk drive. This allows a degree of portability as
    incident responders may have to investigate an incident offsite or at a variety
    of locations without the benefit of a forensic laboratory.

    FireWire 硬盘驱动器。这使得具备一定的便携性，因为事件响应人员可能需要在场外或多个地点进行事件调查，而没有取证实验室的帮助。
- en: There are two tasks that need to be performed on evidence drives prior to their
    use. The first is to ensure that the repository is free of any data. Incident
    response teams should have a policy and procedure that dictate that an evidence
    drive be wiped prior to each use. This includes drives that are new in box. This
    is since a number of manufacturers ship drives with backup software or other data
    that needs to be removed prior to use.

    utilize encryption software on the forensic workstation that is utilized in the
    imaging process. This approach is limited to imaging on drives that have been
    removed from the system and imaged on dedicated systems that have the encryption
    software installed. A second option is to include encryption software on the evidence
    drive. In the previous section, an evidence drive was divided into two partitions.
    One partition was set aside for evidence files, while the second partition was
    utilized for tools such as those used for dumping memory files or imaging. In
    this scenario, the encryption software can be loaded in the tools partition, and
    the drive can be encrypted during the evidence imaging process. This limits the
    number of changes that are made to the system under investigation.

    during the examination, no changes have been made to the evidence. For example,
    the FTK Imager tool, which will be explored extensively in this chapter, ensures
    that the acquisition of digital evidence is done without any writes to the disk.

    should be familiar with, and able to perform, this function when called upon.
    The evidence that’s found on a hard drive may be critical to determining a sequence
    of events or to obtaining actual files that can aid in determining the root cause
    of an incident. This is the central reason why responders need to understand the
    fundamentals of imaging and the tools and processes involved, how to create a
    stage drive, how to use write blockers, and how to execute any of the imaging
    techniques we mentioned in this chapter. As with any process that’s performed
    in a forensic discipline, imaging should be conducted in a systematic manner in
    which all the steps are followed and properly documented. This will ensure that
    any evidence that’s obtained will be sound and admissible in a courtroom.
