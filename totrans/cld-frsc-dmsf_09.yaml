    and log sources that are integral to **Cloud Service Providers** (**CSPs**) such
    as **Amazon Web Services** (**AWS**), Azure, and **Google Cloud Platform** (**GCP**).
    As we pivot to productivity suites, it’s crucial to recognize that these platforms—namely
    Microsoft 365 and Google Workspace—are often the epicenter of organizational data
    and activity. The investigation of incidents in these environments comes with
    its own unique challenges and possibilities, as these services offer not just
    computing and storage but also extensive collaborative tools, all available through
    a **Software as a Service** (**SaaS**) model. The SaaS model, though convenient
    for organizations, means analysis will be dependent on which log sources are made
    available for investigators by the products.

    to Microsoft 365 or Google Workspace. While AWS offers a vast array of cloud infrastructure
    and platform services, it has not ventured deeply into the cloud-based office
    productivity market. Microsoft and Google, on the other hand, have a longstanding
    presence in productivity software and have naturally extended their offerings
    into the cloud. AWS has focused more on backend infrastructure (**Infrastructure
    as a Service**, or **IaaS**) and hasn’t prioritized creating a competing suite
    in this space. In this chapter, we will delve deeper into the features of Microsoft
    365 and Google Workspace, examining their integral components and the kinds of
    logs and data that are pertinent in a forensic investigation.

    provide a wide range of services designed to enable collaboration, communication,
    and seamless data management for businesses. These productivity suites are directly
    associated with their parent cloud platforms – Azure for Microsoft and GCP for
    Google – which makes them particularly relevant in the context of cloud forensics.

    security as different license levels offer varying security capabilities. For
    example, an E5 license offers advanced threat protection features such as **Threat
    Intelligence** (**TI**) and **Advanced Threat Analytics** (**ATA**), which are
    not available in lower-tier licenses such as E3 or E1\. Licenses are assigned
    at the user level, meaning that each employee can be granted access to different
    suites of tools and security features depending on their role within the organization.
    This granular approach allows companies to optimize costs while ensuring that
    employees have the appropriate level of security measures in place. For instance,
    an IT administrator might need an E5 license for its robust security features,
    while a sales representative might only need an E3 license. Choosing the right
    Microsoft 365 license is therefore not just a matter of functionality but also
    a vital consideration for implementing a layered security posture.'
