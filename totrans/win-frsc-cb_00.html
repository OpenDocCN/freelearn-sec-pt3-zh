<p>In this book, you will find a number of styles of text that distinguish between different kinds of information. Here are some examples of these styles, and an explanation of their meaning.</p>
<p>Code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, path names, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles are shown as follows: "S<span>o in our case, it's</span> <kbd>D:\Belkasoft Memory Forensics Test.</kbd>"</p>
<p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px">

</pre>
<p>New terms and important words are shown in bold. Words that you see on the screen, in menus or dialog boxes for example, appear in the text like this: "The first pane displays information about detected shadow copies, including name, <span class="packt_screen">Explorer path</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Volume path</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Created Time</span>, and so on."</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Warnings or important notes appear in a box like this.</div>
