    loop by guiding you on how to engage your prospective community. Ultimately, it
    is your customers that drive your solution by having an unfulfilled need. Don’t
    just help them to scratch that itch; help them to achieve great success. Their
    success becomes yours as well.

    value provided by continuous interaction and feedback from your end-users, executives,
    and the overall community that leverages your product to solve their problems.
    You can expect these interactions to provide invaluable insights into use cases,
    methodologies, and usage patterns that you may not have previously foreseen. The
    data acquired will fuel future features and innovations, while undoubtedly helping
    you make your product more secure in the process. This is where your customers
    return value to the cause.

    have no work to do. I will be setting some challenges for you and your team. How
    you address these challenges could determine the overall success or grievous failure
    of your project. So, without further ado, let’s take those final steps and close
    the CI/CD loop together.

    – back in [*Chapter 2*](B22104_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor044). But we just scratched
    the surface. What you’re going to find in this chapter will be far more… prescriptive.
    A significant part of this chapter will be the flip side of the coin of what I
    have previously mentioned about engagement.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This will not be redundant. Previously, I tasked you with engaging more with
    your customers. That is assumed by now. In this chapter, where we are closing
    the entire CI/CD loop, I am challenging YOU to take the steps beyond basic engagement.
    In fact, I am recommending that you and your team create your own specific engagement
    methods with your prospective customer base and, more so, create a community.
    In other words, don’t just join a community – build and lead one!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Here, I am tasking you with truly getting actual information, research, and
    guidance from those who shall become your customer base. These people are the
    truest key to getting you to a spot where you can actually define what your future
    product must do and what security implications must be adhered to, as well as
    understanding what features they want versus must have.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Use cases themselves will determine how your future user base will leverage
    your solution. How they consume the services that your appliance provides will
    drive security measures that must be planned for (UI, user-level access, tamper-proofing,
    etc.). How you get this information is the challenge this chapter is dedicated
    to solving.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Additionally, feedback from your users could potentially identify security concerns
    or missing security measures that your team might not have incorporated into that
    release of the appliance. Encouraging open feedback with your users is a great
    source of product improvement recommendations – always. Ignore their feedback
    at your own peril.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Earlier in this book, in [*Chapter 11*](B22104_11.xhtml#_idTextAnchor339), I
    suggested that you get involved in security community user groups. I am not deviating
    from that recommendation. This section is not remotely about that. Here, I am
    challenging you to find the highest concentration of what could be your user base
    and create a user group in that area.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This user group will be focused on your product, how it’s used, its future,
    and what they need you to maintain or improve. Create your own community for your
    products. I cannot emphasize how important this is. The feedback you get from
    these people will be crucial to the success of your products. If the user base
    doesn’t believe you are progressing in the correct direction, they might just
    abandon your product.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Learning exactly how your products are deployed and consumed might surprise
    you. You might find out they are not being used as intended. That in itself could
    impact the security and integrity of your product. Conversely, you could also
    come to the conclusion that a function or security precaution may have been overlooked.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You might even get excellent insight from your users on not only how to make
    their experiences more pleasurable and efficient but also what features could
    set your product apart from others. Never underestimate the gems user groups could
    reveal.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: How you engage these people will alter how they perceive your product and, ultimately,
    how they perceive your company as a whole. Engage, be open, and, most of all,
    open your ears to their thoughts and concerns. These interactions are priceless
    opportunities to establish trust with your user base by not only letting their
    voices be heard but also reinforcing that their opinions matter. When they know
    their opinions matter, they feel like part of the solution themselves and more
    like a community, rather than just a customer to a vendor.

    away. These groups work best when your users can interact with product management
    and engineers. *Techies talking to techies* – this works best.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Here is a recommendation. Near the end of your first few meetings, query the
    audience on their thoughts on the meeting cadence, content they’d like to be covered
    in future sessions, and the duration of the gatherings (are they too long, too
    short, or just right?).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One thing I have always found engaging and that leads to success is asking people
    in the audience to openly share their thoughts on a recent experience that they
    have had with the product, whether positive or negative. Nothing should be formal.
    This is a great way to encourage attendees to become more engaged.
  prefs: []

    is to encourage customers and partners to be part of the agenda. Presentations,
    demos, or just a quick lightning talk performed by either a customer or a partner
    go a great way toward building your community and securing trust. Let them talk
    about the good, the bad, and the ugly, along with HOW they solved a problem and
    the product added value to their organization.

    provide significant insights into usage patterns, creating meaningful relationships

    conduit for your customers to help you drive innovation and greater usability
    and security in your product.

    can drive the rapid adoption of your product. Moreso, they can provide your team
    with crucial insights into how implementation and integration operations are actually

    Earlier in the book, specifically [*Chapter 11*](B22104_11.xhtml#_idTextAnchor339),
    I challenged you to get involved within the Linux and security communities. Here,
    I am outright challenging you to create your own community.'

    find a way to share information informally. These information-sharing activities
    may start on message boards and evolve naturally into informal groups.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is your greatest opportunity to shape the evolving community. Host message
    boards. Create a user group somewhere where there is a high concentration of your
    users. This might mean creating several unique group meeting environments across
    multiple geographic regions or cities. Start small where the largest concentration
    of your users exists and get feedback from them when you decide to expand and
    create new groups in other locations.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You likely won’t be able to address all pockets of users across the globe. You
    can keep your users engaged with newsletters and surveys. Never expect a 100%
    response rate to surveys unless something bad has occurred with your product.
    But these communications are no substitute for direct interactions. The goal here
    is not simply continuous engagement (which does have some value) but hopefully
    to encourage a user base to further become a community by having their voices
    heard and keeping them informed. My personal opinion is that you can actually
    engage too much. Don’t be like a certain unnamed online vendor that asks you to
    complete a survey for every order. Make your interactions add value to the recipient
    or do not interact at all.
  prefs: []

- en: This is where I recommend hosting events. The target audience for these is everyone.
    Possible customers, partners, users, executives, and industry-focused media are
    all your desired targets. Each will provide their own opinions and input. These
    events can be made up of multiple simultaneous sessions, with different target
    audiences all at the same time. Product information, training, and panel-based
    Q&A sessions are the kings here.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Ultimately, I am not speaking about how to market your product here. So many
    others could do a much better job at discussing that than I could. My point to
    all of this is to get and stay engaged with your community as a whole and to make
    it grow positively. Knowing their needs and then addressing them in your solution
    will continue to drive success and help you achieve a more secure product in the
    process.

- en: We’ve arrived at the end of the trail now. This final chapter has touched on
    critical aspects of how to gather and ingest feedback from outside your organization.
    These efforts, often running in parallel to each other, will altogether give your
    team a virtual weather report of sorts as to exactly how your product is received
    and perceived and what changes you can make to make gains in security and adoption.
    They are also a great indication of what the community feels your product got
    right and you should sustain in future releases... Take these golden nuggets for
    what they are – an amazing level of insight that you didn’t have to pay industry
    analysts for.

    a progression of knowledge that you can apply to your projects regardless of the

    together.

    an embedded Linux system appliance is, who uses it, and how compliance efforts
    drive the overall solution, starting with the selection of the hardware and operating

    and replaced it with practical application.

    tools you might need to implement within your build chain, followed by some very

    your solution from the end-users themselves.

    and Continuous Improvement* – we addressed how one can create a sustainable CI/CD
    chain that doesn’t just automate builds and tests. To have the most perfect loop,
    there must also be human inputs and outputs of this chain. That means you need
    to create a community for your product/project. The care and feeding of this community
    are as important as the level of attention and due diligence that you give your
    product.
