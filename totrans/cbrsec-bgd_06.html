                    <h1 class="header-title">Understanding Reactive, Proactive, and Operational Security</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Cybersecurity is gaining importance due to the increased number of cyberattacks and the huge losses that victims are reporting. In many organizations, however, the implementation of cybersecurity comes as a consequence of a threat or an attack. Organizations can decide to mount reactive, proactive, and operational cyber defenses, or a combination of the three depending on financial capabilities and levels of exposure to threats. This chapter will go through the three types of approaches to implementing cybersecurity and help you to choose the optimal one for your company.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Proactive cyber defense</li>
<li>Reactive cybersecurity</li>
<li>Operational security</li>
<li>The significance of the three pillars of security</li>
</ul>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Proactive cyber defense</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Proactive cyber defense is focused on anticipating attacks and offensively protecting the targets (computers, systems, and networks) whenever an attack is launched. The intention is to aggressively disrupt the attack or the preparation for an attack by the threat vector. This renders the attack vector less effective, or capable of being repulsed with ease. Proactive cyber defense is arguably the best implementation of cybersecurity even though many organizations do not give it much thought. This approach foresees oncoming attacks and readies an arsenal of defense systems and strategies to disrupt these attacks or make them ineffective. Company assets are therefore seldom put at risk since the threat does not come into contact with them. Despite these advantages, many organizations opt to remain reactive or use operation cybersecurity due to a number of reasons, which we will outline next.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Small and medium-sized enterprises</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs) tend to be thinly stretched in terms of finances and thus will not easily adopt proactive security as it is expensive to maintain. Understandably, they do not want to allocate resources that could mean other operations will suffer.</p>
<p>SMEs are also put off the implementation of some cybersecurity measures in favor of their business operations. Since proactive cybersecurity is quite involved and often needs immediate action to avert possible attacks, it can be seen as bothersome and inconvenient by SMEs. They want a cybersecurity strategy that bends to their schedule and not the other way round.</p>
<p>SMEs are also known to be quite slow in seeking professional help for their cybersecurity concerns. They will give priority to off-the-shelf security systems if they have decent reviews. However, in the changing cybersecurity scene, where tech giants such as Facebook are becoming victims, it is no longer safe to just deploy security systems without understanding the threat landscape and what needs to be covered.</p>
<p>Lastly, SMEs have long been reactive to cyberattacks and thus will shun proactive security strategies. They will only intensify their security after they fall prey to an attack.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Large organizations</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Large corporations often feel they are too big to be effectively managed by a proactive security strategy. Since proactive security takes control of the whole organization, there are many areas that it cannot cover. For instance, all employees might not be trained about a certain attack before it happens.</p>
<p>In addition, large companies are usually concerned about their reputation. Proactive security adds extra eyes and ears that might eventually expose threats that face the organization. Moreover, some measures, such as an urgent request for all employees to undertake a certain training, might go out in a negative light to show that the company is under attack.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Worrying attack trends</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Symantec, a leading cybersecurity products company, released a report on the advanced cyberattack techniques that had maximum effectiveness on targets. They are as listed as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Deploying legitimate software on attacked computers</strong>: To prevent discovery by antivirus programs and still keep tabs on attacked computers, cyberattackers will install seemingly legitimate software. After the removal of the malware that caused an attack, the antivirus tools would not remove the legitimate software, thus leaving the computer under the eye of attackers.</li>
<li><strong>Using company resources to move stolen assets</strong>: To stick around after an attack, cybercriminals will use company resources to move around any stolen intellectual property without arousing suspicion. Therefore, instead of directly uploading information assets to their servers, they create fake communication through which the data is sent to a compromised email that they control.</li>
<li><strong>Building more attack tools within the victim's network or servers</strong>: Instead of using prepackaged attacks, some cyber attackers assemble their attack tools within the victim. This was especially effective for organizations that had firewalls that could thwart the entry of malware tools into the organization's network.</li>
<li><strong>Spear-phishing employees using corporate accounts</strong>: Another tactic that was discovered was the use of hacked corporate emails to target other employees. These would have higher rates of success than spoofed emails.</li>
</ul>
<p>These tactics were a few among many that cannot be easily stopped by reactive or operational security. The attacks were built specifically to beat these two conventional security strategies. Proactive security identifies these and many other preeminent attacks and works to make them ineffective or less effective to the organization. The following are the key areas that proactive security puts a focus on:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Asset management</strong>: In this security approach, all the devices in the organization have to be known. Therefore, there should be an updated register of all the devices connected to the network and sufficient details to determine their users or functions.</li>
<li><strong>Software inventory</strong>: To prevent the installation of malicious or unwanted programs, proactive security includes taking an inventory of the software that users are allowed to run on their computers and mobile devices, as well as the software in servers.</li>
<li><strong>Hardware and software configuration</strong>: The configurations in devices and software should be validated and updated as needed, to ensure that they do not expose the company to threats.</li>
<li><strong>Vulnerability assessment</strong>: The threats that an organization is exposed to should be known. In addition, their risk and impacts must also be determined.</li>
<li><strong>Malware security</strong>: There should be tools that can offer antivirus protection to the organization.</li>
<li><strong>Employee training</strong>: Since attackers have been targeting employees through phishing scams and social engineering, proactive defense includes training employees on common phishing or social engineering attacks and how they can guard against cyberattacks.</li>
</ul>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Implementing proactive security</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>As you can see, despite being an effective method, proactive security might not be the first choice for many organizations. However, with the changing dynamics of cyberattacks, proactive security will perhaps become the go-to methodology in the coming years. In this section, we'll look into the various aspects of implementing proactive security. The following are some elements that need to be taken into account when formulating a proactive security strategy.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Vulnerability assessment</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>This involves scanning organizational networks, devices, and systems to discover their vulnerabilities. The scans are ideally done both outside and within the organization's network to give a well-rounded report. The identified threats must then be mediated to prevent possible exploitation.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Penetration testing</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>This involves authorizing penetration tests against a company's internal and external IT infrastructure to further identify any flaws that hackers might use to attack a company. Penetration tests take the form of actual attacks and can thus be viewed as replicas of how a hacker would try to breach an organization and thus how they can be denied the chance to do so. Penetration tests normally include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Network reconnaissance</strong>: All the computers within a specified scope are detected, the OS and services of these computers are then determined. In addition, DNS records are obtained to further identify the systems running on the network.</li>
<li><strong>Enumeration</strong>: The next step is to determine the versions of the OS and services in each computer. The services can also be probed to help determine their configurations.</li>
<li><strong>Exploitation</strong>: Any flaws and vulnerabilities in the services running on the network are identified. Exploitation tools and techniques are then used to attack the services. For instance, the firewall could be running a service that cannot handle traffic past a certain limit. A botnet can thus be used to flood the firewall with traffic past its limits.</li>
<li><strong>Validation</strong>: After successful exploitation, the vulnerability is validated and prioritized for mitigation.</li>
</ul>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Social-engineering assessment</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>This is aimed at ensuring that employees are ready to face social-engineering attacks without yielding to the tricks and gimmicks used by cyber criminals.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Web-application security assessment</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>This assessment focuses on the vulnerabilities in apps that are commonly exploited by hackers. Organizations must test both the threats and the impacts of a successful breach to a web app. Upon discovery of the threats, the app should be patched or put offline to prevent hackers from using them as attack surfaces. In addition, the impact of successful intrusions should be determined to help the organization further increase its security layers. For instance, the impacts of a successful breach past the login interface can be mitigated by having only the less valuable data exposed to hackers. Sensitive data could be moved to a layer with a higher level of security using techniques such as encryption.</p>
<p>In summary, proactive security includes all the techniques that can prevent an attack from happening in the first place. This approach is taken by companies that anticipate potentially negative situations and cannot risk their reputation.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Reactive cybersecurity</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>It may not always be possible to foresee oncoming attacks. In addition, it might be expensive for some companies to keep so many threat-monitoring tools running if the organization seldom gets attacked. Reactive security is an approach that, instead of anticipating cybersecurity incidences, responds to the past or present threats after they have happened. Therefore, only when an organization is targeted by hackers and breached does reactive security kick in. Using this approach, the victim organization assesses the threat and the impacts the cyberattack had. Using this information, security measures are installed to prevent similar attacks in the future.</p>
<p>The reactive security strategy makes financial and business sense to many business executives, and that is why many organizations are stuck in it. The executives are mostly focused on reducing expenses and maximizing profits. In addition, business requirements, threats, and many other factors continually change. Therefore, it becomes quite expensive to deploy proactive security measures that are mostly based on assumptions of the threats that could happen in the future. The reality is that the threats will change and so will the business. For instance, a business that relies on a locally hosted website to make sales might choose to to adopt a cloud app. Security in the cloud is offered by the vendor and thus the company will hardly need to focus on it. If they had a proactive security strategy, they might be at a loss since the expensive tools or services acquired to predict and protect the website will no longer be required. With a reactive security strategy, the business will not feel a pinch since the strategy welcomes these changes.</p>
<p>To achieve minimal wastage of resources, many organizations consider this security strategy. It is also more conventional since it deals with cybersecurity incidents once they happen. The business is put in a position where it dictates the security infrastructure. Since it is normally problematic for IT leaders to calculate the return on cybersecurity investments, this strategy gives management a better picture of the amount to spend. The amount is determined based on the attacks that the organization is targeted with. The strategy is also simple for management to understand. There is a cause-effect relationship. The occurrence of a cybersecurity incidence necessitates spending on IT security. This is easier for business executives to understand as compared to the proactive strategy where the security investments are done to invisible attacks that might never happen.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Implementing a reactive security strategy</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Since the strategy is based on the occurrence of an attack for a response to be initiated, there has to be a highly efficient monitoring system. In addition, since the occurrence of an attack might lead to a loss of services, the strategy must also have a highly functional backup and disaster-recovery element. To prevent future similar attacks, organizations need to understand what caused the previous attacks. This strategy, therefore, must include forensics investigations. The following is how all these components are implemented in the organization.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Monitoring</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Instead of having active defenses to prevent the occurrence of an attack, organizations use highly effective monitoring tools to be on the lookout for suspicious activities on computers, systems, and networks. When suspicious behaviors or attacks are detected, alerts are sent out so that the appropriate response can be taken. For instance, an organization might install an intrusion-detection system on its network to be on the lookout for reconnaissance scans, illegitimate traffic, malware, and other types of threats. When it detects the threats, it might notify the IT department or an integrated security tool to counter these threats.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Response</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The type of response depends on the threat and the extent of the attack. If the attack is ongoing, the response will focus on stopping the attack. For instance, if there is a lot of illegitimate traffic directed toward a certain server, the IT department might opt to take the server offline or reconfigure its IP address so that the attacks no longer reach it. If the attack is a breach to a system, the IT team might change the access credentials and kill all sessions, thus forcing the attackers out of the system. An attack that has already happened will elicit a different type of response. The IT team has to prevent repeat attacks or the spread of malware from the victim. Therefore, if a server was targeted, it might be disconnected from the network and isolated physically. If a system faced a brute-force attack and the login system was compromised, the login module could be temporarily taken out to prevent further attacks. The steps taken to respond to the attack can affect the impacts. However, the organization still needs to ensure that its clients are not adversely affected, hence the following measure is taken.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Disaster-recovery</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The reactive security strategy is heavily reliant on the organization's ability to bounce back after an attack. Disaster-recovery plans are therefore the key components of the strategy. The priorities in disaster-recovery might differ depending on the organization and the type of attack that occurred. There are five main components that are given attention during disaster-recovery: computers, hardware, network, software, and data. They are elaborated upon here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Computers refer to the workstations and servers in a network. After an attack has happened, they need to be checked upon to determine whether they were affected. Enterprise antivirus systems can be used to initiate simultaneous scans to help with this. The hardware refers to any computing hardware in the organization, such as network routers, desktops, firewalls, and computer peripherals. Cybersecurity incidences still include physical theft or destruction of these hardware. Therefore, if a physical attack has happened, it is necessary to determine that all hardware is still in place and to replace any sensitive hardware that has been compromised or stolen. For instance, if a router has been stolen or destroyed, a replacement should be installed. Similarly, servers running sensitive systems should be replaced if they have been destroyed or stolen.</li>
<li>The network includes all forms of connectivity in the network. If, for instance, the wireless network has been breached, it is prudent for its SSID or password to be changed, hence forcing out the hackers. If the connection to the service provider has been compromised, a backup service provider should be engaged. This will ensure that the organization does not remain offline.</li>
<li>Software includes both the operating systems and the applications that normally run in an organization. Some attackers will have tools that can attack a specific version of software. Therefore, when an attack occurs, the organization should consider updating to the latest OS versions. These versions will come with patches that will prevent similar attacks from recurring. In addition, some hackers might misconfigure some software. For instance, they might reconfigure the router to sabotage communication. Therefore, in such cases, the software needs to be configured to the correct settings. In the cases where the attacked software is infected with malware, the IT team can uninstall it and provide alternatives to keep the organization going.</li>
<li>The data is arguably the most important digital asset, thus it should be prioritized in disaster-recovery. If mission-critical data has been modified or stolen, the IT team should reinstate the most recent backup to roll back the changes made or to make the data available to users that need it. Due to the vulnerability of data, the IT team must also ensure that, before restoration, the relevant systems are free from malware or a backdoor that can be used by attackers to gain unauthorized access to the data.</li>
</ul>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Forensic investigations</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The reactive security strategy is aimed at ensuring that attacks are not repeated. Therefore, their causes must be fully known and any factors that mediated the success of the attack should be identified. For instance, a system breach might occur simply because of the use of default passwords by system admins. The forensic investigations will uncover that the attack was a breach past the login controls and it was mediated by the use of the default credentials. The organization will thus have a full picture and implement better security controls to prevent the same attack from reoccurring. For instance, in this case, the organization might opt to implement two-factor authentication and create a security policy that bars system admins from using default passwords. By the end of the forensic investigations, the organization should know all the mitigation measures it must take to secure itself.</p>
<p>In some cases, forensic investigations are coupled with retrieval efforts. For instance, if money has been stolen, the forensics might include tracing back the money trails to find out where it has been sent. There have been some real-life cases where money was stolen by cybercriminals and recovered by forensic investigators. Ubiquity networks is one of these organizations where $40,000,000 was stolen through social engineering and forensic investigations were able to trace and recover $8,000,000. Besides money, forensic investigations can recover data. Most of the stolen data ends up on dark-web markets. Forensic investigators can scour the dark-web markets for new listings of certain types of data. They can then pose as buyers and retrieve the data from the hackers before it is sold to other people.</p>
<p>In conclusion, it is not always economically feasible for an organization to adopt proactive security. Most organizations use the reactive cybersecurity strategy due to its simplicity and appeal to business executives. The reactive approach is designed to only act when a substantial threat is detected or an attack has happened. The approach seeks to stop the attacks and prevent excessive damage to the company's assets. The strategy covers computers, hardware, software, network, and data. It has four key steps: monitoring, response, disaster-recovery, and forensic investigations. These steps work hand in hand to ensure that the organization survives the cyberattacks with minimal impacts on its business operations and that the causes of the security attacks are identified and mitigated to prevent future attacks.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Overview of operational security</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Operational security is often regarded as the convergence point of operational risks and cybersecurity. It is the middle ground between proactive and reactive security. This approach to cybersecurity addresses the conflicting business and security needs that organizations usually face. Business executives will want to manage cybersecurity from the top down so that it aligns with other business processes. However, they lack the technical knowledge to connect cybersecurity and business processes. For instance, they could know the basics of firewalls and antivirus programs, but they cannot tell how these tools connect with their business processes and employees. To the executives, it is just a matter of having cybersecurity tools.</p>
<p>However, the reality is much different. Cybersecurity is not about having two or three security tools, it is about safeguarding the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data. Business executives will understandably lack the knowledge of all the security tools or measures required to safeguard the CIA triad of information. They will just know the few tools they are familiar with and assume that cybersecurity spending only revolves around those tools.</p>
<p>Cybersecurity is complex and highly technical since it must involve the entirety of the organization. It involves the people, processes, devices, and services within the given organization; all business operations are part of cybersecurity.</p>
<p>The operational security approach stitches together the organization's processes with cybersecurity. This, therefore, deters operational risks that might threaten the business. There are many operational cybersecurity risks that organizations are exposed to daily. For instance, there are conventional IT risks, such as unauthorized access to data, denial-of-service attacks, and social engineering. In addition, legal risks emanate from the regulations surrounding IT operations, such as the collection, storage, and sharing of data. Thirdly, there are third-party risks that come from vendors and suppliers. These are just a few of the many operational risks that face an organization and must be handled to prevent the risk of data loss, lawsuits, and reputation. The operational security strategy covers all these risks using a clever implementation plan, which we'll discuss next.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Implementing operation security</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Operational security is divided into three lines of defense: risk management, cybersecurity management, and audits:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The first line of defense is risk management.</strong> Here, the different risks that affect a business' operations are handled. In this line, the key focus is risk analysis and management. The different risks across the scope of the business have to be identified. The key risk indicators for each of these risks have to be established. The probability of the occurrence of each of these risks then has to be determined. This has to be followed by the assessment of the severity of the occurrence of each risk. Using this information, the operational risks can be ranked or tabulated in a matrix to determine the priority of solving them.</li>
<li><strong>The second line of defense is cybersecurity management.</strong> This includes all the processes involved in securing the organization from the operational risks identified by the first line. The second line of defense starts with security policies. These help mitigate the introduction of risks into the business. This is followed by the definition of key risk indicators. These definitions help to alert the IT team when a risk event has occurred. The definition of key risk indicators is followed by cybersecurity standards. The standards outline the execution of different cybersecurity strategies to mitigate or prevent the defined risks from happening. The second line of defense ends with cybersecurity-management tools, which are used to view the cybersecurity stature of the organization.</li>
<li><strong>The last line of defense in operation security is auditing.</strong> There are two types of auditing: internal and external. This line of defense ensures that all the other lines of defense have been correctly implemented. It also helps identify areas of weakness in the security strategy.</li>

                    <h1 class="header-title">The significance of the three security pillars</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Organizations have varying needs, risk exposures, and access to resources. Cybersecurity, however, is a cross-cutting concern and any organization can be a target or a victim. This chapter has gone through the three security strategies that organizations can deploy in their organizations. While they can function independently, the strategies work best when intertwined. They are complementary in nature and can offer organizations protection from multiple fronts.</p>
<p>The proactive security approach ensures that very few attacks manage to hit the organization. It is focused on predicting and neutralizing threats, and hardening attack surfaces so that it is difficult for an attacker to penetrate the organizational network or systems. The reactive security approach is the contrast of proactive security. The reactive security approach works by responding to threats only when they happen. Therefore, a lot more time and resources are spent on core business objectives instead of cybersecurity. The reactive security approach ensures that, whenever an attack happens, the organization is able to recover and can identify the causal factors and seal them to prevent future attacks. In addition, reactive security involves possible tracking and recovery of stolen assets from the organization. The operational security approach works with people and processes. It identifies the risks that can be met during business operations and then creates security solutions to prevent any adverse effects of these risks. In addition, it ensures that the organization is regularly audited to detect any weaknesses in the security strategy.</p>
<p>The three security strategies, when combined, act as pillars to form a formidable defense from attacks. They also offer multiple layers of security, with proactive security preventing most attacks from occurring, operational security guarding business operations against the attacks, and reactive security ensuring that the business is resilient enough to survive the attack and form future defenses against similar attacks. Of importance during the consideration of the security strategies are the business, needs, exposure to cybersecurity threats, and available resources. Each of the strategies can fit different organizations to varying degrees depending on these three factors.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Security operations and continuous monitoring</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Security monitoring is an integral process in cybersecurity. Security monitoring provides any organization with the ability to detect and analyze events from the enterprise network, applications, endpoints, and user activities. Typically, <strong>security operations and continuous monitoring</strong> (<strong>SOC</strong>) has three elements: <strong>people</strong>, <strong>process</strong>, and <strong>technology</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Technology</strong> helps drive the monitoring of assets, such as networks, applications, endpoints, servers, web applications, and generates alerts by automatic correlation and analysis:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/5777a937-3ba5-4086-a16e-9a190c3675fa.jpg" style="width:55.25em;height:39.33em;"/></p>
<p>A photo from a Microsoft SOC</p>
<p>The <strong>people</strong> component in SOC focuses on validating these alerts manually and categorizing them.</p>
<p>The <strong>process</strong> component is all about analyzing the alerts/logs and either identifies a threat and provides detailed information to the remediation team or marks it as false positive:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/17de0f20-92a3-44b2-b802-cb7e20183b65.png" style="width:41.83em;height:42.83em;"/></p>
<p>SOC also has to align its purpose with the business goals and vision of the organization. SOC needs to build its monitoring strategy to fulfill the business needs. SOC in general is a 24/7 operation, and this is by design so that SOC analysts, proper processes, and the detection technologies can help to reduce the gap between time to detection versus when the attack happened by processing data from internal corporate sources and correlating them with the known threat information from a wide range of external sources. With enriched and actionable threat intelligence, advanced analytics capabilities, data contextualization, and the right skills in place, an SOC can also act proactively to deter and stop attacks. An SOC always relies on intelligence, such as malware data, indicators of compromise and attack information, and threat and vulnerability reports by security vendors and application vendors. Modern SOCs need to embrace security automation and machine learning to reach the highest level of maturity. Other than the core technology of SIEM, threat-intelligence feeds, and various data feeds, SOC can leverage technologies such as intrusion-detection tools, antivirus integrations, DLP feeds, workflows, and reporting tools. SOC can be achieved in three different ways: captive SOC or self-managed SOC, co-managed SOC, and fully managed SOC by a third party.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Captive SOC (self-managed SOC)</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Captive SOC is security monitoring that is managed in-house, with their own talents or trained resources. Captive SOC is run from a premise or facility that is fully controlled by the organization itself. In this scenario, the organization fully owns the responsibility of choosing their own SIEM tool, managing the tool, and running the operations, they also are responsible for training their analysts to staying up to date.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Co-managed SOC</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>When you are not in a position to have a self-managed SOC, the second option is to have a co-managed SOC. In a co-managed SOC model scenario, you are partnering with another service provider to share your workload, technology, or the operational overload. In this model, you can optimize your operations by offloading some of the responsibilities to the SOC service vendor, for example you may choose to monitor the daytime shift, and let the vendor manage the night shifts, you can have the SIEM owned by the vendor and have your resources manage the operations, or you can own the SIEM and offload the operations to a vendor. In a co-managed way of running SOC, you have the opportunity to be more agile and maintain a high level of operational excellence by applying service-level agreements on the vendor and bring up the SOC in less time than is required in a fully owned SOC; you almost tap into a matured operating SOC. One of the other factors that will work in your favor is that you will be able to almost immediately tap into the resource skill pool of your vendor, should you lose your own, or in the case of vendor-managed analysts, you never have to worry about losing a talent, as they will maintain the pool. If you choose a service provider that has a well-trained and experienced analyst pool, this automatically benefits your security operations. On the other hand, if you choose to co-manage the SIEM, you can share the cost of the license, maintenance, and operations. This eases your business to some extent, but not completely, as you might still be responsible for the incident response and analysis with shared resources between you and the vendor, manage the governance from your end, and also own the risk management of your business, monitor the SLAs with the vendor, and monitor the quality of service from the vendor so that the quality of detection and operation is not degraded. The following diagram shows the layers in a co-managed SOC:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/067eadcb-4275-4e8a-93f1-33e56f0c7de8.png" style="width:28.17em;height:14.17em;"/></p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Fully managed SOC</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Fully managed SOC has been the talk of the industry for a few years now. This model of operations provides you with the ability to outsource or offload the entire SOC process to a third-party vendor, with full access to its trained resources, SIEM and detection technologies, and proven processes. Your SOC gets a boost from 0 to 100 in no time. Organizations will usually send all the telemetry, visibility data, and logs to the vendor-managed SOC data centers, from where the <strong>managed security service provider</strong> (<strong>MSSP</strong>) will analyze the data for security incidents/events. The benefit of an MSSP is higher than the other two models, because you as an organization will almost immediately get access to a matured SOC. An outcome-based result can be expected from MSSP, providing highly accurate detection and response, with advanced level-detection and response technologies. MSSPs have a very experienced and skilled pool of staff to monitor, analyze, and investigate. Scalability and crisis management is another benefit of a fully managed SOC, where you don't have to worry about whether you need to monitor more devices or applications for any reason, or if there is a major incident and you might need additional resources to help through that situation. MSSPs normally have affiliations and access to agencies and vendors who provide highly enriched and actionable threat data that is relevant to your business, which is crucial for advanced detection capabilities. One other benefit of having a fully managed SOC is the industry-level visibility and threat data sharing; if another attack is noticed with another customer of a similar type, that attack information and threat intelligence is almost immediately available to you as an advisory and within the detection infrastructure. In general, MSSP vendors will have access to large data centers for storage and retention for you to take advantage of it. The only part that you may still have to own is the governance of your SOC and remediation of threat in case of an attack. The current MSSP model is the most popular SOC model.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Proactive versus reactive security</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The range of cyberattacks and their sophistication is on the rise today. All the attacks in recent days were successful in bypassing the existing security solutions, traditional or advanced. These attacks were successful because they were able to hide within the legitimate realm of our network and infrastructure. Our current security solutions are designed to detect based on scanning for known issues, filtering or dropping bad things, or even trying to monitor the identity and user habits, but these are not able to deter the attacks. The primary reason is that these are still focused on reacting to the security event, responding to the security findings of the security events that happened, and planning for how to recover from them. In other words: a reactive security response. A reactive response is good, but it is not holding the ground to a level where it can compete with the advanced attacks of these days. We need to have the focus redirected toward a proactive security response. The industry is already moving from a reactive to a proactive security response. This is a paradigm shift in security framework and methodologies on how we predict, analyze and respond to threats. Unlike reactive forms of security response, proactive methodologies provide greater and more in-depth visibility into the attack infrastructure. In simple words, the proactive method looks at the attacker's view of the attack surface and tries to predict the attacks and apply proper measures to prevent them.</p>
<p>As the logic goes, the reactive model of security response is the mindset of, <em>"If and when there is an attack, the systems and security analysts will respond to it."</em> It's about laying a trap with known attack parameters and methods, and waiting for the monitoring and detection systems to react to it. In the reactive form, the attention is always given to forming a strong perimeter defense to thwart the attacks that will attempt to penetrate the network. This form of security is localized toward the particular business unit and its activities; it does not take advantage of the attacks of a similar nature against another business or industry verticals. Reactive security does not provide a 360-degree view of the threat landscape but a reactive way of achieving security operations is always simpler, faster to bring up and with less operational cost. The reactive way of security monitoring can be further enhanced with data feeds from antivirus detection systems, vulnerability scanners, and DLP systems. The flip side of such a model is that it will always react to the security detection after the breach or compromise has happened.</p>
<p>The proactive way of security monitoring and response wins here. It is an intelligence-driven model, where the system is enriched with actionable intelligence data, from multiple internal and external sources, working in line with the existing real-time monitoring systems. This proactive method will have visibility to the entire threat landscape and all phases of the cyber-kill chain, and not just focusing on one or partial phases of the kill chain. One of the key aspects of proactive security is threat hunting, which allows analysts to get more insight into the network and systems, by trying to uncover anomalies or any abnormal patterns in the network behavior, any known bad files in the systems, or registry entries that can be found from previously known attacks. As an analyst, you can also look for known <strong>indicators of compromise</strong> (<strong>IOCs</strong>) in the network to find any signs of compromise. Threat hunting is a continuous process and always tries to look for new sets of information as received from threat-intelligence sources. Threat hunting can also be done automatically by looking into network behavior, system anomalies, timeline analysis of certain events, and baseline data of the network and system for a period of time.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">The threat intelligence system and its importance</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Every organization is extremely worried about the data they hold and how to secure it. The sensitivity toward data is at an all-time peak. In our effort to keep data safe and be proactive in detecting any threat toward it, we must have proper and effective threat intelligence in place. Threat intelligence can be achieved by acquiring specific threat information (intelligence) about various systems, processes, network, applications, perimeter defense mechanisms, and other IT assets. This data is then collected, analyzed, and enriched to provide proactive and actionable threat intelligence. One of the reasons threat intelligence is so important is because the threats of the current generation are highly sophisticated, and difficult to detect. We must acquire very specific information and perform a search for the signs of compromise with actionable content from any threat-intel source. To stay ahead of advanced threats, it is essential that we feed our analytic and correlation systems with proper threat data.</p>
<p>Any effective and matured threat-intelligence system must be able to collect and categorize threat information in real time to produce actionable threat intelligence for the SIEM and incident-response systems to analyze and correlate the collected threat information with the security alerts and events they are monitoring. These threat alerts from the threat-intel system will also empower the SOC professionals to create custom signatures for further detection. Threat intelligence systems gather various information related to incidents, events and logs, security vulnerabilities, and recent and past attack data. This includes detection data from security and network devices of the organization along with information from external threat feeds. You can also set up a honeypot system to collect attack information and use it as threat data. Data collection needs to be focused and meaningful for the organization that intends to use it, because every business is different, with distinct needs and types of infrastructure. Threat intelligence collection and feed need to suit each business. Non-relevant intelligence data will lead to wrong assumptions, so the potential to miss the attack or compromise is greater. For the threat intelligence to be effective, the collection of intelligence data must be done in a centralized manner, as the systems collects threat and vulnerability information from a wide range of locations and devices to correlate data. You must collect data from both internal and external sources, as combined they will provide more detailed information on threats and attack vectors specific to your industry or organization. Also focus on collecting information about any ongoing global attack and its attack vectors, related mitigation instructions and detection parameters from agencies such as government CERT, NIST, and ENISA, along with industry sources, such as Cisco, Symantec, McAfee, Microsoft, and RSA. You may also focus on open source threat intel, such as OSINT, SANS Internet Storm Center, and Open Threat Exchange. All this collected threat information needs to be properly categorized and segregated based on threat types, and its importance to the business entity and function. It can, for example, be based on the geolocation of the business unit, business applications you are using, and IT infrastructures. Geolocation is important for identifying where the threat originated from so that you can focus on those business locations of yours as priority as they may have been affected; this could also help establish whether it is a targeted attack toward your organization or not or maybe towards a country. This scenario can help you pinpoint the most affected business function, application, or unit, and gives you room for remediation in advance or at least on time, before it's too late. It will also help you to define proper mitigation and detection strategies, allowing you to focus on effectively using your resources, as they are always limited regardless of the size of the organization.</p>
<p>A successful and matured threat-intelligence system must be able to generate and distribute reports about all of their findings and related investigations to help others involved in the security protection, investigation, and monitoring process to carry out their necessary work at various levels of operations, engineering, and strategic decision-making by governance bodies. Reporting can be via real-time methods or by publishing online advisories. The Security Threat Intelligence Advisory might also be shared among industry peers via threat-exchange mechanisms such as STIX or Traffic Light Protocol, for everyone to take advantage of and stay ahead of any attacks.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Digital forensics and real-time incident response with SIEM</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>As we have witnessed the rise in cyberattacks in the past few years, we are convinced that prevention and monitoring are just the initial steps toward being prepared against any cybersecurity attacks. What we should do is develop more capabilities toward threat hunting, internal threat intelligence, and strong incident response empowered with digital forensics investigation.</p>
<p>Most of the organizations in the industry today are already using SIEM as their primary and central monitoring platform. Traditionally, we have been using SIEM as a platform that receives information from the rest of the network, as mentioned earlier in this chapter, to correlate and identify threats and security incidents. In essence, SIEM has always acted like a device that listened and didn't say a word. In today's cybersecurity scenario, it is prudent for SIEM to take a much larger role in the whole process to say things and collaborate in taking actions. One prominent activity that SIEM can be tasked with is to integrate with Digital Forensic platforms to receive richer and more tactical information in real-time. The digital evidence is extremely volatile, and this drives the response time for any security incident. The fragile and crucial nature of digital evidence in cybersecurity incidents forces us to approach the problem in a fully automated way. The need for a human factor in responding to incidents and traditional methods of evidence acquisition, such as cloning disks, is no longer serving efficiently in the race with time it takes to complete any cyber-attack; the attacks are successful before you even notice.</p>
<p>This calls for an automated way of collecting digital evidence from a suspected device and we should do it before it's too late. We need to integrate this telemetry with SIEM to trigger a collection of evidence on endpoints, just like a security camera starts recording with the help of motion sensor. This provides us with detailed information about what took place and with more accurate evidence, which is collected at the right time: the time when the incident took place and not later. Capturing the state of a compromised machine right after it provides shell access to cyber criminals—providing initial analysis of the collected evidence and making everything ready for a deep dive investigation—will help us turn the tables on the bad guys. Actually, this is only the beginning, we should also develop systems/platforms that will automatically analyze collected evidence and enrich this with threat intelligence to become faster and more accurate.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Getting started with security automation and orchestration</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Let's start with why we need <strong>Security Automation and Orchestration</strong> (<strong>SA&amp;O</strong>). With the rapid growth of single-point security solutions, most IT teams find themselves in troubled waters as this has lead to ineffective monitoring of security environments along with subpar incident response management. Grappling with a plethora of solutions that weren't designed to work in tandem not only wastes time and resources but also weighs heavy on an organization's budget. This is where SA&amp;O comes to the rescue as it saves an organization's precious time by enabling the point solutions to work together, thereby paving way for a centralized orchestration of incident-response actions. To be honest, there is a huge skill shortage in this area and as a result that section is in the book. Before we move ahead of what you need to learn, it's also good to understand what those terms mean.</p>
<p>Security orchestration is a method of connecting and integrating different security systems and processes. Orchestration serves as the connecting layer for your security operations. This saves time otherwise spent jumping from tool to tool in an effort to piece together information, enabling faster, more efficient, and accurate responses.</p>
<p>Security automation is the automatic handling of a task in an information or cybersecurity system. You can automate multiple tasks within a single product or system, but security orchestration is required in order to automate many tasks or security processes between other products, tools, or systems.</p>
<p>Security automation automatically handles the most tedious, and time-intensive tasks so that once you orchestrate your tools together, you can leverage streamlined playbooks or workflows to automate entire processes. This means that the moment a security issue arises, your workflows immediately kick into action, correlating data between tools, conducting deeper investigations, escalating alerts, and aiding in the response, as shown in the following diagram:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/3e383ff2-f273-47f0-81ab-6cd41dcaca58.png" style="width:42.17em;height:28.50em;"/></p>
<p>Automation and orchestration can enable security teams to prioritize and manage efficiency, and time-consuming response of alerts coming in from detection, and SIEM tools. It's important to learn how to use the automation orchestration, especially when it comes to investigating and remediating incidents. We saw CISO to a level 1 security analyst who believed that everything can be automated, which can be true but they also believed that it could be done at once! Without proper documentation there would be less benefit of automation and orchestration. Even for the most ambitious expert, automating every incident and every step in your incident-response workflow is as realistic as trying to boil the ocean. It's much more effective to walk before you run, especially when you become part of an enterprise security team, where typically multiple cross-functional teams are involved across a variety of different technologies.</p>
<p>For the last few years, security automation and orchestration has become a hot topic in the cybersecurity industry. So in this section, we will share some tips to help you take your first steps toward leveraging automation and orchestration.</p>
<p>Automation is not as easy as it sounds, you need to know when it can be used, and how to follow a workflow, to be successful.</p>
<p>Once you identify the security use case of security automation and orchestration, you can deliver a measurable impact. Here are three tips to help you identify great use cases for security automation and orchestration.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Step 1 – start small</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Having a smaller task or playbook will help you learn SA&amp;O. Having a small playbook/demo lab with a limited set of automation tasks can often provide a great learning path. One example is checking an IP across multiple reputation services and computing a weighted reputation score. Another might be to create or update a ticketing system. The key concept here is to automate key parts of a larger workflow so that you're able to work more efficiently and avoid context switching, as well as the need to copy and paste across multiple interfaces.</p>
<p>To help you get started, you can ask yourself the following questions, where your answers will form a map that essentially says <em>"Start here"</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are your top business drivers and priorities?</li>
<li>What's driving your strategies right now? The need for risk management, overall growth, stronger ROI, adherence to regulatory concerns such as GDPR?</li>
<li>What are the metrics that matter? Could it be an increase in the number of incidents investigated, for instance? Improved response time and MTTR? Cost management?</li>
</ul>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Step 2 – learn to analyze (incidents)</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Once you get familiar with SA&amp;O, you can move to the next step. Examining the operations plans for workflows will help you master more complex scenarios.</p>
<p>Here is an example. As phishing attacks are still the number-one entry point for many cyberattacks, learning to examine a suspected phishing email can be useful. Instead of repeating the same steps again and again, you can automate the repetitive actions, such as enriching an event with reputation data from a threat intelligence service, and then insert your staff into the workflow so they can make a close or escalation decision.</p>
<p>Over time, the more you start smaller and go step by step to more complex automation, you will be learning to fully automate the process. The benefit of this approach is that it allows you to devote your analysts, who are always in high demand, to more complex issues.</p>
<p>As a beginner, it's always good to learn the common incidents. Try to master the top-five incidents, get familiar with the vendors, and analyze them. Find out whether they require information to be gathered and actions to be taken on threat-intelligence feeds, firewalls, email server, and network devices' centralized credential stores. The more complex use cases will touch more systems as well as more teams, which brings us to the next step.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Step 3 – learn to monitor wisely</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The more you invest time in learning to analyze, the faster you can get to this final step, where you will need to find out how those analyzed steps can be automated. Then it's also important to define a set of metrics that can be used to measure the steps, which run back text help to build a report within the SOC. One common metric is <strong>Mean Time to Resolution</strong> (<strong>MTTR</strong>),which is a service-level metric for desktop support that measures the average elapsed time from when an incident is reported until the incident is resolved. This metric should decrease as a result of the efficiencies gained through security automation and orchestration.</p>
<p>Of course, the continuous improvement will add value to your skillset. If automation means investigating incidents in minutes instead of hours or days, you can quickly calculate those costs and even assess the benefits of the extra time of the analysts to focus on other, more critical work which may need automation or cannot be automated. Soon, you'll be able to leverage your new best practices and processes across the organization for the ultimate orchestration and automation benefits.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Three common security orchestration, automation, and response use cases</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Mastering use cases will help you gain lots of experience, so here are the top-three cases for you to focus on.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Phishing emails</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Phishing emails have become one of the most critical issues faced by organizations over the past several years. Some of the most recent high-profile data breaches have resulted from carefully crafted phishing emails. Security orchestration, automation, and response is perfectly positioned to enable the automatic triage and examination of suspected phishing emails by extracting artifacts from the email, then performing additional enrichment on these artifacts and, if necessary, containing the malicious email and any malicious payloads.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Malicious network traffic</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Alerts regarding malicious traffic could be received directly, or forwarded by a SIEM. Regardless, if you lean how to automate and orchestrate actions surrounding these types of events, you can save lots of time.</p>
<p>Once a log has been received, analysts use the data-enrichment tools, such as threat intelligence, reputation services, and IT asset inventories, and tools such as <kbd>nslookup</kbd> and <kbd>whois</kbd>. Analysts then determine whether the indicators appear to be malicious, at which point containment and further investigation would begin. If you use automation and orchestration, this process will be done automatically. Using the same automatization, searching for additional instances of the same indicator across the organization, and then alerting analysts to any additionally detected occurrences would be easier. Automated or semi-automated containment is also possible; for example, blocking an IP address or URL via the firewall or proxy, or isolating a host pending further investigation, depicted as follows:</p>

<p>Next, we will look at vulnerability management and how it can enhance monitoring efforts.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Vulnerability management</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Security orchestration automation is not intended to be a vulnerability-management platform and will never replace today's robust vulnerability-management systems, however there are some aspects that can help us. They can be used to ensure that the security team is made aware of any new vulnerabilities. Automation can be used to query a database of vulnerabilities to gather additional information on the vulnerability, query Active Directory or CMDB for asset information, or query a SIEM or EDR for events. Based on vulnerability, host, or event information, the case could be automatically upgraded or reassigned, or the host could even be temporarily isolated until appropriate mitigation tasks could be performed.</p>

<p>This chapter was all about why you need to learn operational security. We covered what proactive, reactive, and operational security mean, the significance of those pillars, as well as what a Security Operations Center is and why you need to understand it.</p>
<p>While this chapter focused on the operational and technical aspects of cybersecurity, the next chapter will throw some light on the importance of human elements, such as if you want to choose any career, how to pick a mentor in your field. We will look at the importance of interpersonal networking, because security is never achieved alone, and you will need information and contacts to get important information, guidance, or even land a job.</p>
