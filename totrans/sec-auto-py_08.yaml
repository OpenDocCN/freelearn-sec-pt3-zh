- en: In modern cybersecurity, ML and AI are revolutionizing the ability to detect
    and respond to threats with unprecedented speed and precision. One of the most
    impactful uses of these technologies is automated threat detection. By analyzing
    historical threat data, ML algorithms can identify patterns in network traffic
    that may signal a potential attack. For example, a **supervised learning** ( **SL**
    ) algorithm can be trained on labeled data containing both benign and malicious
    network behaviors. Once trained, this model can automatically flag suspicious
    activities, such as unexpected data exfiltration, without human intervention.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Additionally, AI-based anomaly detection systems can be deployed to monitor
    user behavior, detecting deviations from normal patterns that might indicate a
    compromised account or insider threat. These systems use **unsupervised learning**
    ( **UL** ) to build baselines of normal behavior, dynamically adjusting to each
    user or endpoint in the network. When a significant deviation occurs—such as access
    to sensitive data outside normal business hours—the system can trigger alerts,
    launch automated investigations, or even execute predefined remediation actions
    such as quarantining an endpoint or revoking access.
