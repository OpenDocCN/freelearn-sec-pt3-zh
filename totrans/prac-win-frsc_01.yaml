    work, how we store or retrieve data, and even the rate of life is changing. Technology
    is changing everything. Crime has its share of the change because the nature of
    targeted valuable assets has changed, it is digital now. The normal users can
    now perform monetary transactions without leaving their chair, and corporations
    and businesses of different sizes and types usually exchange their sensitive data
    using their local network. So in return, instead of breaking into banks or companies,
    crime has also gone digital. Nowadays, your personal information, bank account
    details, and your corporate database are some of the targets for digital criminals.

    and in another case an attacker somehow hacked into the bank's private network
    and transferred money to his account. Both of these are targeting the monetary
    assets of the company.

    apply their investigation skills to the crime scene. They would track the attacker's
    fingerprints and activities to finally get a clear idea about what happened and
    identify the criminal. In the second scenario, the investigator needs to track
    the criminal's digital traces on the local system, the network, and even through
    the Internet in order to understand the criminal's activities, and this may uncover
    their digital identity.

    and target. In cybercrime, the investigator needs to know the malicious code—the
    weapon—that the attacker used in conducting their crime, the vulnerability exploited
    to compromise the digital system, and the size of the damage. In the same way,
    we can apply the same investigation mechanisms to digital crime after taking into
    consideration the different nature of assets and attacks.

    credit cards and money online, to espionage between countries or big companies;
    as we recently saw there were some famous and aggressive malware programs and
    attacks that were thought to be developed with nation-level support against other
    nations, targeting some infrastructure or sensitive information. Also, these attacks
    that were targeted at some famous companies in different fields led to information
    and data leakage.

    gained great importance in the last decade in both governmental and private sectors.

- en: Identifying and analyzing information security incidents and the related digital
    evidence is called **digital forensics**. Generally, forensic science is the scientific
    method of gathering and examining data about the past to extract useful information
    related to the case under investigation. Digital forensics is the analysis of
    digital evidence in order to answer questions related to a digital incident, which
    takes place at the time of the analysis in case of a live analysis or takes place
    in the past; this is called **postmortem analysis**.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Postmortem analysis is applied after the incident has occurred, and it usually
    takes place in all cases. However, some cases require the analysis to be conducted
    during the incident. Generally, the analysis can confirm or refute a hypothesis
    about the incident to rebuild a full picture about the activities of both the
    attacker and the victim during the time of the incident.

    of the incident and collect the data that is important to the investigation. They
    need to understand the usual behavior of the systems and the structure of the
    network, and they need to interview responsible individuals if needed. These are
    important to totally understand the environment and handle the possible evidence
    properly so that they do not lose valuable information or miss collecting related
    evidence.'

    Each acquisition or analysis step performed on a live system will leave a trace,
    and in some cases, this overwrites previous data or traces either in the system
    memory or on the hard drive. The responder must understand the consequences of
    using the handling tools on the system and try to minimize their tools' traces
    on the system in order to minimize data loss during incident handling.

    to build a whole picture of the incident. In a busy working environment, retrieving
    the status of the incident scene won't be easy. One way to memorize this is to
    take notes about all the systems in the scene, and in some cases, taking snapshots
    will be beneficial to remembering how these devices were connected.

    to the security incident under investigation. The digital device was either used
    to commit a crime, to target an attack, or is a source of information for the
    analyst. The goals of the analysis phase in the digital forensics process differ
    from one case to another. It can be used to support or refute assumptions against
    individuals or entities, or it can be used to investigate information security
    incidents locally on the system or over a network.

    in hand. Shutting the system down is one of the "don''ts" that the responder shouldn''t
    do. Performing some primary analysis of the live system can provide valuable information
    that can guide the analyst in the future investigation. Also, in some situations,
    a quick analysis of the incident is highly required when there is no time to go
    through the normal steps of the analysis.'

    responder acquires all the available data from the incident scene, and then conducts
    postmortem analysis on the evidence.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Mainly, the hybrid approach is considered the best, where the responder conducts
    the live analysis on the powered on and accessible systems, records their findings,
    and acquires all the data, including the live ones, for postmortem analysis. Combining
    both results from live and postmortem analysis can clearly explain the status
    of the system under investigation. Performing the acquisition first in such a
    case is the best practice as the evidence will be acquired before any analysis
    traces are in the system.
