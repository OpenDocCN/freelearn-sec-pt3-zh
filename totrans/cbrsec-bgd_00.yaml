- en: On the other hand, independent research firms, such as Gartner; Fortune companies,
    such as Microsoft and Cisco; respected magazines, such as Forbes; global non-profit
    organizations, such as ISACA; governments; and recruiters are talking about the
    cybersecurity skill shortage today, and they estimate that the talent gap is in
    the millions. There are many organizations and individuals that are passionate
    about closing this gap. There are also possibly endless resources, although very
    fragmented, on the internet. You will find many books and videos that have the
    essentials to get you started in cybersecurity, but none of them provide guidance
    from A to Z on what beginners need to know, what core technology they need to
    focus on, why they need to have a mentor, how they can network, which certifications
    they can take, how they can find the resources they need, and finally, how they
    can find a job.
