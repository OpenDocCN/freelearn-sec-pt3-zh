    you protect an organization if you don't know what assets they have?"*. We both
    know the answer to that question is *"You can't,"* and we've probably been asked
    this question a thousand times between the two of us, so I'm not going to ask
    it. Instead, I'm going to show you how you might structure the appropriate processes
    at your organization in order to discover and protect its assets.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These various processes combine to create what is known as an **Information
    Security Management System** (**ISMS**). We covered various key concepts in [*Chapter
    1*](B16611_01_Final_JM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor013), *InfoSec and Risk Management*,
    but overall, there was much less structure than most organizations would require.
    What we want to be able to achieve with the ISMS is to appropriately identify
    and classify our organization's assets, and ensure the security of those assets
    is adequately protected by implementing the appropriate controls, taking into
    consideration *defense in depth* for each vertical of confidentiality, integrity,
    and availability.

    to implement an effective ISMS. One that ensures, through policies and procedures

    There exists an extremely important question of *"Who is responsible for what?"*,
    which should be asked and documented. I'd like to briefly touch on the role of
    **top management**, and how we might translate our findings into effective communications
    about risk to the appropriate audience. Improving on this should allow you to
    act with authority in your mitigation strategies moving forward.

    of buy-in is attained, we can move onto the actual development of the policies,
    which will act as the information security "rules" for your organization. This
    is absolutely crucial in being able to systematically define "baselines" for security,
    organize assets, reduce risk, and communicate the information security requirements
    to members of your organization.

    information security, it's ultimately **senior management** who is responsible.
    What does this actually mean, in practice? Well, they hire you. Hiring an information
    security professional to delegate the responsibilities to is the most logical
    thing to do as a CEO who has been hearing of their growing responsibilities in
    information security.

    communicate the organization's strategic objectives. With those objectives in
    mind, you are able to align all information security requirements to those goals.

    to understand the risks associated with your specific organization and communicate
    this to your CEO, or CIO, or CTO, or some other **C-level** in a digestible way.
    This is a pretty normal situation, but having said that, I've met folks who were
    responsible for security at their organizations who seemingly never report their
    findings to the C-level, and then complain that the company doesn't take security
    seriously. Yeah, of course not! How could they?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is now your responsibility to assess the level of risk that faces the organization
    and turn it into a legitimate business case for senior management at your organization,
    in a way that is easy for them to understand. Keep in mind, these people are top
    management! Their childhood didn't consist of browsing the web; it consisted of
    playing stickball near Old Man River's house and drinking seltzer at the local
    pharmacy. As for their day-to-day use of "computers," they've probably been limited
    to email and (recently) a mobile device, and it all seems pretty magical to them.

    It ensures a systematic approach to accurately discover, measure, contain, and
    mitigate the information security risk at your organization in order to ensure
    your organization is adequately protected from malicious actors, accidental loss,
    and regulatory impact, with risk at the heart of the decision-making process.

    operational requirements, regulations, retention periods, the ability of the staff,

    procedures, baselines, and guidance in relation to information security at your
    organization. This is an extremely important step in order to achieve your goal
    of a risk-focused, mature *information security program*. As a result, it is the

    in a way that streamlines compliance with specific regulations. There are many
    information security frameworks and standards that are available, and structuring
    your policies to suit one or more of those will present a logical sequence of
    requirements. One way, for example, is to follow the requirements of the **ISO/IEC
    27001** (ISO 27001) international standard for your ISMS. In this chapter, I'm
    going to leverage the ISO 27001 standard's requirements to help us create documents

    a tabletop exercise is that they're inexpensive and easy to facilitate, while
    still measuring the impact of various events. In order to make tabletop exercises
