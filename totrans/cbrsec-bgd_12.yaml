    honors degree in university was, you will start your new job most probably from
    the bottom and you need to work your way up. There is no shortcut. The first step
    toward choosing any career must be identifying your core strength. If you are
    not a developer and you don't like coding, for example, don't force yourself to
    become one. This chapter will give you a holistic overview of how to secure a
    cybersecurity job from scratch. You will be equipped with knowledge of how you
    should proceed with your job search.
