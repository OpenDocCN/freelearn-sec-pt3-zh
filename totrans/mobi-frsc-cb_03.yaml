    15% of the mobile device market. Due to this fact, they often become the object
    of forensic analysis.

- en: Mobile devices from the Apple company are the most complex objects in forensic
    analysis. The restrictions of access to the user’s data used in the devices do
    not allow extracting the data in full. The encryption makes the use of all known
    file recovery algorithms useless. Even if you manage to recover a file in some
    way, its content will be unavailable, as it will remain encrypted.
  prefs: []

- en: The complete examination of an Apple device is possible if you jailbreak it.
    The file system can be extracted from such a device and via analysis of the file
    system, you can extract a maximum number of user data. However, this operation
    cannot be performed for all types of such devices.

- en: For mobile devices up to and including the iPhone 4, you can make physical dumps.
    It allows you not only to fully extract user’s data from devices, but also to
    recover the screen lock password. You can make physical dumps of Apple mobile
    devices using forensic programs like UFED Physical Analyzer (Cellebrite), Elcomsoft
    iOS Forensic Toolkit (Elcomsoft), or XRY (Micro Systemation).

    a user’s data from a locked device. Apart from the above mentioned method of screen
    lock password recovery from old Apple devices, there are methods of passwords
    recovery for the new devices. This function is implemented in software products
    such as: UFED Physical Analyzer (Cellebrite), Advanced Physical Extractor (Susteen),
    and also in a hardware solution called IP-BOX. The use of these methods is also
    limited due to the emergence of additional features in new versions of the iOS
    operating system that provide even more security.'

    of expensive forensic programs or forensic hardware solutions is the use of lockdown

- en: Alternative sources of information stored on Apple's mobile devices are backups,
    which can be found on the computers and laptops of device owners and in their
    iCloud accounts. Often, mobile device owners do not realize that when a mobile
    device is connected to a computer, the device's backup is automatically created.
    Due to this fact, the owners of the devices do not take measures to delete such
    backups.

    backup. The only thing that will be available is the function of copying media
