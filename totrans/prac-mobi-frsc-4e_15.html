<p>Despite the fact that Windows Phones are not so widely used nowadays, they may still be encountered during forensic investigations. These devices are the most affordable on the market, so understanding how to acquire, analyze, and decode data from Windows Phones is important. Locating and interpreting digital evidence present on these devices requires specialized knowledge of the Windows Phone operating system, and may not always be possible. Commercial forensic and open source tools provide limited support for acquiring user data from Windows devices. As Windows Phones do not occupy much of the mobile market space, most forensic practitioners are unfamiliar with the data formats, embedded databases that are used, and other artifacts that exist on the device. This chapter provides an overview of Windows Phone forensics, describing various methods of acquiring and examining data on Windows mobile devices.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows Phone OS</li>
<li>Windows 10 Mobile security model</li>
<li>Windows Phone filesystem</li>
<li>Data acquisition</li>
<li>Commercial forensic tool acquisition methods</li>
<li>Extracting data without the use of commercial tools</li>
<li>Key artifacts for examination</li>
</ul>

<p>Windows Phone is a proprietary mobile operating system developed by Microsoft. It was launched as a successor to Windows Mobile, but it does not provide backward compatibility with the previous platform. Windows Phone was launched in October 2010 with Windows Phone 7. The version history of the Windows Phone operating system then continued with the release of Windows Phone 7.5, Windows Phone 7.8, Windows Phone 8.1, and Windows Phone 10. </p>
<p>Despite the fact that Microsoft claims they have stopped developing this mobile operating system, excluding security patches, you are likely to face it as a mobile forensic examiner.</p>
<p>The following sections will provide more details about Windows Phone, its features, and its underlying security model.</p>
<p>Unlike Android and iOS devices, Windows Phone comes with a new interface, which uses so-called <em>tiles</em> for apps instead of icons, as shown in the following image. These tiles can be designed and updated by the user:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1131 image-border" src="assets/30307387-c6e6-494b-bc37-7c137ded4400.png" style="width:18.50em;height:32.08em;"/></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">The Windows Phone home screen</div>
<p>Similar to other mobile platforms, Windows Phone allows for the installation of third-party apps. These apps can be downloaded from the Windows Phone Marketplace, which is managed by Microsoft. When comparing the number of apps available for iOS and Android devices, Windows Phone pales in comparison. However, applications are available and you should expect to see them on Windows Phone devices.</p>
<p>Windows Phone introduced new features, making it more similar to other smartphones compared to Windows Mobile:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cortana</strong><span>: This is the personal assistant for the device. It was introduced in Windows 8.1 and is still present on Windows 10 devices. Cortana aids the user by fielding questions using Bing, setting reminders, sending texts, and essentially using all the functionality to provide the user with a better and easier experience. Everything that Cortana does leaves a trace on the device.</span></li>
<li><strong>Wallet</strong>: This stores credit card accounts, boarding passes, tickets, coupons, and more.</li>
<li><strong>Geofence and advanced location settings</strong>: These provide the user with additional protection as the phone can detect when it is out of a trusted zone and may lock itself.</li>
<li><strong>Additional features</strong>: These are features such as live tiles, enhanced colors, and quiet hours.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other common applications associated with Windows Phone include OneDrive (formerly SkyDrive), OneNote, and Office 365 synchronization. OneDrive provides the user with access to all of their documents and files from any device. OneNote is essentially the same, but it acts as a notebook or diary. Office 365 provides the user with constant access to their email, calendar, contacts, and more across multiple devices.</p>
<p>The introduction of data synchronization across multiple devices makes our job as forensic examiners difficult. It is our job to determine how the evidence was placed on the device. Is it possible to definitively state how an artifact was placed on a device? To be honest, this depends. Nobody wants to hear this response, but a lot of factors must be considered. What is the app? What OS is running on the device? What is the artifact? For example, let's consider OneDrive. If the device contains documents from OneDrive, the original author should be contained within the metadata. This, together with examining whether or not the content was shared with the device, may provide a glimpse into how the artifact was created. However, when examining a calendar entry when Office 365 is in place, it may be impossible to state whether the user created the entry on their phone, PC, or laptop. The synchronization is instantaneous, and status flags stating where the artifact was created do not always exist. If this artifact is indeed the <em>smoking gun</em> of the investigation, you need to apply your skills to uncover other artifacts that support your findings. Digging deeper into the data is required. Now that we are aware of the details of Windows Phone and its features, let's have a look at its security model and see how it keeps the data secure.</p>

<p>The security model of Windows Phone is designed to make sure that the user data present on the device is safe and secure. The following sections provide a brief explanation of the concepts that Windows Phone security is built on.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>Windows Phone is heavily built on the principles of least privilege and isolation. This has been consistent since the inception of Windows Phone 7. To achieve this, Windows Phone introduced the concept of <strong>chambers</strong>. Each chamber has an isolation boundary where processes can run. Depending on the security policy of a specific chamber, a process running in this chamber has the privilege of accessing the OS's resources and capabilities (<a href="https://www.msec.be/mobcom/ws2013/presentations/david_hernie.pdf">https://www.msec.be/mobcom/ws2013/presentations/david_hernie.pdf</a>). There are four types of security chambers. The following is a brief description of each of them:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Trusted Computing Base</strong> (<strong>TCB</strong>): The processes here have unrestricted access to most Windows Phone resources. This chamber has privileges to modify policies and enforce the security model. The kernel runs in this chamber.</li>
<li><strong>Elevated Rights Chamber</strong> (<strong>ERC</strong>): This chamber is less privileged than the TCB chamber. It has privileges to access all resources except the security policy. This chamber is mainly used for services and user-mode drivers, which provide functionality intended for use by other applications on the phone.</li>
<li><strong>Standard Rights Chamber</strong> (<strong>SRC</strong>): This is the default chamber for preinstalled applications, such as Microsoft Outlook Mobile 2010.</li>
<li><strong>Least Privileged Chamber</strong> (<strong>LPC</strong>): This is the default chamber for all the applications that are downloaded and installed through the Marketplace Hub (which is also known as the Windows Phone Marketplace).</li>
</ul>
<p>Next, we will be looking at encryption.</p>

<p>Windows Phone 8 introduced BitLocker technology to encrypt all user data that is stored on the device via AES 128-bit encryption. The user can simply flip the switch to enable this feature, and all of their data residing on the internal storage of the device will be encrypted. In addition, the user can encrypt their SD card <span>–</span> assuming the device has one <span>–</span> and set a password or PIN on their device. Should all of these locks and the encryption be enabled, accessing the data on this device may be impossible, unless the password is recovered.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Capabilities are defined as the resources on the phone (camera, location information, microphone, and more) associated with security, privacy, and cost. The LPC has a minimal set of access rights by default. However, this can be expanded by requesting more capabilities during the installation. Capabilities are granted during the app's installation and cannot be modified or elevated during runtime. For this reason, it is difficult to side-load applications or force custom boot code to the device to gain forensic access, as it is normally rejected prior to bootup.</p>
<p>To install an app on a Windows Phone, you need to sign in to the Marketplace with a Windows Live ID. During installation, apps are required to ask the user for permission before using certain capabilities, an example of which is shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/6388ff6d-7573-4960-9835-8206c6a585b0.png" style="width:20.00em;height:26.58em;"/></div>
<div class="packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">Windows app requesting user permissions (https://i-msdn.sec.s-msft.com/dynimg/IC752370.png)</div>
<p>This is similar to the permission model in Android. This gives the user the freedom to learn about all the capabilities that an application has before installing the application. The list of all capabilities is included in the <kbd>WMAppManifest.xml</kbd> application manifest file, which can be accessed through Visual Studio or other methods that are defined at <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/apps/ff769509(v=vs.105)">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/apps/ff769509(v=vs.105)</a>.</p>

<p>Apps in Windows Phone run in a sandboxed environment. This means every application on Windows Phone runs in its own chamber. Applications are isolated from each other and cannot access the data of other applications. If any app needs to save information to the device, it can do so using the isolated storage, which is restricted from access by other applications. Also, the third-party applications installed on Windows Phone cannot run in the background; that is, when the user switches to a different application, the previously used application is shut down (although the application state is preserved). This ensures that the application cannot perform activities such as communicating over the internet when the user is not using the application. These restrictions also make Windows Phone less susceptible to malware, but you should never assume that any device is safe. It is just more challenging for malware to function on these devices.</p>
<p>So far, we have had a look at the four types of security chambers and we now know that Windows Phone 8 uses BitLocker technology for encryption. We have learned about the different capabilities granted during the installation of an application and saw how every application is isolated from each other. Next, we'll look at an important aspect of Windows Phones, which is its filesystem.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Windows Phone filesystem</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>The Windows Phone filesystem is more or less similar to the filesystems used in Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows 10. From the root directory, you can reach different files and folders that are available on this device. From a forensic perspective, the following are some of the folders that can yield valuable data. All the listed directories are located in the root directory:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Application data</strong>: This directory contains data of applications on the phone, such as Outlook, Maps, and Internet Explorer.</li>
<li><strong>Applications</strong>: This directory contains the apps installed by the user. The isolated storage, which is allocated or used by each app, is also located in this folder.</li>
<li><strong>My Documents</strong>: This directory holds different Office documents, such as Word, Excel, or PowerPoint files. The directory also includes configuration files and multimedia files, such as music or videos.</li>
<li><strong>Windows</strong>: This directory contains files that are related to the Windows Phone operating system.</li>
</ul>
<p>The acquisition method used here will determine the amount of filesystem access that you have to the device. For example, a physical image may provide access to several partitions that can be recovered from the data dump. A Windows Phone 10 device that contains 27 partitions can be seen in the following screenshot. Partitions <span class="packt_screen">26</span> (<span class="packt_screen">MainOS</span>) and <span class="packt_screen">27</span> (<span class="packt_screen">Data</span>) contain the relevant data:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/a01679b0-da6d-490a-bd0e-28a6a3ac4dda.png" style="width:14.58em;height:29.25em;"/></div>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Windows Phone 10 partitions</div>
<div class="packt_tip"><span>While most artifacts will exist in the <span class="packt_screen">Data</span> partition, it is always best practice to capture and analyze both when possible.</span></div>
<p>The <span class="packt_screen">MainOS</span> partition in the preceding screenshot, partition <span class="packt_screen">26</span>, contains the system data from the Windows Phone. As in all Windows investigations, the system data contains artifacts relevant to investigations.</p>
<p>In this example, partition 27 contains the <span class="packt_screen">User</span> or <span class="packt_screen">Data</span> partition. Depending on the device, the partition numbers may vary. In our example, the <span class="packt_screen">Data</span> partition is shown in the following screenshot as partition <span class="packt_screen">27</span>. Here, the SMS, email, application data, contacts, call logs, and internet history were recovered using mobile forensic tools. These methods will be discussed later in this chapter:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1132 image-border" src="assets/8ab48656-e301-4baf-90a0-571f40175c3c.png" style="width:13.92em;height:22.42em;"/></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref"><span>Windows Phone 10 Data partition</span></div>
<p>Windows Phone also maintains the <strong>Windows registry</strong>, a database that stores environment variables on the operating system. The Windows registry is basically a directory that stores settings and options for the Microsoft operating system. Windows Phone is no different. When examining a Windows Phone, you will expect to see the <kbd>NTUSER.dat</kbd>, <kbd>SAM</kbd>, <kbd>SYSTEM</kbd>, <kbd>SOFTWARE</kbd>, <kbd>SECURITY</kbd>, and <kbd>DEFAULT</kbd> hives. While these hives may be unique to the phone, they can be examined just like traditional Windows registry hives.</p>
<p>A detailed case investigation is included in a paper by Cynthia Murphy. This involves a criminal case of a home invasion and sexual assault and details the efforts of great minds in the forensic community to uncover artifacts that assisted in closing the investigation. Sometimes, the mobile device is the most important artifact pertaining to the case. For more information, please refer to <a href="https://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/forensics/windows-phone-8-forensic-artifacts-35787">https://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/forensics/windows-phone-8-forensic-artifacts-35787</a>. Now that we have looked at the file and folder structure, let's learn how to acquire data using this knowledge.</p>

<p>Acquiring data from a Windows Phone is challenging for forensic examiners, as the physical, filesystem, and logical methods that were defined in previous chapters are not greatly supported. In addition to this, the phone may need to be at a specific battery charge state (%) in order for the commercial tool to recognize and acquire the device. This is often one of the most difficult steps in acquiring Windows Phones. </p>
<p>One of the most common techniques that's implemented by commercial tools attempting data acquisition is to install an application or agent on the device, which enables two-way communication for commands to be sent to the device in order to extract data. This could result in certain changes on the device; nevertheless, this is still forensically sound if the examiner follows standard protocols and has tested the validity of the tool being used. These protocols include proper testing to ensure no user data is changed (and if changed, documenting what occurred), validation of the method on a test device, and documenting all steps taken during the acquisition process. For this acquisition method to work, the app needs to be installed with the privileges of the SRC. This may require you to copy the manufacturer's DLLs, which have higher privileges, into the user app. This allows the app to access methods and resources that are usually limited to native apps. In addition to this, the device must be unlocked, or these methods may not work.</p>
<p>Most examiners rely on forensic tools and methods to acquire mobile devices. Again, these practices are not as supported for Windows Phones. Keep in mind that to deploy and run an app on Windows Phone, both the device and the developer must be registered and unlocked by Microsoft. This restriction can be bypassed by unlocking the device using a public jailbreak for Windows Phone 8 to 10 devices. </p>
<p>For quite a long time, J<span>TAG and chip-off acquisitions were the only options to acquire most Windows Phones. Everything changed in January 2015: Cellebrite implemented an acquisition module that allowed mobile forensic examiners to extract data at the physical level from most Lumia devices.</span></p>
<p>Later, the Windows Phone Internals project presented a way to unlock the<span> bootloader of some Lumia devices, including 520, 521, 525, 620, 625, 720, 820, 920, 925, 928, 1020, and 1320. This made the physical acquisition of these devices possible. You can learn more about this project at <a href="https://www.wpinternals.net/">https://www.wpinternals.net/</a>. Now, we will look at some of the commercial tools that are used for acquisition methods.</span></p>

<p>There are a few commercial tools available that offer support for the acquisition of Windows Phone devices. Cellebrite UFED offers support to acquire Windows Phone devices using the physical, <span>f</span><span>ilesystem, and </span><span>l</span><span>ogical</span><span> </span>methods. To determine whether the device you are examining is supported by the tool, you can download and use the UFED Phone Detective mobile app, which is available for free both in App Store and Google Play:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/0c518b6b-1d90-4e67-9b2e-423447d8881a.png" style="width:15.08em;height:24.25em;"/></p>
<div class="mce-root CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Searching for supported Lumia devices</div>
<p>Some of these acquisition methods are more robust, obtain a full physical dump of the data, and can bypass some lock codes on specific devices. However, some device support includes simply extracting contacts and pictures from the device. It is important for the examiner to realize that specific steps must be taken, as directed by the tool. Acquiring these devices is not easy, and often, you will find that the tool will not be successful.</p>
<p>When the tool seems to fail, attempt to acquire the device using the Smartphone/PDA option offered in UFED. To do this, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Launch UFED4PC and select <span class="packt_screen">Mobile Device</span>.</li>
<li>Select <span class="packt_screen">Browse Manually</span>.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li>Select <span class="packt_screen">Smartphones</span>.</li>
<li>Select the Windows device that you are attempting to acquire.</li>
<li>Try all the methods that are offered, starting with <span>physical,</span><span> </span><span>f</span><span>ilesystem, and </span><span>l</span><span>ogical</span> (in that order, where possible):</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/c8f9e1fd-4654-4dc2-a8a7-06834b499f67.png" style="width:24.42em;height:11.25em;"/></p>
<div class="mce-root packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">Extraction methods</div>
<ol start="6">
<li>Follow all the remaining steps and try all offered acquisition methods until you're successful.</li>
</ol>
<p>Cellebrite may alert you that the acquisition is not successful for several reasons. When this occurs, try every option to ensure you have exhausted the commercial options available. An example of an acquisition attempt in UFED4PC is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Launch UFED4PC.</li>
<li>Select your Make and Model for the device.</li>
<li>Select the <span class="packt_screen">Physical</span>, <span class="packt_screen">File System</span>, or <span class="packt_screen">Logical</span> acquisition method (offerings will vary, depending on the device model).</li>
</ol>
<p>In this example, only <span class="packt_screen">Logical</span> acquisition was supported. Two methods are available. The first option uses a cable, while the second uses Bluetooth. In this example, a special UFED cable is required. I selected the UFED cable first, as Bluetooth requires that additional changes are made to the phone during pairing:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/058b870d-c35c-4c72-b1c8-d1fe7c5ffad6.png" style="width:14.08em;height:5.00em;"/></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">UFED4PC Logical extraction options</div>
<p>When attempting to acquire the device with USB cable 100, only multimedia files were accessible.</p>
<p>Then, attempt the same acquisition, but select <span class="packt_screen">Bluetooth</span>. Follow the instructions given to pair the device with the forensic workstation:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1133 image-border" src="assets/86aa9cb4-5540-4ae2-b569-bbde218e48e4.png" style="width:61.25em;height:27.92em;"/></p>
<div class="packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">UFED4PC extraction options (Bluetooth)</div>
<div>
<p>With this acquisition method, we were able to obtain contacts. Note that there are no methods offered to obtain <span class="packt_screen">SMS</span>, <span class="packt_screen">MMS</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Email</span>, <span class="packt_screen">IM</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Calendar</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Call Logs</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Apps Data</span>, and others. It is suggested you repeat the generic methods listed in the previous screenshot using the <span class="packt_screen">Smartphone</span> option in UFED4PC. So far, we have looked at some acquisition methods using commercial tools. Now, let's learn how to extract data without these tools.</p>

<p>In some cases, the physical acquisition of Windows Phone devices is possible only with advance methods, such as JTAG and chip-off. But thanks to the security researcher known as Heathcliff, it became possible to perform physical acquisition on limited phone models and operating system versions with his tool called <strong>WPinternals</strong> (<a href="https://www.wpinternals.net">https://www.wpinternals.net</a>).</p>
<p>The tool supports the following models of Lumia phones: <span>520, 521, 525, 620, 625, 720, 820, 920, 925, 928, 1020, and 1320.</span></p>

            <article>
                
<p>Windows Phones may contain removable SD cards. These cards may be secured with a key that prevents the SD card from being removed and used, or accessed via other devices (phones, cameras, computers, and more). This is different from the key that is created if the user encrypts the SD card. Brute-force and dictionary attacks can be run on user-encrypted SD cards in an attempt to access the data. When examining a Windows Phone, it is best to research the device to see whether SD card security will be a factor when acquiring data from the device. If so, simply follow the preceding steps and acquire the SD card data through the phone during forensic extraction. Please refer to the following chart.</p>
<p>For devices where the SD card can be removed, you have two scenarios to consider. If the device is on, should you acquire the phone and the SD card as is? If the device is off, should you remove the SD card and acquire the device using FTK Imager? The answer is, it depends. In forensics, we use this statement frequently, but it remains true. If you leave the device on, it must be isolated from the network to ensure that it is not remotely accessed and immediately acquired, or the battery will drain and, ultimately, the device may power down. If the device is off and you remove the SD card, you must ensure that the card remains tied to the device itself and is acquired both externally and internally to ensure all data is captured. In a normal situation, the following chart suggests the recommended steps to handle SD cards that are found in Windows Phones:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/a683ede6-7db3-46bc-8ebe-be72342bf9a0.png" style="width:22.75em;height:26.25em;"/></div>
<p>Most commercial forensic tools will offer to extract data from SD cards. Often, the phone extraction process will only extract data residing on the SD card. This is often the case when there is no support for a specific Windows Phone. If the SD card is not recognized by the tool and the data is not extracted, it is likely that the SD card has been encrypted by the user, and the password for the device is different from the password for the SD card. When this occurs, try to crack the passcode and reacquire the device. Note that cracking a passcode on an SD card may not always be possible, but it's worth a shot trying brute-force and dictionary attacks as you would on a standard hard drive or external device.</p>
<p>When acquiring an SD that has been removed from a Windows Phone, FTK Imager is a free and reliable option to create a forensically sound image that can be examined in a variety of tools. To create an SD card image, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Remove the SD card from the device and make sure to document all identifiers on the card and the phone to ensure that they are not permanently separated.</li>
<li>Insert the SD card into a <em>write blocker</em> and insert this into your forensic workstation.</li>
<li>Launch FTK Imager.</li>

<p>Acquiring data from Windows Phone devices is challenging since they are secure, and commercial forensic tools and open source methods do not provide easy solutions for forensic examiners like you. Multiple tools, chip-off, JTAG, and the methods we defined in this book are some of the methods that provide access to user data on Windows Phone devices. Often, you will find that Windows Phone devices require multiple extraction methods to acquire accessible data. The biggest challenge is getting access to the device to acquire the data. Once the data is available, all the extracted information can be analyzed by you.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we covered the interface, important features, and the security model of the Windows Phone device. Then, we had a look at the different partitions and folder structure within the Windows filesystem. The Windows Phone registry is similar to the registry in the Microsoft operating system. We saw how to extract data with and without using commercial tools and looked at some common Windows Phone forensic artifacts. With this knowledge, you can now extract user data from a Windows Phone using multiple extraction methods.</p>
<p>The next chapter will walk you through parsing third-party application files.</p>
