    training. Theoretical approaches just give details on some aspects of cybersecurity,
    but they rarely impart skills to the learner. This is why hands-on experience
    is required, so that a learner can apply the principles they have learned to a
    real-world environment. Hands-on training allows for skills to be learned more
    efficiently and learners can appreciate the importance of all the tiny details.
    For instance, a flaw in the configuration of a firewall could lead to a network

    the physical presence of an instructor who interacts with students, with the goal
    of imparting to them new skills or developing the skills that the instructor already
    possesses. Technology has made ILT quite easy. It is suitable for training where
    there are complex topics that require expert, hands-on experience.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In ILT, the training is offered in training circles. Students get to work together
    in the same physical space and they can assist each other with challenges. The
    collaboration between students often plays a key role in the success of this method
    of training. Students can interact with each other by sharing challenges, experiences,
    tips, and tricks that can make the training easier or more fun. The end effect
    is that complex topics become more accessible due to the synergy between the students.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The cons of this type of training include limited accessibility, as students
    usually have to travel to get to the training venue. Additionally, they have to
    proceed at the same pace. This method is also expensive, and most of the expenses
    cannot be evaded. The reach of this type of training is also limited because the
    trainer and students have to meet physically. However, institutions are also offering
    boot camp sessions, which are shorter training events that can be rotated regularly
    in different locations. This improves the reach and accessibility of the training
    program.

    are virtual instructor-led classes on the internet. Both students and instructors
    do not have to travel to attend a class since they can participate from anywhere
    provided that they have a stable internet connection. The institutions offering
    this training have the advantage of not having to rent rooms for students to study
    in. There is more flexibility with this learning model since students can take
    up other tasks before and after the classes. The classes are also more time-efficient
    and will start and end at predefined times. The quality of training can also be
    high, since the institution is able to hire qualified personnel from anywhere,
    as long as they have a reliable internet connection.

- en: However, VILT comes with its own set of challenges. To begin with, it is virtual
    and, therefore, comes with self-discipline requirements for the learners. Students
    have to avoid distractions such as phones while the training is going on. It is
    tempting for students, without physical supervision, to wander away from the training
    and be distracted by other things in their environment. Some estimates show that
    the attention-span for a VILT is 25%. This means that many students do wander
    off during the training session. The scope for interacting with instructors is
    also limited. This type of training tends to have many students per session, reducing
    the chance for each student to voice their concerns or ask questions to the instructor.
    The instructor is also unable to connect with the students. This is because one
    of the ways instructors know whether students understand what is being taught
    is by looking at their body language. VILT does not offer the best medium for
    instructors to observe non-verbal communication from their students. Finally,
    there is a limitation to the practicality of this type of training. Students are
    sent resources through PDFs, video clips, or manuals. However, these resources
    are not always optimized for different screen sizes and it can be uncomfortable
    for some students to actually follow the training.

    to cost-effectiveness. In this type of training, the student does not have to
    go at the pace of other students or that of the trainer. Fast learners will complete
    it quickly, while slow learners will have the chance to stretch their learning
    timelines over a longer duration so that they can grasp what is being taught.
    This method of learning is also cost-effective. Institutions that offer self-study
    modules often price them cheaply or for free. For instance, you can learn many
    skills by watching and using YouTube tutorials, which are free of charge. A course
    that might cost thousands of dollars to take in college could be priced at under
    $1,000.

    them to identify the vulnerabilities on their websites, thus making them safer.
    A big advantage of this tool is that a user can also schedule automatic security
    scans after a certain duration. This helps in the monitoring of the website, as
    the user is notified if their website has any newly developed security issues.

    available are limited. Therefore, it is extremely difficult to find training courses
    that cater to the needs of new talent interested in the subject. However, there
    are few training providers that offer free-of-cost cybersecurity training for
    young enthusiastic minds. We go through these training providers in the following
    sections.

- en: In this chapter, we looked at an avenue for training through cybersecurity labs.
    It began with a cross-examination of the types of online learning methods and
    discussed ILT, VILT, and self-study. We then explored the benefits of self-study
    and why it is gaining wide acceptance in the cybersecurity industry. This method
    of learning is also helping to address the shortage of sufficiently trained skillsets
    in the cybersecurity field. Additionally, a number of online cybersecurity labs
    are available, both free and paid, but this chapter focused on the free labs that
    anyone can perform without spending a dime. The first lab is an XSS exercise that
    can be used to figure out whether a website has components that are vulnerable
    to XSS. The next lab is an SSL test to check whether a website is running on a
    server with misconfigured SSL. The third test is a cloud-based vulnerability scan
    that can be used to detect more than 4,500 vulnerabilities in web applications.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The fourth lab is a malware scanning tool that could be used to detect whether
    a website has any known malware, outdated software, or other security errors.
    The fifth tool is more comprehensive, as it features a platform offering a number
    of cybersecurity challenges that a user can try solving. The sixth lab is a network
    security tool that cybersecurity professionals can use to check whether a router
    is a victim of DNS hijacking. The seventh is another comprehensive lab where users
    can participate in a number of challenges from an attacker's perspective and exploit
    vulnerabilities in dummy targets. The eighth lab focuses on password security
    and gives learners a chance to try and generate passwords that users are likely
    to create and use in systems. Here, you can check a number of parameters and provide
    certain characters that are likely to be in a password, and the tool will generate
    highly-probable passwords.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The ninth lab is a gamification cybersecurity training platform in which the
    user can create systems and defend them from attacks. Alongside this, they can
    also attack systems created by other users on the platform. The last lab was a
    tool from Mozilla, called Mozilla Observatory. The tool is a website security
    scanner that generates in-depth reports on the vulnerabilities that are on a website.
    These labs are a sure way for a cybersecurity enthusiast to continue learning
    and assess their skills. Some of the labs might not be too engaging, as they feature
    automated tests. However, the reports generated are important. You should try
    and find out how the details contained in the lab reports affect the website.

- en: Finally, there are many other cybersecurity training platforms that you can
    use to advance your knowledge. Some of the best platforms charge a premium to
    allow you to carry out simulations, but it could be worthwhile trying out these
    premium platforms. However, you should at least consider doing a number of the
    free labs to get a preview of what to expect from the premium tools. Cybersecurity
    is quite involving, and a career in this field will always be filled with new
    learning opportunities. You should, therefore, be proactive in trying out any
    other security lab that you come across.
