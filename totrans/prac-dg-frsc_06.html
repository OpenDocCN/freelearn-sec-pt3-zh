It will outline the key stages of digital evidence selection and analysis in line with accepted forensic standards. The chapter will look at:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The use of structured processes to navigate acquired forensic images to locate and select evidence based on sound forensic practices</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The emergence of forensic tools that reduce the tedium and time spent on analysis and that retrieve more evidence</li></ul></div><div class="section" title="Structured processes to locate and select digital evidence"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl1sec48"/>Structured processes to locate and select digital evidence</h1></div></div></div><p>Various <a id="id439" class="indexterm"/>digital forensic examination models are in use, each emphasizing slightly different stages in the investigation process, with no universally agreed-upon model used by practitioners. I have examined <a id="id440" class="indexterm"/>the structure of each model and propose that a typical digital forensic examination may be divided into the evidence-recovery and preservation stage and then locating, sorting, selecting, and analyzing the evidence recovered that may support (or refute) a legal argument. The <a id="id441" class="indexterm"/>next stage is validating the evidence, ensuring that it is what it purports to be. The final stage is presenting the selected evidence in a <a id="id442" class="indexterm"/>formal report. This may be to the legal team or the investigator or may be made by the practitioner testifying during a legal hearing.</p><p>The examination is often an iterative process, in that the various stages may be revisited before the examination is finally concluded. For example, another device that may be recovered later will require data recovery and preservation of the data, as was described in detail in <a class="link" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Recovering and Preserving Digital Evidence">Chapter 4</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Recovering and Preserving Digital Evidence</em></span>.</p><p>Recovery and preservation has traditionally involved the imaging of devices and storing the data in bulk in a forensic file or, more securely, in a forensic image container, notably the ILookIX <code class="literal">.ASB</code> container. <a class="link" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. The Need for Enhanced Forensic Tools">Chapter 5</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>The Need for Enhanced Forensic Tools</em></span>, described the <a id="id443" class="indexterm"/>recovery of smaller, more manageable datasets from larger datasets from a device or network system using the ISeekDiscovery automaton. Whether the practitioner examines an<a id="id444" class="indexterm"/> image container or an extraction of information in the ISeekDiscovery <code class="literal">.ISK</code> container, it should be possible to overview the recovered information and develop a clearer perception of the type of evidence that should be located. Using a structured process to locate the evidence makes the certainty of locating it more likely and the process less arduous than using an unstructured approach.</p><p>Once acquired, the<a id="id445" class="indexterm"/> image or device may be searched to find evidence. Locating evidence requires a degree of analysis combined with practitioner knowledge and experience. As outlined in <a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Hardware and Software Environments">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Hardware and Software Environments</em></span>, evidence may be located in a broad range of devices and in various locations on those devices. Information of interest may be located in the e-mail folder, containing messages and attachments of interest to an investigator. The process of <a id="id446" class="indexterm"/>selection involves analysis, and as new leads open up, the search for more evidence intensifies until ultimately a thorough search process is completed.</p><p>The searching process involves the analysis of possible evidence, from which evidence may be discarded, collected, or tagged for later re-examination, thereby instigating the selection process. It must be stressed that the selection of candidate evidence by the practitioner does not mean that it is proof of guilt or innocence—it simply means that the evidence selected appears to be relevant to and supportive of the matter at hand. This means that the evidence supports or adds to a legal argument or hypothesis—the ultimate <span class="emphasis"><em>probandum</em></span> of a case, such as the defendant using the computer to strike the deceased's head, resulting in his demise! Some theorists and practitioners have a clearly defined stage in their models they call analysis, but that may be somewhat confusing as analysis is part of all stages and not really a separate process.</p><p>The following diagram is a simple model proposed by me, which highlights the examination of digital evidence in the investigative and legal domains. The penultimate stage of the investigative process is the validation of the evidence, aimed at determining its reliability, relevance, authenticity, accuracy, and completeness. The final stage is the presentation of the evidence to interested parties, such as the investigators, the legal team, and, ultimately, the legal adjudicating body. Evidence validation is covered in more detail in <a class="link" href="ch09.html" title="Chapter 9. Validating the Evidence">Chapter 9</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Validating the Evidence</em></span>. Once the legal process is completed, the digital evidence containers and digital devices may require safe storage pending the outcome of any review or legal appeal:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04931_06_01.jpg" alt="Structured processes to locate and select digital evidence"/><div class="caption"><p>My digital forensic examination model</p></div></div><p>The <a id="id447" class="indexterm"/>following <a id="id448" class="indexterm"/>subsections describe the<a id="id449" class="indexterm"/> evidence <a id="id450" class="indexterm"/>searching and selection processes.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Locating digital evidence"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl1sec49"/>Locating digital evidence</h1></div></div></div><p>Locating evidence <a id="id451" class="indexterm"/>from the all-too-common large dataset requires some filtration of extraneous material, which has until recently been a mainly manual task of sorting the wheat from the chaff. But it is important to clear the clutter and noise of busy operating systems and applications, from which only a small amount of evidence really needs to be gleaned. This section describes the processes involved that practitioners follow in their endeavors to locate relevant material to assist an investigation.</p><div class="section" title="Search processes"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec100"/>Search processes</h2></div></div></div><p>Search processes<a id="id452" class="indexterm"/> involve searching in a filesystem and inside files; common searches for files are based on:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Their names or patterns in their names</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Keywords in their content</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Temporal data (metadata), such as the last-accessed or last-written time</li></ul></div><p>A pragmatic approach to the examination is necessary, where the onus is on the practitioner to create a list of keywords or search terms to cull specific, probative, and case-related information from very large groups of files. The advanced search terms in ISeekDesigner provide practitioners with a high level of flexibility to locate evidence, notably the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Plain search</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Case-sensitive plain search</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Whole-word search</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Case-sensitive whole-word search</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Regex search</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Case-insensitive regex search</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Wildcard search</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Hex sequence search</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Beginning-of-word search</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Case-sensitive beginning-of-word search</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">End-of-word search</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Case-sensitive end-of-word search</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Disabled</li></ul></div><p>Hashing is used to compare the signature of files against a range of databases that include malware and child exploitation material. It can also assist in locating files on a suspect computer against previously known signatures. For example, locating a forged text document held on one computer and suspected to be on another was made possible by using the hash of the file contents, despite the file extension and name being changed to conceal the forgery.</p></div><div class="section" title="Searching desktops and laptops"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec101"/>Searching desktops and laptops</h2></div></div></div><p>The next figure shows a <a id="id453" class="indexterm"/>computer terminal linked to the Internet <a id="id454" class="indexterm"/>via a modem. Various peripheral devices are attached: a scanner, printer, external hard drive, thumb drive, storage device, digital camera, and mobile phone. In an office network, this would be a more complicated system. A typical household may include local area networks and a range of users and their digital devices. The linked connections between the devices and <a id="id455" class="indexterm"/>the Internet through the terminal leave a range <a id="id456" class="indexterm"/>of traces and logging records in the terminal and on some of the devices and the Internet. E-mail messages will be recorded externally on the e-mail server; the printer may keep a record of print jobs; the external storage devices and the communication media also leave logs and data linked to the terminal. All of this data may assist in the reconstruction of key events and provide evidence related to the investigation:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04931_06_02.jpg" alt="Searching desktops and laptops"/><div class="caption"><p>A typical single-terminal network</p></div></div><p>If we look at the data stored on the terminal, which may be a desktop, laptop, or netbook, traces of relevant data may be located there. In the following diagram, we have recovered a deleted MS Word document from <span class="strong"><strong>Recycle Bin</strong></span>, containing a death threat to another person.</p><p>The intended victim has reported receiving an e-mail message with a Word document attachment from the suspect, whose computer was later seized for examination. In this hypothetical scenario (based on an actual case), the practitioner's task is to locate evidence of the e-mail message and attachment. This simple task may reveal the e-mail file and attachment, but it may only locate traces of the message:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04931_06_03.jpg" alt="Searching desktops and laptops"/><div class="caption"><p>A relationship between a recovered evidence artifact and its correlation with other artifacts</p></div></div><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note09"/>Note</h3><p>Anomalies in timestamp metadata may also complicate the reconstruction of key events.</p></div></div><p>In this <a id="id457" class="indexterm"/>scenario, we have an e-mail message that may <a id="id458" class="indexterm"/>have a number of relationships with other files that record events that seem to link to the e-mail message and are within the relevant time frame. From this recovered file, it is possible to reconstruct a timeline based on relevant timestamps and the locations of the additional files. This will assist in the more complete selection of useful information to assist in the analysis of the threads of evidence. This will be looked at in more detail in the following subsection on evidence selection, but first, it is important for the practitioner to know where to look for helpful leads.</p><p>From this simple yet common scenario, note that the file does not exist in isolation. There is related information that should be located—and within a period corresponding to the creation and transmission of the e-mail message. Firstly, it is expedient to look for other information that correlates with the e-mail message; information that may clarify:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">When the message was created and posted</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Whether it was created and dispatched on the suspect's computer</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Where the attachment was created</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">When the attachment was created</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The identity of the user who created the Word document</li></ul></div><p>The previous <a id="id459" class="indexterm"/>diagram highlights that there are what <a id="id460" class="indexterm"/>appear to be related events based on deleted files and applications that created or modified these files, which are as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The Deleted e-mail folder held the deleted e-mail and attachment</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Recycle Bin held a deleted folder and a deleted version of the threatening Word document that was previously located on the computer desktop</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The Word document file contained metadata relating to the previous location of the file and its recorded author</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">A link file (or Jump List log) refers to the location of the file of the same name in this folder that was previously located on the desktop</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Microsoft Word is installed and shows a record of the creation and modification of a file with the same name in a recent document log</li></ul></div><p>Files created, modified, transferred, or stored on a computer will often leave a trail of links that record its presence on the device. They often contain metadata, including authorship, file location, and timestamps, which may help in event reconstruction, and they certainly assist in locating such links. The following screenshot shows the <span class="strong"><strong>Quick access</strong></span> feature in the <span class="strong"><strong>File Explorer</strong></span> pane. In this example, it shows frequent folders accessed by users of the computer. The screenshot displays folders and an individual file, which is a typical default setting. By booting up the forensic image of the device, this may be readily observed, and it cannot contaminate evidence on the original device:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04931_06_04.jpg" alt="Searching desktops and laptops"/><div class="caption"><p>The Windows 10 Quick access feature</p></div></div><p>However, this <a id="id461" class="indexterm"/>data is stored in Jump List files since the launch of Windows 7 and intended to assist users with quick and convenient access to<a id="id462" class="indexterm"/> files and applications at various locations in the computer. During the physical examination of a device, Jump List details may be accessed in Windows Registry at <code class="literal">HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Advanced\Start_JumpListItems</code>.</p><p>These Windows proprietary files, known as <span class="strong"><strong>Object Linking and Embedding</strong></span>, embed and link documents and applications for quick retrieval and may be located in Windows 10 folders such as <code class="literal">C:\Users\LCDI\AppData\Roaming\Microsoftg\Windows\Recent\</code>.</p><p>Jump Lists are compartmentalized into two directories:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>AutomaticDestinations</strong></span>: These are created by the operating system and other default applications that contain the <code class="literal">DestList</code> stream recording the most recently or frequently used files</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>CustomDestinations</strong></span>: These files are created when a user pins an application to the taskbar or <span class="strong"><strong>Start</strong></span> menu, for example, in Windows 10</li></ul></div><p>Careful analysis <a id="id463" class="indexterm"/>of these files may assist in determining<a id="id464" class="indexterm"/> the number of times the file was accessed and the dates when that occurred.

The previous screenshot, for example, indicates a correlation between a recovered artifact and corroborating artifacts. It is critical to show that such additional events occurred or could have occurred during the relevant time frame. Windows 10 has an abundance of links to frequently and recently used files, as shown in the Smart Screen feature in the following screenshot, which shows a link to a Yahoo! Mail account and a number of recently visited websites:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04931_06_09.jpg" alt="Searching desktops and laptops"/><div class="caption"><p>The Start Up form showing a list of frequently visited sites</p></div></div><p>Using the<a id="id469" class="indexterm"/> logical examination process (booting up the image), we can see, in the example shown in the following screenshot, a <a id="id470" class="indexterm"/>deleted file in <span class="strong"><strong>Recycle Bin</strong></span> that was previously on the computer <span class="strong"><strong>Desktop</strong></span>.

This feature is switched on in most browsers as a default setting but will be deactivated if the user has chosen to browse in private mode to avoid leaving history logs:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04931_06_11.jpg" alt="Searching desktops and laptops"/><div class="caption"><p>Mozilla Firefox browsing history</p></div></div><p>This screenshot<a id="id473" class="indexterm"/> shows a similar history list<a id="id474" class="indexterm"/> recovered from IE browser history:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04931_06_12.jpg" alt="Searching desktops and laptops"/><div class="caption"><p>IE browser history</p></div></div><p>It may not <a id="id475" class="indexterm"/>always be possible to boot up a forensic image<a id="id476" class="indexterm"/> and view it in its logical format, which is easier and more familiar to users. However, viewing the data inside a forensic image provides, in its physical form, unaltered metadata and files that provide accurate information about applications and files. To elaborate, as shown in the following screenshot, it is possible to view the containers that hold these histories and search records that have been recovered and stored in a forensic file container:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04931_06_13.jpg" alt="Searching desktops and laptops"/><div class="caption"><p>A list of containers recovered, including the browser history database</p></div></div><p>ILookIX has <a id="id477" class="indexterm"/>recovered and deconstructed the containers to reveal their contents, as shown in the following screenshot. The <a id="id478" class="indexterm"/>contents in this case are spreadsheets (<code class="literal">.CSV</code> files) that may be viewed with ILookIX or exported for further analysis and presentation as evidence during trial. The file and folder locations are stated along with the timestamps they had at the time of imaging. The disadvantage of viewing files in the logical environment is that the process of booting and using various applications alters the metadata.</p><p>Even though the image is write-protected and any such alterations are non-persistent, the view presented also shows the current alterations to the metadata and removes the original timestamp. For example, the last-accessed dates will be altered to the current time of the viewing of the file once the file has been opened by the practitioner:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04931_06_14.jpg" alt="Searching desktops and laptops"/><div class="caption"><p>Spreadsheets and a list of contents extracted from the browser history database</p></div></div><p>The <a id="id479" class="indexterm"/>practitioner should have some understanding of the nature of the transgression and some of the key "players". The case may center on <a id="id480" class="indexterm"/>e-mail or chat messaging, or it may relate to browsing activities of the suspect and so forth. If examining Skype communications, for example, it is helpful to locate the database file that records chat logs, which are usually <code class="literal">.CSV</code> spreadsheet files. The file is <code class="literal">main.db</code> and is usually located in the specific user's directory folder.</p><p>The short extract shown here provides details of the names of the Skype accounts used, timestamps of each message, and the content:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04931_06_15.jpg" alt="Searching desktops and laptops"/><div class="caption"><p>A spreadsheet of message conversations extracted from the Skype database—heavily culled</p></div></div><p>It is prudent to assume that the users of the accounts may not necessarily be the account owners. To establish the identity of the person using the application at the time may require some compelling corroboration. For example, the identity of the user could be established by some form of triangulation of the device with other digital devices. This could be using tracking data of the user's mobile phone that has shown it to be in the same location as the computer used to communicate with others.</p><p>Other cases <a id="id481" class="indexterm"/>have involved recovering <a id="id482" class="indexterm"/>personal information disclosed during communications that has been recorded in the conversation logs, known only to the communicator or a small number of close friends or relatives. The identity of the user may be established by other persons present who witnessed the user at the keyboard and observed the Skype communication on the computer monitor at a time relevant to the transgression. Skype and other messaging systems such as Kik and Whatsapp are a rich source of information that is potentially stored on computers and mobile phones. Video clips, pictures, audio, text, and voice calls may all be linked to these widely used applications.</p><p>The next screenshot shows spreadsheets recovered from a MacBook Air, which provides details of messages exchanged and the names of the user accounts involved. The <span class="strong"><strong>MediaDocuments </strong></span>file provided details of illegal pictures sent between two parties to the conversation that were later recovered from the Recycle Bin:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04931_06_16.jpg" alt="Searching desktops and laptops"/><div class="caption"><p>Spreadsheets extracted from the Skype database contained in a MacBook Air</p></div></div></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Selecting digital evidence"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl1sec50"/>Selecting digital evidence</h1></div></div></div><p>The <a id="id483" class="indexterm"/>next stage in the examination process is to select and analyze the evidence that will form part of a legal case. For those unfamiliar with investigations, it is quite common to misread readily available evidence and draw incorrect conclusions. Business managers attempting to analyze what they consider are the facts of a case would be wise to seek legal assistance in selecting and evaluating evidence on which they may wish to base a case.</p><p>Selecting the evidence, sometimes referred to as the analysis stage or event reconstruction stage, involves analysis of the located evidence to determine what events occurred in the system and their significance and probative value to the case. The selection analysis stage requires practitioners to carefully examine the available digital evidence, ensuring that they do not misinterpret the evidence and make imprudent presumptions without carefully cross-checking the information. It is a fact-finding process, where attempts are made to develop a plausible reconstruction of the facts. It may be expedient to liaise with the investigation and legal teams to ensure that relevant and probative information is selected.</p><p>As in <a id="id484" class="indexterm"/>conventional crime investigations, practitioners should look for evidence that suggests or indicates the <span class="emphasis"><em>motive</em></span> (why?), <span class="emphasis"><em>means</em></span> (how?), and <span class="emphasis"><em>opportunity</em></span> (when?) of suspected offenders. In cases dependent on digital evidence, it can be a vexatious process to determine this. However, it is important for the practitioner to be aware of seeking clarification of the three fundamental components of crimes while at the same time remaining neutral and dispassionate as to the likelihood of a suspect's guilt.</p><div class="section" title="Seeking the truth"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec102"/>Seeking the truth</h2></div></div></div><p>The primary <a id="id485" class="indexterm"/>role of the practitioner when seeking the truth of a matter under investigation includes locating evidence that supports the preliminary hypothesis, but just as important is locating evidence that refutes the hypothesis. This is also known as <a id="id486" class="indexterm"/>
<span class="strong"><strong>exculpatory evidence</strong></span>. It is important to stress that in the interest of justice, even the most hard-pressed practitioner must always keep this requirement in mind and comply with it under all circumstances.</p><p>Law enforcement agents seek a conviction and are often preoccupied with selecting the lowest-hanging fruit. This is referred to as cherry-picking and is selective, biased, and can sometimes lead to important evidence being located that may challenge other evidence. Any prosecutor worthy of presenting a case in court always looks for the weaknesses in the prosecution case, primarily as a strategy to deflect a counterattack. In the interest of justice, all evidence procured by the prosecution that has a bearing on a case must be shared with the other party. For the defense team, the requirement to reciprocate varies in different jurisdictions and is based on the adversarial court process of the prosecution having to prove that the defendant is guilty, not for the defendant to prove innocence.</p><p>Trials increasingly rely on digital evidence, and there are documented cases where the innocent are convicted, hence the need for a high level of certainty that the evidence is valid. This is described in more detail in <a class="link" href="ch09.html" title="Chapter 9. Validating the Evidence">Chapter 9</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Validating the Evidence</em></span>.</p><p>Some order is required during the process rather than taking a haphazard approach. It is important to define the general characteristics of the evidence being searched for and then look for the object in a collection of data. For example, if searching for an image file, say a JPEG file, the practitioner would look for all images with the <code class="literal">.jpeg</code> extension. In the case previously mentioned that involved the recovery of incriminating Skype chat messages that had illegal pictures posted by the two parties, the attachments had been saved and later deleted, most likely to prevent detection. A sample of the deleted pictures in PNG format, shown in the next screenshot, was recovered from the user's protected and hidden folders. They were readily identified, as the name of the file incorporated the date and time when each file was saved to the MacBook Air. These timestamps correlated with<a id="id487" class="indexterm"/> the chat message logs and were used to reconstruct these communications more fully. This was a circumstantial but compelling relationship that contributed to a just outcome in this case:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04931_06_17.jpg" alt="Seeking the truth"/><div class="caption"><p>Screenshot of pictures recovered from a suspect's hidden folder</p></div></div><p>As the investigation proceeds, the practitioner will develop various hypotheses as to the nature of the transgression and possible suspects. The practitioner looks for data that supports or refutes hypotheses about the incident. Timestamps, for example, may be changed in most systems; therefore, it is helpful to locate log entries, network traffic, and other events internal and external to the suspect computer. This information may then be used to triangulate the accuracy and reliability of the data of relevance to the overall investigation.</p><p>Examination of the evidence involves the use of a potentially large number of techniques to find and interpret significant data. It may require the repair or salvage of damaged data in ways that preserve its integrity and potential usefulness. What the practitioner must always be aware of is that evidence distinguishes a hypothesis from a groundless assertion—it may confirm or disprove a hypothesis. Therefore, reliability and integrity are key to its admissibility and weight in a court of law, and this must be heeded during the selection process.</p><p>There are <a id="id488" class="indexterm"/>often too many potential suspects, and linking a suspect to the incriminating events is not always as straightforward as it may seem at first glance. The following diagram shows a typical family network setup using Wi-Fi connections to the home modem that facilitates connection to the Internet. In this example, based on a real case, the parents provided the broadband service for themselves and for three other family members. One of the children's friends completed a university assignment on the child's computer and synchronized their iPad to the child's device:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04931_06_18.jpg" alt="Seeking the truth"/><div class="caption"><p>The complexity of a typical household network and determining the identity of the transgressor</p></div></div><p>This scenario lends itself to exploitation as other family members and friends visiting the residence have unrestricted access to the children's computers and, through them, contact with the Internet. The Wi-Fi connection is also vulnerable to being hijacked, and external rogue attackers are capable of gaining access to and control of the small local network. Assuming one of the devices contains incriminating data, the questions that must be asked are how it got there, who put it there, and, possibly, why it was done.</p><p>With traditional offenses, the offending act or event is usually manifested—there is a corpse, a theft, or at least a complaint to work with and, usually, a list of potential suspects, based on these criteria:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Who knew the victim?</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Who had physical access to the scene?</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Who had a motive?</li></ul></div><p>The <a id="id489" class="indexterm"/>Internet, for example, may offer over 700 million suspects according to connectivity. It should not be assumed that the owner of the computer that holds incriminating data or other family members in this scenario are the only suspects. Clearly, this is a natural, intuitive assumption, but a dangerous one if in fact it can be shown that others had access to the terminal at the relevant time.</p><p>It is sometimes problematic to identify the crime during the selection process. Here are some examples:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">In cybercrime, the nature of the event is often less obvious and immediate</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">If a hacker steals confidential information, victims may not find out what has been stolen</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Victims usually rely on being informed by system administrators</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The administrators may not notice until long after the event—as evinced in the case study at the end of the chapter</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Identity theft fraud, the fastest-growing financial crime, may take years to be exposed</li></ul></div><p>The practitioner should also consider the quality of the evidence during selection and take heed that digital evidence is circumstantial and often involves the examination of a large amount of data that may prove to be irrelevant to the investigation. It rarely provides sufficient weight by itself to prove guilt or innocence unless soundly corroborated.</p><p>The next section looks at emerging tools that help in the evidence-selection process.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="More effective forensic tools"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl1sec51"/>More effective forensic tools</h1></div></div></div><p>Various <a id="id490" class="indexterm"/>forensic tools are available to assist the practitioner to select and collate data for examination analysis and investigation. Sorting order from the chaos of even a small personal computer can be a time-consuming and complex process. As the digital forensic discipline develops, better and more reliable forensic tools are being developed to assist practitioners locate, select, and collate evidence from larger, complex datasets. It should be pointed out that in many cases, more than one device is involved, and they require examination as well. This of course adds to the challenge of the overall forensic examination.</p><p>The following subsections show how the<a id="id491" class="indexterm"/> data can be organized through a range of managed processes.</p><div class="section" title="Categorizing files"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec103"/>Categorizing files</h2></div></div></div><p>To <a id="id492" class="indexterm"/>varying degrees, most digital forensic tools used to view and analyze forensic images or attached devices provide helpful user interfaces to locate and categorize information relevant to the examination.</p><p>The most advanced application that provides access and convenient viewing of files is the <span class="strong"><strong>Category Explorer</strong></span> feature in ILookIX, as shown in this screenshot; it divides files by <span class="strong"><strong>Type</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Signature</strong></span>, and <span class="strong"><strong>Properties</strong></span>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04931_06_19.jpg" alt="Categorizing files"/><div class="caption"><p>ILookIX Category Explorer</p></div></div><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Category Explorer</strong></span> also allows the practitioner to create custom categories called <span class="strong"><strong>My Categories</strong></span> to group files by relevance. For example, in a criminal investigation involving a conspiracy, the practitioner could create a category for the first individual and one for the second individual. As files are reviewed, they would then be added to either or both <a id="id493" class="indexterm"/>categories. Unlike tags, files can be added to multiple categories, and the categories can be given descriptive names.</p><p>To add a file or group of files to a category, the practitioner may select as desired one or more files in the <span class="strong"><strong>File List</strong></span>. Selecting the <span class="strong"><strong>Save Selected File(s) to a Category</strong></span> button brings up the <span class="strong"><strong>My Categories</strong></span> window. The following screenshot shows all currently existing categories (including those created during the initial case creation); the examiner is given the option to add new or delete redundant categories. In this screenshot, the files selected for inclusion in the category are Skype messaging files. The <span class="strong"><strong>My Categories</strong></span> folder can be viewed and accessed conveniently in the <span class="strong"><strong>Category Explorer</strong></span> window, allowing the practitioner to select, edit, deselect, and later export the files as part of the case preparation:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04931_06_20.jpg" alt="Categorizing files"/><div class="caption"><p>The ILookIX My Categories feature</p></div></div><p>It is common during evidence selection to find some tantalizing information and later forget where it was located, consequently wasting much time trying to relocate it and follow up any essential leads it may offer. Adding files of possible relevance to various containers within this application minimizes unnecessary repetition of the process. It also offers the practitioner the opportunity of pigeonholing interesting snippets of information for future analysis. This avoids the problem of being waylaid too early in the selection process <a id="id494" class="indexterm"/>by looking at interesting leads that may detract from a more formal search for the key evidence.</p></div><div class="section" title="Eliminating superfluous files"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec104"/>Eliminating superfluous files</h2></div></div></div><p>The <a id="id495" class="indexterm"/>prospect of trawling for evidence through large numbers of files located on computers could be compared with being unable to see the trees for the forest, let alone seeing any wood (evidence). Computers store many of the same files in duplicate, triplicate, or more versions, which are often scattered in various obscure parts of the system. Files with no content or zero-length files also add to the clutter; eliminating these files by hiding them from view can significantly reduce the ones that need to be searched manually or by automated applications.</p><p>The ILookIX <span class="strong"><strong>Data Reduction</strong></span> feature, shown in the following screenshot, allows the elimination of files from view, but these files have not been destroyed and can be returned to the case at any time. When they are in an eliminated category, they will not appear in any lists, and processes such as indexing, hashing, and searching will not be run against them. ILookIX allows files to be eliminated through a number of processes. These include running a hash elimination or hash deduplication process or manually eliminating files based on type or path. File elimination is usually used to remove files from an image before processing to speed it up, and it is also used to suppress duplicate files. Hash deduplication can be used prior to review to ensure that the reviewer is given only one copy of each file of interest, instead of multiple identical copies under different names:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04931_06_21.jpg" alt="Eliminating superfluous files"/><div class="caption"><p>The ILookIX Data Reduction feature</p></div></div><p>ILookIX's <span class="strong"><strong>Hash Set Manager</strong></span> allows the examiner to review loaded hash sets and determine for each whether it is active for file elimination, hash search, or both. Its <span class="strong"><strong>Hash Elimination</strong></span> function takes all of the files in the case that have been hashed, compares them <a id="id496" class="indexterm"/>against all of the hash values for the hash sets selected for elimination, and transfers the matching files to the <span class="strong"><strong>Hash Eliminated Files/E-mail</strong></span> category. The <span class="strong"><strong>Hash De-duplication</strong></span> function takes all of the files in the case that have been hashed, compares their hash values, and sends all but one copy of each file to the <span class="strong"><strong>Hash Eliminated Files/E-mail</strong></span> category.</p><p>Once the files are in this category, they will no longer appear in any list of files or e-mail unless the examiner selects the <span class="strong"><strong>Hash Elimination</strong></span> category to view the files, or selects a file within the category and restores the file.</p></div><div class="section" title="Deconstructing files"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec105"/>Deconstructing files</h2></div></div></div><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Deconstructable files</strong></span> are <a id="id497" class="indexterm"/>compound files that can be further broken down into smaller parts, such as e-mail, archives, thumb stores, and files. Once deconstruction is complete, the files will either be classified as deconstructed files or deconstruction failed files. ILookIX's built-in file deconstruction allows the practitioner to deconstruct a range of complex files during the processing of an image or attached device, as shown here:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04931_06_22.jpg" alt="Deconstructing files"/><div class="caption"><p>ILookIX Data Deconstruction feature</p></div></div><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note10"/>Note</h3><p>The deconstruction of files involves processing compound files such as archive, e-mail store, registry store, or other files to extract useful and usable data from a complex file format and generate reports. Manual deconstruction adds significantly to the time required to complete an examination.</p></div></div></div><div class="section" title="Searching for files"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec106"/>Searching for files</h2></div></div></div><p>Depending <a id="id498" class="indexterm"/>on the type of image being mapped and the options selected, it can take a considerable amount of time to make data available to the examiner. Options that take the most time upfront are hashing, indexing, and salvaging. Depending on the purpose of the examination, the time consumed by these activities should be weighed against the future time savings. Hashing, for example, can significantly reduce the number of superfluous files to be reviewed by the examiner. Indexing saves time in almost any examination in which multiple keyword searches are needed.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note11"/>Note</h3><p>Indexing is the process whereby chunks of data are catalogued. It is the process of generating a table of text strings that can then be searched almost instantly any number of times.</p></div></div><p>The two main uses of indexing are to create a dictionary to use when cracking passwords and to index words for almost-instant searching. Indexing is also valuable when creating a dictionary or when using any of the analysis functions built in to ILookIX. ILookIX facilitates indexing of the entire media at the time of initial processing, all at once. It can also be done after processing. Indexing facilitates searching through files and archives, Windows Registry, e-mail lists, and unallocated space. This function is highly customizable via the setup option and can be optimized for searching or for creating a custom dictionary for password cracking.</p><p>Sound indexing ensures speedy and accurate searching. Searching is the process of looking through the evidence for a specific item, such as a string of text or an expression. An expression, in terms of searching, is a pattern used to structure data in a search, such as a credit card number or e-mail address. ILookIX offers a comprehensive range of searches, including keyword searches, which simply look for certain characters on disk.</p><p>This type of search will miss files within compound files if they are not deconstructed into their constituent parts first, that is, mails within PSTs or <code class="literal">.docx</code> and <code class="literal">.xlsx</code> files within zipped archives. The indexed search is fast and reliable, as the prior indexing process has eliminated the need for repeated and time-consuming searches over the entire drive or image.</p><p>ILookIX's <span class="strong"><strong>Search History</strong></span> view displays historical records of all searches undertaken in the case and allows the investigator to send the results of any historical search back to the ILookIX <span class="strong"><strong>List Pane</strong></span> at a later date, as shown in the next screenshot. Examples of search results and files <a id="id499" class="indexterm"/>located are illustrated later in this section:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04931_06_23.jpg" alt="Searching for files"/><div class="caption"><p>The ILookIX List Pane showing the results of various searches</p></div></div></div><div class="section" title="The Event Analysis tool"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec107"/>The Event Analysis tool</h2></div></div></div><p>ILookIX's <a id="id500" class="indexterm"/>
<span class="strong"><strong>Event Analysis</strong></span> tool provides the practitioner with a graphical representation of events on the subject system, such as the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">File creation, access, or modification times</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">E-mails sent or received</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Other events, such as the modification of the Master File Table on an NTFS system</li></ul></div><p>The graph itself shows the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Time (in months) along the <code class="literal">X</code> axis</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The number of items along the <code class="literal">Y</code> axis</li></ul></div><p>The events are color-coded by event type, with the total of each type of event displayed above the bar for that month's events, as shown here:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04931_06_24.jpg" alt="The Event Analysis tool"/><div class="caption"><p>ILookIX Event Viewer showing events between selected dates</p></div></div><p>The <a id="id501" class="indexterm"/>application allows the practitioner to zoom in on any point on the graph to view more specific details, as shown here:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04931_06_25.jpg" alt="The Event Analysis tool"/><div class="caption"><p>ILookIX Event Viewer showing last-accessed times</p></div></div><p>Left-clicking on any bar on the graph will return the view to the main ILookIX window and display<a id="id502" class="indexterm"/> the items from the date bar selected in the <span class="strong"><strong>List Pane</strong></span>. A sample of such results is shown in the following screenshot. This can be most helpful when analyzing events during specific periods:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04931_06_26.jpg" alt="The Event Analysis tool"/><div class="caption"><p>ILookIX Event Viewer displaying extracted files for review</p></div></div></div><div class="section" title="The Cloud Analysis tool"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec108"/>The Cloud Analysis tool</h2></div></div></div><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>Cloud Analysis</strong></span> tool <a id="id503" class="indexterm"/>embedded in ILookIX is a visual representation of the frequency with which individual words appear in a case. The analysis is based on the current index database, so the practitioner must index the case data prior to initiating an analysis. The analysis is presented in data cloud form, removing the complexity of the underlying analysis and presenting the practitioner with an easy-to-understand picture of the analysis.</p><p>In the top-right section of the <span class="strong"><strong>Cloud Analysis</strong></span> viewer, shown in the following screenshot, there is a <span class="strong"><strong>Highlight List</strong></span> to help organize groups of case words under easy-to-remember headings. This is so the analysis brings these words immediately to the practitioner's attention with no special effort required to find them:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04931_06_27.jpg" alt="The Cloud Analysis tool"/><div class="caption"><p>ILookIX Cloud Analysis searching for relevant terms</p></div></div><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Cloud Analysis</strong></span> has a <a id="id504" class="indexterm"/>number of features designed to make it easy to refine analysis and bring case-relevant data to the fore. Since it is based on index data and takes only a simple click to initiate, functionality issues are the only ones that must be described. Since the display generated is an interactive pictorial, the user can interact with selections by left-clicking on the words one at a time. It is then possible to initiate a search of that word selection by a simple double-click on the word.</p><p>In the following example shown, the search word selected was <span class="strong"><strong>fireworks</strong></span>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04931_06_28.jpg" alt="The Cloud Analysis tool"/><div class="caption"><p>A Cloud Analysis search result for the word "fireworks"</p></div></div><p>Selecting that search history entry will in turn reveal a file-list response of all objects containing that<a id="id505" class="indexterm"/> term, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04931_06_29.jpg" alt="The Cloud Analysis tool"/><div class="caption"><p>Search results displayed for the word "fireworks"</p></div></div></div><div class="section" title="The Lead Analysis tool"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec109"/>The Lead Analysis tool</h2></div></div></div><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>Lead Analysis</strong></span> tool is <a id="id506" class="indexterm"/>an interactive evidence model embedded in ILookIX that allows the practitioner to assimilate known facts into a graphic representation that directly links unseen objects. It provides the answers as the practitioner increases the detail of the design surface and brings into view specific relationships that could otherwise go unseen.</p><p>The primary aim of <span class="strong"><strong>Lead Analysis</strong></span> is to help discover links within the case data that may not be evident or intuitive and which the practitioner may not be aware of directly or has little background knowledge of to help form relationships manually. Instead of finding and making notes of various pieces of information, the analysis is presented as an easy-to-use link model. The complexity of the modeling is removed; we get the clearest possible method of discovery. The analysis is based on the current index database and, again, it is essential to index case data prior to initiating an analysis.</p><p>The application interface will initially be blank, as shown in the following screenshot. In the center of the analysis dialogue is the canvas: this is the main modeling area for evidential links. To the left is the <span class="strong"><strong>Lead Objects</strong></span> section: these objects may be dragged onto the <span class="strong"><strong>Canvas</strong></span> to set up start points for the analysis or to manually model linkage. In the top right is the <span class="strong"><strong>Potential Links</strong></span> list. In the bottom right is the <span class="strong"><strong>Skip List</strong></span>. This is a same global <span class="strong"><strong>Skip List</strong></span> that is also used by the application:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04931_06_30.jpg" alt="The Lead Analysis tool"/><div class="caption"><p>ILookIX Lead Analysis</p></div></div><p>The first task<a id="id507" class="indexterm"/> is to state some facts about the case and to use these as the starting point of the analysis. These facts may be stated by establishing start points on the canvas, by dragging lead objects from the <span class="strong"><strong>Lead Objects</strong></span> section onto the canvas. Then, the user may pick a lead object that represents the piece of information of relevance or concept and drag it onto the canvas. Then, by clicking on the object's text tag, it will shift into edit mode and replace the default text with something specific to the lead, such as a person's surname. Right-clicking on the avatar and then on <span class="strong"><strong>Find Links</strong></span> collates a list of words that appear to be associated with the name of the avatar, as shown here:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04931_06_31.jpg" alt="The Lead Analysis tool"/><div class="caption"><p>ILookIX Lead Analysis creating the avatar node</p></div></div><p>Once a list of potential links has been generated, it is important to review them to see whether any are potentially relevant. By highlighting any that are and then clicking on the green <span class="strong"><strong>Link Transfer</strong></span> button on the Mini Toolbar of the <span class="strong"><strong>Potential Links</strong></span>, it is possible to look for words in the catalogs if they have been included. In the example scenario shown in the following screenshot, the word <span class="strong"><strong>divorce</strong></span> was located as it was known that <span class="strong"><strong>Sarah</strong></span> was divorced<a id="id508" class="indexterm"/> from the owner of the computer (the initial suspect). By selecting any word by left-clicking on it once and clicking on the green arrow to link it to <span class="strong"><strong>Sarah</strong></span>, as shown in the screenshot, relationships can be uncovered that are not always clear during the first inspection of the data:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04931_06_32.jpg" alt="The Lead Analysis tool"/><div class="caption"><p>ILookIX Lead Analysis creating relationship links</p></div></div><p>Once <span class="strong"><strong>Lead Objects</strong></span> has commenced, it is possible to begin discovery by right-clicking on a <span class="strong"><strong>Lead Object</strong></span> and using the <code class="literal">Find Links</code> function. If there are any links, they will be displayed in the <span class="strong"><strong>Potential Links</strong></span> list. If no links are located, then it might be necessary to refine the lead object's text or increase the <span class="strong"><strong>Speculative Level</strong></span> from the drop-down box on the Mini Toolbar, as shown in the following screen snippet. In normal use, it is preferable to leave <span class="strong"><strong>Speculative Level</strong></span> set to the <span class="strong"><strong>None</strong></span> setting:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04931_06_33.jpg" alt="The Lead Analysis tool"/><div class="caption"><p>ILookIX Lead Analysis setting the Speculative Level for searching for leads</p></div></div><p>Each of the stated facts becomes one starting lead on the canvas. If the nodes are related, it is easy<a id="id509" class="indexterm"/> to model that relationship by manually linking them together by selecting the first <span class="strong"><strong>Lead Project</strong></span> to link, right-clicking, and selecting <span class="strong"><strong>Add a New Port</strong></span> from the menu. This is then repeated for the second <span class="strong"><strong>Lead Object</strong></span> the practitioner wants to link. By simply clicking on the new port of the selected object that needs to be linked from and dragging it to the port of the <span class="strong"><strong>Lead Object</strong></span> that it should be linked to, a line will appear linking the two together. It is then possible to iterate this process using each start node or discovered node until it is possible to make sense of the total case data. A simple relationship between suspects, locations, and even concepts is illustrated in this sample:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04931_06_34.jpg" alt="The Lead Analysis tool"/><div class="caption"><p>ILookIX Lead Analysis discovering relationships between various entities</p></div></div><p>In more complex cases, this allows the practitioner to locate and analyze relationships more efficaciously than a manual search. It is then possible to review the documents supporting the model to glean further information, as shown by the number of file hits evident in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04931_06_35.jpg" alt="The Lead Analysis tool"/><div class="caption"><p>ILookIX Lead Analysis hits on the relationship were found in the <span class="strong"><strong>File Hits</strong></span> (<code class="literal">448</code>) and <span class="strong"><strong>E-Mail Hits</strong></span> (<code class="literal">20</code>)</p></div></div><p>The following screenshot <a id="id510" class="indexterm"/>shows some of the relationship hits obtained as a result of using <span class="strong"><strong>Lead Analysis</strong></span>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04931_06_36.jpg" alt="The Lead Analysis tool"/><div class="caption"><p>ILookIX Lead Analysis located files discovered from relationships</p></div></div></div><div class="section" title="Analyzing e-mail datasets"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec110"/>Analyzing e-mail datasets</h2></div></div></div><p>Analyzing <a id="id511" class="indexterm"/>and selecting evidence from large e-mail datasets is a common task for the practitioner. ILookIX's embedded application, <span class="strong"><strong>E-mail Linkage Analysis</strong></span>, is an interactive evidence model to help practitioners discover links between the correspondents within e-mail data. The analysis is presented as an easy-to-use link model; the complexity of the modeling is removed to provide the clearest possible method of discovery. The results of analysis are saved at the end of the modeling session for future editing.</p><p>An important concept that must be understood is the homogenous nature of all e-mail types supported in ILookIX. All e-mail client deconstructions become part of the same basic explorer e-mail concept. This removes the differences between clients so that functions such as <span class="strong"><strong>E-mail Linkage Analysis</strong></span> can be used to analyze and explore in a new, much easier-to-use interface. This more easily deciphers complex e-mail relationships. It allows the deconstruction of e-mail during the wizard case load process, or it provides the option of deconstructing the pieces one at a time or in groups. Either way, the Interface provides an object model that encompasses all of the characteristics of an internet e-mail item using the RFC standards that apply to all Internet e-mail send/receive clients.</p><p>If there is a large amount of e-mail to process, this analysis generation may take a few minutes. To make the analysis more readable, it is necessary to only select one or a few e-mail stores to analyze at a time when first using the tool. Once the analysis is displayed, the user will see the e-mail linkage itself. It is then possible to see a line between correspondents, indicating that they have a relationship of some type. Here, in particular, line thickness indicates the frequency of traffic between two correspondents; therefore, thicker flow lines indicate more traffic.</p><p>The <a id="id512" class="indexterm"/>application allows the selection of an e-mail store by clicking on the checkbox next to its name. On the canvas, once the analysis is generated, the user may select any e-mail addressee node by left-clicking on it once. Creating the analysis is really simple, and one of the most immediately valuable resources this provides is group identification, as shown in the following screenshot. ILookIX will initiate a search for that addressee and list all e-mails where the selected addressee was a correspondent. Users may make their own connection lines by clicking on an addressee node point and dragging to another node point. Nodes can be deleted to allow linkage between smaller groups of individuals:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04931_06_37.jpg" alt="Analyzing e-mail datasets"/><div class="caption"><p>The E-mail Linkage tool showing relationships of possible relevance to a case</p></div></div></div><div class="section" title="Detecting scanned images"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec111"/>Detecting scanned images</h2></div></div></div><p>Searching for scanned images<a id="id513" class="indexterm"/> is a process that may assist in document authentication or detecting forged documents.

The service is built in to versions of Windows Vista, 7, 8, and 10 and is turned on by default. ILookIX can recover true copies of overwritten files from shadow volumes, as long as they resided on the volume at the time the snapshot was created. VSS recovery is a method of recovering extant and deleted files from the volume snapshots available on the system. It is a valuable resource for locating previously unavailable data to assist an investigation, as illustrated in the case study at the end of this chapter.</p><p>ILookIX, unlike <a id="id517" class="indexterm"/>any other forensic tool, is capable of reconstructing VSS copies in a readable structure in differential or full recovery modes, including VSS and deleted files and folders. Either option is available in the image-loading window of the tool, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04931_06_40.jpg" alt="Volume Shadow Copy analysis tools"/><div class="caption"><p>The ILookIX Volume Shadow Snapshot tool with differential records selected</p></div></div><p>In the test scenario, shown in the following screenshot, the tool recovered a total of 87,000 files, equaling conventional tool recovery rates. Using ILookIX's <span class="strong"><strong>Xtreme File Recovery</strong></span>, some 337,000 files were recovered. The <span class="strong"><strong>Maximal Full Volume Shadow Snapshot</strong></span> application recovered a total of 778,000 files. Using the differential process, 354,000 files were recovered, which filtered out 17,000 additional files for further analysis, as shown in the following screenshot. This enabled the detection of e-mail messages and attachments and Windows Registry changes that would normally remain hidden or difficult to find:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04931_06_41.jpg" alt="Volume Shadow Copy analysis tools"/><div class="caption"><p>The ILookIX Volume Shadow Snapshot tool showing different search results</p></div></div><p>Differential <a id="id518" class="indexterm"/>XFR-VSS records reports on only those VSS where there is a difference (of even one file) between each record to speed up identification of evidential material. Deleted snapshots were recovered and further deconstructed, resulting in more than a terabyte of compressed data being recovered from the original 30-GB drive—believe it or not!</p></div><div class="section" title="Timelines and other analysis tools"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec113"/>Timelines and other analysis tools</h2></div></div></div><p>Timelines <a id="id519" class="indexterm"/>are often used to reconstruct a chronology of events of given periods. However, they can become too densely populated and extended over lengthy periods, so some thought should be given to producing more reader-friendly charts. For example, the overall reconstruction could be provided as a simple, uncluttered <a id="id520" class="indexterm"/>chart showing the key events and so on. Each of the major event nodes could be shown as a separate chart with some linkage to contiguous events.</p><p>The following diagram shows a fairly simple reconstruction of an actual bank fraud that involved two suspects and some electronic transactions and e-mail messages:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04931_06_42.jpg" alt="Timelines and other analysis tools"/><div class="caption"><p>Timeline of events using Timeline Maker Pro</p></div></div><p>Time <a id="id521" class="indexterm"/>event charts aim to correct these shortcomings, as do flow diagrams that assist in interpreting complicated processes. When confronted with a complicated scheme or a process that is unfamiliar, flow diagrams facilitate the visualizing of the event.</p><p>These models are beyond the scope of this book but are worth incorporating as part of any practitioner's analysis toolkit.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Case study &#x2013; illustrating the recovery of deleted evidence held in volume shadows"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl1sec52"/>Case study – illustrating the recovery of deleted evidence held in volume shadows</h1></div></div></div><p>The case study<a id="id522" class="indexterm"/> involves an emerging business providing specialist technical services to a range of mining exploration companies. The business had lost a number of its technical experts to a rival business and noticed a drop in in its market share. There was a suspicion that departing staff members may have stolen some proprietary knowledge and expertise, which they later shared with the competing business. A forensic examination of the business' server and the computer terminals used by the departed staff members was initiated to determine whether some form of industrial espionage or sabotage had occurred.</p><p>With little <a id="id523" class="indexterm"/>to go on other than the CEO's hunch that there was mischief afoot, the former employees' computer terminals and external storage devices were searched for evidence of possible misconduct. Logically, the employees' e-mails were considered to be a sound starting point, but examination only recovered details of their dissatisfaction and contempt for the business and plans to move to the competitor. The e-mails did, however, provide details of the former employees' contacts at the competing business, from which further leads could be developed.</p><p>What was noticed was the presence of a Dropbox account that had been installed and used on one of the former employees' computers. The application had been used and contained a number of folders synchronized and evidently uploaded to the employee's online account. Most of the files appeared to be of a personal and social nature and not relevant to the investigation. However, there was one large deleted archive (compressed) file some 4 GB in size named <code class="literal">Calibration.rar</code> that appeared to be of a technical nature. This file could not be opened during the preliminary examination and may have required some specialist recovery, provided the file was not too seriously corrupted.</p><p>The CEO was advised of the location of the file and questioned about its significance and the presence of the Dropbox account on the employee's terminal, which seemed appalling security practice. The file appeared to be an essential record of technical calibrations critical to the operation of the business, and it transpired that:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The folder containing the data was insecurely stored on the business server but had been removed at about the same time as it appeared in the employee's terminal</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Poor security on the server allowed all users to access and potentially sabotage and steal any data without hindrance and without recording the event</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Unless the data could be recovered, the business faced serious operational problems that could lead to its closure</li></ul></div><p>It seems likely that the archive folder was removed as a deliberate act of sabotage but also exported to the employee's Dropbox folder for some other purpose. A "deep rinse" of the employee's computer was then completed and ILookIX recovered 12 VSS folders, one relating to an earlier period provided a readable copy of the archive file. The file was not password protected, and examination by the CEO established that it contained the missing data so important to the company's operations intact. The file is highlighted in the following screenshot, where it was recovered from the Dropbox synchronization account:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04931_06_43.jpg" alt="Case study – illustrating the recovery of deleted evidence held in volume shadows"/><div class="caption"><p>Recovered data from a Dropbox folder held in a volume shadow snapshot</p></div></div><p>While <a id="id524" class="indexterm"/>the company was relieved to have its precious data returned to it in a short period of time, the following points were noted regarding the business' inability to protect its vital electronic assets:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The business was not aware that the archive was missing and would not have learned of its disappearance for several weeks if it had not been recovered during the examination</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The server and terminals had no password protection and no sound backup to protect and preserve critical data</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">No security auditing of data access management was in place</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The inadequate physical protection of the premises added to the general vulnerability of the business</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The network administrator was a friend of the CEO and an amateur with poor network security abilities</li></ul></div><p>Evidence of theft and malicious destruction of electronic information and serious personnel misconduct was evident as well as evidence being identified for civil action against the former employee. With little information to base a meaningful search on hampered by the absence of any sound information security management system, it was mostly intuition that led to the discovery of the security breach and recovery of the evidence. Such <a id="id525" class="indexterm"/>favorable outcomes involving the recovery of stolen data and evidence implicating a specific suspect are not always the usual outcome. It is saddening to write that the information security at the business remains inadequate and the business obviously did not learn from its mistakes.</p></div>
<div class="section" title="Summary"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl1sec53"/>Summary</h1></div></div></div><p>This chapter described in more detail the process of locating and selecting evidence in terms of a general process. It also further explained the nature of digital evidence and provided examples of its value in supporting a legal case. Various advanced analysis and recovery tools were demonstrated that show you how technology can speed up and make more efficient the evidence location and selection processes. Some of these tools are not new but have been enhanced, while others are innovative, and seek out evidence normally unavailable to the practitioner.</p><p>The majority of laptop, desktop, and network-based computers use Windows operating systems, which have been covered in varying details in this and previous chapters. <a class="link" href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. Windows and Other Operating Systems as Sources of Evidence">Chapter 7</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Windows and Other Operating Systems as Sources of Evidence</em></span>, will outline Windows Registry and system files and logs, and some additional benefits of VSS recovery will be introduced as a resource for digital evidence recovery and analysis. It will describe in some detail other operating systems that are commonly examined, including Apple and Linux. The chapter will also touch on remote access and malware attacks and the prevalence and challenges of anti-forensics that hamper the recovery and identification of evidence.</p></div></body></html>
