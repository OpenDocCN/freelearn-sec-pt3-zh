    Studio, including only the tools needed to communicate with a device via the command
    line. It includes software libraries, APIs, emulator, reference material, and
    many other tools that not only help to create Android applications but also provide

    files between computer and the device. The latest Android devices use MTP or PTP
    protocols, as there were some issues with the USB mass storage protocol. With
    USB mass storage, the drive makes itself completely available to the computer,
    just as if it were an internal drive. But the problem is that the device that
    is accessing the storage needs exclusive access to it. In other words, when the
    device drive is connected to the computer, it has to be disconnected from the
    Android operating system running on the device in order to work. So any files
    or apps stored on the SD card or USB storage would be unavailable when it was
    connected to the computer. In **Media Transfer Protocol** (**MTP**), the Android
    device doesn't expose its entire storage to Windows. Instead, when you connect
    a device to your computer, the computer queries the device and the device responds
    with a list of files and directories it offers. If the computer has to download
    a file, it sends a request to the file from the device, and the device will send
    the file over the connection. **Picture Transfer Protocol** (**PTP**) is also
    similar to MTP and is commonly used by digital cameras. In this mode, Android
    device will work with digital camera applications that support PTP but not MTP.
    On the latest devices, you can select either MTP or PTP options under Settings

    (`adbd`) in the background and will continuously look for a USB connection. The
    daemon will usually run under a non-privileged shell user account and so doesn't
    provide access to internal application data. But on rooted phones `adbd` will
    run under the root account and hence provides access to all of the data. On the
    workstation (where the Android SDK is installed), `adbd` will run as a background
    process. Also, on the same workstation, a client program will run that can be
    invoked from a shell by issuing the `adb` command that we are going to see in
    the following sections. When the ADB client is started, it first checks whether
    an ADB daemon is already running. If there isn't, it initiates a new process to
    start the ADB daemon. The daemons communicate over their local host on the `5555`
    through `5585` ports. The even port communicates with the device's console, while
    the odd port is for ADB connections. The ADB client program communicates with
    the local `adbd` over the `5037` port.

  zh: 一旦选择USB调试选项，设备将在后台运行ADB守护进程（`adbd`），并持续寻找USB连接。该守护进程通常在非特权shell用户账户下运行，因此无法访问内部应用数据。但在已root的手机上，`adbd`将在根账户下运行，因此可以访问所有数据。在安装了Android
    SDK的工作站上，`adbd`将作为后台进程运行。此外，在同一工作站上，将运行一个客户端程序，可以通过发出`adb`命令来调用该程序，我们将在以下部分看到。当启动ADB客户端时，它首先检查是否已运行ADB守护进程。如果没有，则启动一个新进程来启动ADB守护进程。守护进程通过它们的本地主机在`5555`到`5585`端口上进行通信。偶数端口用于与设备的控制台通信，而奇数端口用于ADB连接。ADB客户端程序通过`5037`端口与本地的`adbd`通信。

    loader, Android ROM, and recovery. *Boot loader* is present in the first partition
    and is the first program that runs when the phone is powered on. The primary job
    of this boot loader is to take care of low-level hardware initialization and to
    boot into other partitions. It usually loads the Android partition, commonly referred
    to as **Android ROM**, by default. Android ROM contains all of the operating system
    files that are necessary to run the device. The *recovery* partition, commonly
    referred to as stock recovery, is the one that is used to delete all user data
    and files, or to perform system updates.'

    with updates, the phone boots into recovery mode to install the latest updates
    that are written directly to the Android ROM partition. Hence, recovery mode is
    the screen that you see when you install any official update on the device.

    As a forensic examiner, it is essential to understand this in detail. This would
    help you to gain knowledge that is required to understand the internals of the
    device and gain expertise on several issues that are encountered during an investigation.
    Rooting Android phones has become a common phenomenon and very often rooted phones
    are encountered during investigations. Also, depending upon the situation and
    data to be extracted, the examiner themself has to root the device in order to
    extract certain data. The following sections cover rooting an Android device and
    other related concepts in detail.

- en: 'To understand rooting, it is essential to understand how Unix-like systems
    work. The original Unix operating system, on which Linux and other Unix-like systems
    are based, was designed from the very beginning as a multiuser system. This is
    primarily because personal computers did not yet exist and hence it was necessary
    to have a mechanism for separating and protecting the resources of the individual
    users while allowing them to use the system simultaneously. But in order to perform
    privileged tasks such as granting and revoking powers for ordinary users and accessing
    critical system files to repair or upgrade the system, it was necessary to have
    a system administrator account that has superuser access. So, we have two types
    of accounts: normal user accounts that have fewer privileges and a superuser or
    **root account** that has all of the privileges.'
  id: totrans-199
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Hence, *root* is the username or account that by default has access to all commands
    and files on a Linux or other Unix-like operating system. It is also referred
    to as the root account, root user, and the superuser. So, in Linux, the root user
    has the power to start/stop any system service, edit/delete any file, change the
    privileges of other users, and so on. We have learned earlier that Android uses
    the Linux kernel and hence most of the concepts present in Linux are applicable
    to Android as well. However, when you buy an Android phone, normally it does not
    let you log in as a root user. Rooting an Android phone is all about gaining this
    root access on the device to perform actions that are not normally allowed on
    the device.
  id: totrans-200

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is also important to understand the difference between *rooting* and *jailbreaking,*
    as both are often wrongly assumed to be the same. Jailbreaking a device running
    an Apple iOS operating system allows you to remove certain restrictions and limitations
    put in place by Apple. For instance, Apple does not allow sideloading unsigned
    applications on the device. So, by jailbreaking, you can install applications
    that are not approved by Apple. In contrast, Android by functionality allows sideloading
    of applications. Jailbreaking a phone involves bypassing several security restrictions
    simultaneously. Hence, gaining root access on the device is only one of the aspects
    of jailbreaking a device.

    that carriers and hardware manufacturers put on Android devices. By rooting an
    Android device you can alter or replace system applications and settings, run
    specialized apps that require administrator-level permissions, or perform operations
    that are otherwise inaccessible to a normal Android user, such as uninstalling
    the default apps (especially the bloatware) that come along with the phone. Rooting
    is also done for extreme customization; for instance, new, customized ROMs could
    be downloaded and installed. However, from a forensic analysis point of view,
    the main reason for rooting is to gain access to those parts of the system that
    are normally not accessible. Most of the public root tools will result in a permanent
    root where the changes persist even after rebooting the device. In the temporary
    root, the changes are lost once the device reboots. Temporary roots should always
    be preferred in forensic cases.

    Android Forensics*, in Linux systems, each user is assigned a unique **User ID**
    (**UID**) and users are segregated so that one user does not access the data of
    another user. Similarly, in Android each application is assigned a UID and is
    run as a separate process. App UIDs are usually assigned in the order that they
    are installed, starting from 10001\. These IDs are stored in the `packages.xml`
    file in `/data/system`. This file, in addition to storing UIDs, stores the Android
    permissions of each program as described in its manifest file. The private data
    of each application is stored in the `/data/data` location and is accessible only
    to that application. Hence, during the course of an investigation, data present
    under this location cannot be accessed. But rooting a phone would allow you to

    boot loader in some cases. While in fastboot, you can modify the filesystem images
    from a computer over a USB connection. Hence, it is one of the ways to install
    the recovery images and to just boot in some cases. Once the phone is booted into
    fastboot, you can flash image files to the internal memory. For example, the previously

    to perform modifications to the device's firmware by implementing restrictions
    at the boot loader level, usually done through cryptographic signature verification.
    Hence, unsigned code cannot be flashed to the device. In other words, in order
    to run any recovery image or your own operating system, the boot loader needs
    to be unlocked first. Unlocking the boot loader could result in serious security
    implications. If the device is lost or stolen, all data on it can be recovered
    by an attacker simply by uploading a custom Android boot image or flashing a custom
    recovery image. After doing so, the attacker has full access to the data contained
    on the device. Because of this reason, a factory data reset is performed on the
    phone when unlocking a locked boot loader so that all of the data is erased. Hence,
    it is important to perform this only when it is absolutely necessary. Some devices
    have ways to unlock them officially. For these devices, the boot loader can be
    unlocked by putting the device into fastboot mode and running the `fastboot oem
    unlock` command. This will unlock the boot loader and do a complete wipe of the
    Android device.

    administration and has privileges to access and modify all of the files in an
    operating system. The process of rooting mainly involves copying the `su` (superuser)
    binary to a location in the current process's path (`/system/xbin/su`) and granting
    it executable permissions with the `chmod` command. Hence, the first step here
    is to unlock the boot loader. As explained in the *Locked and unlocked boot loaders *section,
    depending on the device in question, unlocking a boot loader can be done either
    through fastboot mode or through following a vendor specific boot loader unlock
    procedure.

    on an Android device. The Android SDK installation is necessary to use tools such
    as ADB, which come along with it. Using ADB, an examiner can communicate with
    the device, view folders on the device, pull data, and copy data to the device.
    However, not all folders can be accessed on a normal phone in this manner, since
    the device's security enforcements prevent an examiner from viewing locations
    that contain private data. Hence, rooting a device solves this issue, as it provides
    unlimited access to all the data present on the device. Rooting a device with
    an unlocked boot loader is straightforward, while rooting a device with a locked
    boot loader involves exploiting some security bugs.
