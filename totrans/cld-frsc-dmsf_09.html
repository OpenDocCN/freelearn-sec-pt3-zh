<h3 id="_idParaDest-127" class="calibre6"><a id="_idTextAnchor138" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/>Cloud Productivity Suites</h3>
<p class="calibre3">By this point in the book, you are well acquainted with the core components and log sources that are integral to <strong class="bold">Cloud Service Providers</strong> (<strong class="bold">CSPs</strong>) such as <strong class="bold">Amazon Web Services</strong> (<strong class="bold">AWS</strong>), Azure, and <strong class="bold">Google Cloud Platform</strong> (<strong class="bold">GCP</strong>). As we pivot to productivity suites, it’s crucial to recognize that these platforms—namely Microsoft 365 and Google Workspace—are often the epicenter of organizational data and activity. The investigation of incidents in these environments comes with its own unique challenges and possibilities, as these services offer not just computing and storage but also extensive collaborative tools, all available through a <strong class="bold">Software as a Service</strong> (<strong class="bold">SaaS</strong>) model. The SaaS model, though convenient for organizations, means analysis will be dependent on which log sources are made available for investigators by <span>the products.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">It’s important to note that AWS does not have a cloud productivity suite akin to Microsoft 365 or Google Workspace. While AWS offers a vast array of cloud infrastructure and platform services, it has not ventured deeply into the cloud-based office productivity market. Microsoft and Google, on the other hand, have a longstanding presence in productivity software and have naturally extended their offerings into the cloud. AWS has focused more on backend infrastructure (<strong class="bold">Infrastructure as a Service</strong>, or <strong class="bold">IaaS</strong>) and hasn’t prioritized creating a competing suite in this space. In this chapter, we will delve deeper into the features of Microsoft 365 and Google Workspace, examining their integral components and the kinds of logs and data that are pertinent in a <span>forensic investigation.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">Specifically, we will discuss the following topics in <span>this chapter:</span></p>

<ul class="calibre12">
<li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">Licensing</strong>: Microsoft 365 licensing is crucial in the context of organizational security as different license levels offer varying security capabilities. For example, an E5 license <a id="_idIndexMarker502" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/>offers advanced threat protection features such as <strong class="bold">Threat Intelligence</strong> (<strong class="bold">TI</strong>) and <strong class="bold">Advanced Threat Analytics</strong> (<strong class="bold">ATA</strong>), which are not <a id="_idIndexMarker503" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/>available in lower-tier licenses such as E3 or E1. Licenses are assigned at the user level, meaning that each<a id="_idIndexMarker504" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/> employee can be granted access to different suites of tools and security features depending on their role within the organization. This granular approach allows companies to optimize costs while ensuring that employees have the appropriate level of security measures in place. For instance, an IT administrator might need an E5 license for its robust security features, while a sales representative might only need an E3 license. Choosing the right Microsoft 365 license is therefore not just a matter of functionality but also a vital consideration for implementing a layered <span>security posture.</span>
<p class="calibre3">Security professionals should consider allocating a higher-tier license such as E5 to take advantage of all of Microsoft’s advanced security and <span>eDiscovery tools.</span></p>

<h2 id="_idParaDest-132" class="calibre10"><a id="_idTextAnchor143" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/>Microsoft 365</h2>
<p class="calibre3">Understanding the IAM <a id="_idIndexMarker512" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/>features of <strong class="bold">Azure Active Directory</strong> (<strong class="bold">Azure AD</strong>) is essential for cloud security, particularly within the Microsoft 365 suite. Azure AD allows <a id="_idIndexMarker513" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/>for detailed <strong class="bold">Role-Based Access Control</strong> (<strong class="bold">RBAC</strong>) and <strong class="bold">Multi-Factor Authentication</strong> (<strong class="bold">MFA</strong>). It also supports <strong class="bold">Conditional Access</strong> (<strong class="bold">CA</strong>) policies that<a id="_idIndexMarker514" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/> adapt security based on user location, device state, and risk profile, effectively blocking potentially unsafe access attempts. Furthermore, Azure AD’s auditing, through log entries for various activities such as sign-ins and <a id="_idIndexMarker515" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/>password changes, and integration with tools such as Azure Sentinel for log aggregation, provides critical data for incident responders. This comprehensive approach to access and audit management is a fundamental aspect of maintaining <a id="_idIndexMarker516" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/>security and conducting forensic investigations in cloud environments. Here’s an overview of Microsoft 365’s <span>IAM features:</span></p>

<ul class="calibre12">
<li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">Azure AD</strong>: The heart of Microsoft 365’s IAM is Azure AD, an enterprise-level <strong class="bold">Identity Service Provider</strong> (<strong class="bold">IDSP</strong>). Azure AD allows for complex RBAC to Microsoft’s suite of services and any<a id="_idIndexMarker517" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/> integrated third-party or internal apps. Security professionals can create custom roles, define access permissions at granular levels, and <span>enforce MFA.</span></li>
<li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">CA policies</strong>: Azure AD also supports CA policies that can enforce security protocols based on the user’s location, device state, and risk profile. For example, a policy can be set to block access from logins outside of the organization’s <span>internal network.</span></li>
<li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">Audit logs and alerts</strong>: Incident responders can benefit from Azure AD’s robust auditing capabilities. Log entries are generated for a wide variety of events such as user sign-ins, password resets, and privilege escalations. Azure Sentinel can be used to aggregate<a id="_idIndexMarker518" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/> logs from Azure AD and other sources for more comprehensive <strong class="bold">Threat Detection and Response</strong> (<strong class="bold">TDR</strong>). Login activity will also be captured in Microsoft Unified Audit logs, discussed later in <span>this chapter.</span></li>

<ul class="calibre12">
<li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">Google Identity Platform</strong>: Google Workspace’s IAM centers on Google’s Identity Platform, which includes basic identity services such as SSO and MFA. While not as extensive as Azure AD, Google Identity still offers essential features for <span>securing access.</span></li>
<li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">Context-Aware Access</strong>: As with Microsoft’s CA, Google Workspace provides Context-Aware Access features. These can enforce access policies based on factors such as the user’s device and location, allowing security professionals to create granular, <span>situation-based rules.</span></li>
<li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">Work Insights and Alert Center</strong>: Google Workspace has the Work Insights tool and an Alert Center API, which provide monitoring and alerting services. Work Insights can be configured to track various metrics that can be useful for spotting abnormal patterns indicative of a security incident. The Alert Center API provides real-time alerts<a id="_idIndexMarker521" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/> for suspicious activity, and it can be integrated with <strong class="bold">Security Information and Event Management</strong> (<strong class="bold">SIEM</strong>) solutions for <span>centralized monitoring.</span></li>
<li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">OAuth apps whitelisting</strong>: Google Workspace allows admins to whitelist or block OAuth 2.0-based apps, preventing unauthorized data access. This is particularly useful for mitigating risks associated with third-party apps that request broad permissions but are <span>not vetted.</span></li>

<li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">DLP</strong>: Similar to Microsoft 365, Google Workspace also has a DLP feature that can be configured to detect sensitive data and either warn the user or block <span>transactions entirely.</span></li>
<li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">Audit logs</strong>: Google Workspace provides detailed logs for various services such as Gmail, Drive, and mobile devices. These logs can be exported to BigQuery or third-party SIEM systems for advanced analysis and reporting, enabling a quicker response to incidents. These logs are accessible through the Google Admin console under the <span><strong class="bold">Reporting</strong></span><span> section.</span></li>

<p class="calibre3">Both Microsoft 365 and Google Workspace offer a range of features aimed at auditing, compliance, and security. Microsoft 365 generally offers more advanced and granular controls via its Microsoft <a id="_idIndexMarker534" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/>Purview, particularly useful for larger enterprises with complex needs. Google Workspace, on the other hand, offers a simpler but still robust set of features via its Admin console. For security professionals and incident responders, understanding the capabilities of these platforms is essential for effective <strong class="bold">Incident Management</strong> (<strong class="bold">IM</strong>), auditing, and <span>ensuring compliance.</span></p>

<p class="calibre3">You have gained an understanding of core services and IAM features, as well as the auditing and compliance capabilities within Microsoft 365 and Google Workspace. These aren’t just your run-of-the-mill cloud services; they are the backbone of organizational data and activity, featuring extensive collaborative tools under a SaaS model. The SaaS architecture amplifies the complexity of conducting investigations, given that you are reliant on log sources provided by <span>these platforms.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">You’ve learned the importance of features such as Microsoft’s Unified Audit logs and Google Workspace’s Alert Center API, which are indispensable tools for incident responders. We delved into IAM, discussing how Azure AD and Google Identity Platform can be leveraged for more secure and monitored environments. Finally, we touched upon the security and compliance features in both suites, equipping you with the knowledge to ensure your organization remains compliant with various <span>legal frameworks.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">In the next chapter, we will pivot our focus toward the DFIR process in cloud environments. While this chapter equipped you with an understanding of the two most common productivity suites, the next chapter will deepen your insight into critical aspects of the DFIR process. We’ll jump into how the DFIR process is applied in cloud infrastructures, providing you with the knowledge to effectively manage, analyze, and respond to security incidents for organizations with a larger <span>cloud presence.</span></p>
