These PDAs were equipped with an ARM processor, a touch screen, and handwriting recognition and were based on an operating system called Newton OS. The project was closed in 1997 when Steve Jobs returned to the helm of Apple.</p><p>The real revolution and the starting point for the current success of iPhone and iPad has been the creation of the iPod devices and the iTunes software. These devices have completely changed the way each of us enjoys listening to music or multimedia content. Released in 2001, they were produced in different shapes, size, and capacity, from the first model presented on October 23, 2001 based on an ARM processor and 5 GB of capacity (Steve Jobs described it as, <span class="emphasis"><em>a product that put, 1000 songs in your pocket</em></span>). The traditional iPods (iPod Classic, iPod Mini, iPod Nano, and iPod Shuffle) have already been the subject of previous publications in relation to the forensics acquisition and analysis of their content. We limit ourselves here to recalling that, from the point of view of the acquisition, an iPod can be treated as an external hard drive and acquired with traditional techniques of disk imaging. Regarding the filesystem it uses, it is either HFS+ or FAT32, depending on if it has been connected for the first time to a Mac or a PC. The audio files are stored in a hidden folder (typically in <code class="literal">\iPod_Control\Music\</code>) and organized inside a database. Other information that can be found within this type of device are contacts, calendar, and any other file in digital format that the user has decided to copy on the device, in a totally analogous way to an external device (pen drive, hard disk, and so on.). Using traditional techniques, it is possible to perform file carving, to recover deleted files and to create a timeline of the device usage.</p><p>Apple entered mobile communication systems in 2005, through a joint venture with Motorola and the production of the phone Rokr, the world's first integrated cellphone with iTunes. The device was not a great success, to the point that the project was shut down after only one year of life. However, this device has laid the foundations for the emergence of the iPhone.</p><p>The purpose of this chapter is to introduce the basic aspects of the forensic analysis of an iOS device. In the first part, the different types and models of the Apple devices are discussed, with an indication of the methodologies and techniques to accurately identify the model that you have to acquire. The second part analyzes the fundamental principles of the operating system (types, versions, and so on) and the type and structure of the filesystem used on these devices. In particular, this chapter will focus on the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Types of iOS devices</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">iOS device connectors</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">iOS operating system</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">iDevice identification</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">iOS filesystem</li></ul></div><div class="section" title="Types of iOS device"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl1sec15"/>Types of iOS device</h1></div></div></div><p>According to the commonly used definition, an iOS device is a device that uses the iOS operating system. Currently, we have four types of devices: iPhone, iPad, iPad mini, and iPod touch. Furthermore, Apple TV use Apple TV Software and tvOS and Apple Watch uses watchOS: both operating systems are based on iOS, therefore they are a sort of hybrid iOS device.</p><div class="section" title="iPhone versions"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec5"/>iPhone versions</h2></div></div></div><p>The most famous iDevice is certainly the iPhone, which has caused a complete revolution in the concept of cellphones, being based on a multi-touch screen, a virtual keyboard, and few physical buttons (the Home, Volume, Power on/off, and Ringer/Vibration buttons).</p><div class="section" title="iPhone (first model)"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl3sec4"/>iPhone (first model)</h3></div></div></div><p>The first model of the iPhone, known simply as <span class="strong"><strong>iPhone</strong></span>, was presented by Steve Jobs on January 9, 2007 and sold from June 29 of the same year.</p><p>It is equipped with a S5L8900 ARM processor at 620 MHz (underclocked to 412 MHz), 128 MB of RAM, and it uses a cellular connection type quad band GSM/GPRS/EDGE (850/900/1800/1900 MHz), as well as supporting Wi-Fi connectivity 802.11 b/g and Bluetooth 2.0 + EDR (information on how Bluetooth is implemented is available at <a class="ulink" href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3647">http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3647</a>).</p><p>It is equipped with a 30-pin dock connector (refer to <a class="ulink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dock_connector">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dock_connector</a>).</p><p>The phone is identified by the model number A1203 and the hardware string iPhone1,1.</p><p>It was originally equipped with a 4 GB internal memory, which was subsequently increased in two distinct patterns in 8 GB and 16 GB.</p><p>Regarding the software, it originally used an ancestor of the iOS operating system, known as iPhone OS 1.0. The latest supported version is iPhone OS 3.1.3. Besides the traditional means of communication (internal phone book, calls, SMS, MMS, and so on), it integrates web browsing, e-mail, camera, iTunes, and YouTube. At the time of distribution of the iPhone 2G, the App Store did not exist and this is why Apple made Web Apps available, divided into categories (for example, Calculate, Entertainment, Games, and so on). These applications did not save information in the device and only created a shortcut icon for the application that was executed directly from the Internet. The production of these devices was discontinued in September 2007 (4 GB model) and in June 2008 (8 GB and 16 GB models).</p></div><div class="section" title="iPhone 3G"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl3sec5"/>iPhone 3G</h3></div></div></div><p>The second model produced by Apple, marketed from July 11, 2008, was known as <span class="strong"><strong>iPhone 3G</strong></span>, since it added support for the 3G cellular network. Similar to its predecessor, iPhone 3G was equipped with a S5L8900 ARM processor and 128 MB of RAM. In addition to support for the 3G network (UMTS/HSDPA up to 3.6 Mbit/s at 850, 1900, and 2100 MHz), the main innovation in the hardware was the presence of a GPS chip, which is used for geolocation services. The phone was identified by the model number A1241 (or A1324 for devices sold in China) and the string iPhone1,2. The device has been manufactured with 8 or 16 GB memory. Regarding its software, it originally used iPhone OS 2.0. The latest supported version is iOS 4.2.1. With the basic version of the iPhone 3G, the App Store appeared for the first time: it allowed users to download and install on the device applications from a centralized repository. The production of these devices was discontinued in June 2010.</p></div><div class="section" title="iPhone 3GS"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl3sec6"/>iPhone 3GS</h3></div></div></div><p>The third model produced by Apple, marketed from June 19, 2009, was known as <span class="strong"><strong>iPhone 3GS</strong></span>.

It was developed by Apple specifically for iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch. It was unveiled for the first time in January 2007 and was introduced with the first model of iPhone in June of the same year.</p><p>iOS is an operating system based on the older forefather Mac OS X, a derivative of BSD Unix with a Mach kernel XNU based on Darwin OS. It uses the following four levels of abstraction:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Core OS</strong></span>: This level consists of filesystem, memory management, security, power management, TCP/IP, sockets, and encryption</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Core services</strong></span>: This level consists of networking, SQLite, geolocation, and threads</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Media</strong></span>: This level consists of OpenAL, audio, image, video, and OpenGL</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Cocoa touch</strong></span>: This level consists of core animation, multitasking, and gesture recognizer</li></ul></div><p>The main screen, known as SpringBoard, is divided into the following three parts:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The top bar that displays the telephone signal, any 3G/Wi-Fi/Bluetooth active connections, and the battery status</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The central part containing the icons of the applications in your device</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The bar at the bottom containing the most frequently-used applications, such as the following:<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">iPhone: Phone, Mail, Safari, and Music</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">iPad/iPod touch: Messages, Mail, Safari, and Music</li></ul></div></li></ul></div><p>The home screen appears whenever the user unlocks the device or presses the Home button while in another app.</p><p>The complete list of all the operating system versions produced by Apple is published and frequently updated at <a class="ulink" href="http://theiphonewiki.com/wiki/Firmware">http://theiphonewiki.com/wiki/Firmware</a> and a detailed explanation of all specific versions and subversions is available at <a class="ulink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS_version_history">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS_version_history</a>. Moreover, at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.ipswdownloader.com/">http://www.ipswdownloader.com/</a>, it is possible to download all firmware for all models.</p><p>The following table provides a detailed list of included applications with the specific version where the application was originally introduced.

<div class="section" title="iDevice identification"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl1sec19"/>iDevice identification</h1></div></div></div><p>It is very useful for a forensic investigator to be able to recognize the specific model of an iOS device while conducting a search and seizure or prior to an acquisition activity.</p><p>The recognition phase can be performed in the following four ways:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Identifying the shape of the device and the connector used</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Checking the model number printed on the back of the device</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Connecting the device to a laptop and directly communicating with it</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Directly through the OS by navigating to <span class="strong"><strong>Settings</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>General</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>About</strong></span></li></ul></div><p>The first method can be used by practicing the identification of the unique characteristics of each model. In some cases, it may be a complex assessment and it is therefore advisable to confirm the first evaluation with one of the other three methods.</p><p>The second method requires you to identify, from the back of the device, the model number. As reported in the previous tables, from the model number it is easy to identify the type of device.

It is possible to store two or more files with the same name within the same folder, but with a different case of each individual character (for example, <code class="literal">iOS.jpg</code> and <code class="literal">ios.jpg</code>).</p><div class="section" title="The HFS+ filesystem"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec9"/>The HFS+ filesystem</h2></div></div></div><p>HFS Plus (or HFS+) is the filesystem developed by Apple to replace, from Mac OS 8.1, HFS as the default filesystem for Mac computers. In Apple's official documentation, it is called <span class="strong"><strong>Mac OS Extended</strong></span>.</p><p>HFS+ is an improved version of HFS, which allows the user to support larger files (thanks to block addresses of 32 bits instead of 16 bits) and uses Unicode for the names of filesystem objects (files and folders), thus allowing up to 255 characters for each. Until Mac OS X Tiger, HFS+ only supported Unix filesystem privileges to access the file. The Tiger version introduced support for security checks based on <span class="strong"><strong>Access Control List</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>ACL</strong></span>), typical of Microsoft environments.</p><p>The HFS+ volumes are allocation blocks that may contain one or more sectors (typically 512 bytes in a hard drive). The number of allocation blocks depends on the total size of the volume. The HFS+ filesystem uses 32 bits to address the allocation blocks, thus allowing access to 232 blocks (4,294,967,296).</p><p>A typical HFS+ volume is defined by the following six major data structures that contain the information needed to manage the data volume:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The<code class="literal"> Volume Header</code> file: This file defines the basic structure of the volume, as the size of each allocation block, the number of used and free blocks, and the size and position of the other special files</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The <code class="literal">Allocation</code> file: This file includes a bitmap with the used and unused blocks within a volume</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The<code class="literal"> Catalog</code> file: This file defines the structure of the folders in the filesystem and it is used to identify the location of a specific file or folder</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The<code class="literal"> Extents Overflow</code> file: This file contains pointers to additional extents for files that require more than eight contiguous allocation blocks</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The<code class="literal"> Attributes</code> file: This file contains the customizable attributes of a file</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The <code class="literal">Startup</code> file: This file contains the information required at system boot</li></ul></div><p>The data structure can be represented by the following figure:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/image_02_005.jpg" alt="The HFS+ filesystem"/></div><p>Both the special and user files are stored in <span class="strong"><strong>forks</strong></span> or in a set of allocation blocks. The space is usually allocated in <span class="strong"><strong>clumps</strong></span>, where the size of a clump is a multiple of the size of a block. The contiguous allocation blocks for a given file are grouped into <span class="strong"><strong>extents</strong></span>. Each extent is characterized by a starting allocation block and by the number of blocks, which indicates how many blocks contain data from that specific file.</p><p>In the <code class="literal">boot</code> blocks and <code class="literal">startup</code> files, the first 1,024 bytes of a volume are reserved as boot blocks and may contain information requested during the startup of the system. Alternatively, boot information can be found within the <code class="literal">startup</code> file, which allows you to store a greater amount of information.</p><p>A <code class="literal">volume header</code> file, a 512 byte data structure, contains the volume information including the location of other data structures. It is always located at the beginning of the block 2 or 1,024 bytes after the beginning of the volume. A copy of the <code class="literal">volume header</code> file, called the <span class="strong"><strong>alternate volume header</strong></span>, is 1,024 bytes before the end of the volume. The first 1,024 bytes and the last 512 bytes of the volume are reserved.</p><p>The information contained in a <code class="literal">volume header</code> file is as follows:</p><div class="informaltable"><table border="1"><colgroup><col/><col/><col/></colgroup><tbody><tr><td>

It is a bitmap that contains one bit for each allocation block in the volume. If a bit is 1, the corresponding allocation block is in use. If the bit is 0, the corresponding allocation block is not currently in use and is therefore available to be assigned to a file or folder.</p><p>The <code class="literal">catalog</code> file is used to keep the information on the hierarchy of files and folders on HFS+. A <code class="literal">catalog</code> file is organized as a binary tree (type B-tree) and therefore consists of head node, index nodes, and leaf nodes. The position of the first block of the <code class="literal">catalog</code> file (and thus the <code class="literal">head</code> node of the file) is stored in the <code class="literal">volume header</code> file. The <code class="literal">catalog</code> file contains the metadata of all the files and folders on a volume, including creation, modification and access date, permissions, file identifier, and information about the user that created the file.</p><p>The data structure for each file in the <code class="literal">catalog</code> file is as follows:</p><pre class="programlisting">struct HFSPlusCatalogFile { &#13;
    SInt16              recordType; &#13;
    UInt16              flags; &#13;

    HFSPlusForkData     dataFork; &#13;
    HFSPlusForkData     resourceFork; &#13;
}; &#13;
</pre><p>The two areas of most interest to identify the location of the files are <code class="literal">dataFork</code> and <code class="literal">resourceFork</code> (both of the <code class="literal">HFSPlusForkData</code> type).</p><p>The <code class="literal">dataFork</code> field contains information about the location and size of a file or the current contents of the file, while the <code class="literal">resourceFork</code> field contains the application metadata of the file.</p><p>The <code class="literal">HFSPlusForkData</code> data structure is defined by four fields as follows:</p><pre class="programlisting">struct HFSPlusForkData { &#13;
    UInt64                  logicalSize; &#13;
    UInt32                  clumpSize; &#13;
    UInt32                  totalBlocks; &#13;
    HFSPlusExtentRecord     extents; &#13;
}; &#13;
</pre><p>The <code class="literal">logicalSize</code> field defines the size in bytes of the data, the <code class="literal">totalBlocks</code> field defines the number of blocks allocated, the <code class="literal">extents</code> field stores the first eight extents of a file descriptor (an extent is a contiguous segment of a file). If a file requires a greater number of descriptor extents, these are stored in the <code class="literal">extents overflow</code> file. Each extent that composes a file is described in the <code class="literal">HFSPlusExtentDescriptor</code> data structure and is defined by the two fields as follows:</p><pre class="programlisting">struct HFSPlusExtentDescriptor { &#13;
    UInt32                  startBlock; &#13;
    UInt32                  blockCount; &#13;
}; &#13;
</pre><p>The <code class="literal">startBlock</code> field identifies the first allocation block in an extent while the <code class="literal">blockCount</code> field identifies the length in the number of allocation blocks of an extent. The start offset of a file can then be determined by finding the first extent and multiplying the corresponding <code class="literal">startBlock</code> field to the size of the allocation block, which is defined in the <code class="literal">volume header</code> file. Since the files cannot always be completely stored in contiguous blocks on the disk and may be fragmented, <code class="literal">HFS+ dataFork</code> defines a structure that holds up to eight extents. When a file requires more than eight extents, it uses the <code class="literal">extents overflow</code> file, which combines the file with additional extents.</p><p>For the <code class="literal">extents overflow</code> file, if a file in an HFS+ volume is composed of more than eight extents (or is fragmented over more than eight contiguous positions of the volume), the extents in excess will be stored in the <code class="literal">extents overflow</code> file. The file structure is similar to the <code class="literal">content</code> file (binary tree, B-tree); however, it's greatly simplified by the presence of a single data structure (<code class="literal">HFSPlusExtentKey</code>).</p><p>The <code class="literal">attributes</code> file enables the direct management through the filesystem of additional attributes for a file. The attributes are defined as key/value pairs.</p><p>An interesting concept associated with HFS+ is the filesystem journaling used for a recovery process after a volume was not safely unmounted. This file stores file transactions (<code class="literal">create</code>, <code class="literal">delete</code>, <code class="literal">modify</code>, and so on) and might contain the same metadata stored in the attributes or in the <code class="literal">catalog</code> file. It is activated by default on the iOS devices and can be used to recover deleted content.</p></div><div class="section" title="Device partitions"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec10"/>Device partitions</h2></div></div></div><p>iDevices use a NAND type memory divided into two partitions: the system or firmware partition and the data partition.</p><p>The system partition contains the iOS operating system and all the preinstalled applications and it is identified as <code class="literal">/dev/disk0s1</code> or <code class="literal">/dev/disk0s1s1</code>. This partition is not generally accessible to the user in the write mode and may only be modified by an update of the operating system. Since it cannot contain user-installed applications and data, it is small and its size depends on the specific model.</p><p>The data partition occupies most of the space in the NAND memory and is identified as <code class="literal">/dev/disk0s2</code> or <code class="literal">/dev/disk0s2s2</code>.

The analysis of these files requires a minimum knowledge of the SQL commands for the selection of data; however, there are several free software options that can interpret and easily display the data in a database. An example of cross-platform software is <span class="strong"><strong>SQLite Database Browser</strong></span> (<a class="ulink" href="http://sqlitebrowser.org/">http://sqlitebrowser.org/</a>), which allows us to visualize the structure of the database and to navigate within the data, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/image_02_011.jpg" alt="SQLite databases"/></div><p>In a Windows environment, it is also advisable to use the software <span class="strong"><strong>SQLite Expert</strong></span> (available in both personal and commercial licenses at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.sqliteexpert.com/">http://www.sqliteexpert.com/</a>).</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Summary"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl1sec21"/>Summary</h1></div></div></div><p>This chapter illustrated the features of interest for iOS devices during mobile forensic activities. In particular, it introduced the different models with guidance on recognition techniques based on the model number or hardware model number. It also contained an introduction to the iOS operating system with particular reference to the filesystem (HFSX), the partitions (system and data), and the main data structures (<code class="literal">property list</code> files and SQLite databases). These topics are the basics for forensic activity on an iDevice and will be useful inorder to understand the content of the next chapter, where you will learn various tools and techniques that you can use when dealing with acquisition and analysis.</p></div>
