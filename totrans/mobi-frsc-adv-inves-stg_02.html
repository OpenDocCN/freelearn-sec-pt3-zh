    <p>With a wide range of mobile devices around, multiple acquisition methods exist. There is no single universal acquisition method available to all models. Some acquisition methods depend on the phone's lock and encryption status, OS version, type of available storage, and so on. You'll have to work your way through the investigation to discover what acquisition methods are available for a particular device.</p>

    <p>The following is a quick overview of the acquisition methods available for the different mobile platforms listed from the easiest to the most advanced (and labor-intensive). For more details about each acquisition method, please refer to chapters on individual platforms.</p>

    <p>This chapter discusses existing acquisition methods and their applicability on major mobile platforms:</p>

      <p>Many mobile devices come with the ability to back up their contents into the cloud. Depending on the platform, cloud backups may contain as much as the full content of the device complete with the call histories and messages (Apple iOS 7.x through 9.x, Windows RT, and Windows 8/8.1/10); as little as a list of installed applications and a few random settings (Android 4.4 and Android 5.x); or something in between (Windows Phone 8 and Android 6.0).</p>

      <p>For some devices, cloud forensics may be the only acquisition method available due to full-disk encryption and hardware lock. For example, cloud forensics is the only viable process for locked 64-bit iPhones running iOS 8+ and some Windows Phone 8 and Windows 10 Mobile devices.</p>

      <p>Compared to other acquisition methods in general, cloud backups tend to contain the least amount of information.</p>

      <p>For cloud acquisition to work, the expert will have to possess the user's authentication credentials. While a login and password are the most commonly used credentials, two-factor authentication may become an obstacle if there is no access to the secondary authentication factor.</p>

      <p>Cloud acquisition benefits are as follows:</p>

        <p>In the case of Apple iCloud, binary authentication tokens created by software on the user's computer (via Apple iCloud for Windows or its macOS counterpart) can be used in place of the login and password. The use of binary authentication tokens currently bypasses Apple's two-factor authentication. However, these authentication tokens may have limited lifespan (Apple tweaks token expirations all the time), and may have already expired when it comes to the actual acquisition.

        <p>Windows Phone 8 and Windows 10 Mobile have a comprehensive cloud backup system. Cloud backups can be downloaded with forensic tools if the user's Microsoft account login and password are known. Windows 8, 8.1, 10, and Windows RT automatically back up user data, Modern UI apps, and their data into the user's Microsoft account (OneDrive), but only if the user logs in with their Microsoft account credentials as opposed to using a local Windows account.</p>

        <p>A very limited amount of information from Android devices can be backed up into the user's Google Account. However, Google collects and stores a large quantity of information about its users. The data originates from all devices, Android or not, on which a particular Google service was used. As a result, large amounts of highly valuable information can be obtained from the suspect's Google Account.</p>

        <p>Law enforcement may have an option of requesting the full content of a suspect's cloud accounts from the service provider (Apple, Microsoft, or Google) with a court order. Since cloud backups are generally not encrypted (or encryption keys are stored alongside the backup), there are no technical obstacles to obtaining the data. This may very well change in the near future, if these organizations were to implement encrypted cloud backups.</p>

    <p>Many devices (Apple iOS, BlackBerry, and a limited number of Android models, for example, Sony Xperia) are able to produce offline backups via the software installed on the user's computer. Apple iTunes, BlackBerry Link, Sony PC Companion, and many other tools can be used to produce and restore phone or tablet backups. Depending on the OS, an offline backup may or may not be password-protected. Depending on the protection status, experts may be able to extract all, some, or none of the information.</p>

    <p>Offline backups, if available for a particular platform, tend to have as much or more information available compared to cloud backups.</p>

      <p>Password-protected iTunes backups (Apple iOS) are encrypted; the expert will have to supply the correct password in order to decrypt the backup. If the password is not known, the expert can perform an attack (brute-force, dictionary, or combination) in order to recover the password. When analyzing password-protected Apple backups, experts can access items from the Apple keychain. Offline backups created without a password will be unencrypted for the most part; however, the keychain will be encrypted with a hardware key, meaning that no keychain data will be available. Making the (unlocked) iOS device produce an offline backup is a viable acquisition method. If possible, try to ensure that a backup with a known password is created (if backup password is not set, creating one before making the backup will ensure that the keychain items can be decrypted).</p>

      <p>Backup passwords, if enabled, are more of a property of the actual iOS device rather than the backup itself. If backup password protection is enabled, the backup is encrypted on the iOS device before any data leaves the device. Once backup encryption is enabled, no unencrypted data leaves the device regardless of the tool used to make the backup. In other words, Apple iTunes is not actually creating backups; instead, the tool receives an encrypted data stream and saves it to a file.</p>

      <p>Backups produced by BlackBerry Link (BB 10 OS) do not have a password. Instead, they are securely encrypted on-device with a strong encryption key that is stored online. Retrieving the encryption key is possible if the user's BlackBerry ID and password are known, or by serving a government request.</p>

      <p>Similar to Apple iOS, BlackBerry 10 devices encrypt their backups internally. No unencrypted data leaves the device. So, when the user creates a backup via BlackBerry Link or a different tool (for example, Sachesi or Darcy's BlackBerry Tools), the backup tool just passes a command to the BlackBerry device. The device handles the encryption internally and streams the encrypted data flow to BlackBerry Link (or an alternative tool). It is important to note that unencrypted data never leaves the device regardless of what tool is used.</p>

      <p>Stock Android does not come with iTunes-like tools for making full-device backups. However, some <span class="strong"><strong>original equipment manufacturers</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>OEMs</strong></span>) provide tools for making and restoring offline backups (for example, Sony PC Companion for Xperia devices).</p>

      <p>The platform offers a limited capability for creating offline backups via the command line (<code class="literal">adb backup</code>). However, ADB backups may include a limited amount of data compared to iTunes backups. Due to Android fragmentation, manufacturers have control over what does and does not become part of the backup. As a result, some devices may back up call history, contacts, and text messages, while some other devices won't. As an example, Samsung, Sony, and HTC often omit call history, contacts, and text messages, while allowing Google Chrome data to be backed up (which, for example, will contain cached passwords and browsing history).

      <p>Rooted Android phones with custom recoveries (CWM and TWRP) offer the ability to create so-called Nandroid backups, which contain full images of the device's filesystem. During acquisition, such devices can be booted into the Recovery Mode and instructed to produce a full Nandroid backup.</p>

      <p>In general, the phone must have a custom recovery installed in order to produce a Nandroid backup. Installing a custom recovery (if it's not yet installed) requires an unlocked bootloader (or a bootloader hack) and/or rooting the device. Note that, in most cases, unlocking a locked bootloader will wipe all user data on the device. This Android security measure can be bypassed in certain cases via the bootloader hack.</p>

      <p>Note that neither cloud nor offline backups include unallocated space.</p>

    <p>Physical acquisition strikes the best balance between extraction speed, ease of use, and the amount of information being extracted. This process does not require disassembling the phone or using any special hardware. A micro USB (or Apple Lightning) cord, a PC (or Mac), and forensic software for physical acquisition (refer to the following section) are all that's required. For iOS devices newer than iPhone 4, Elcomsoft iOS Forensic Toolkit is currently the only physical acquisition solution available.</p>

    <p>Physical acquisition extracts the maximum amount of information from the device. For unencrypted devices, unallocated space will be extracted together with the filesystem, allowing experts to carve the dump for destroyed evidence. Encrypted devices handle unallocated space differently. For example, Apple iOS always uses full-disk encryption that does not keep encryption keys to released data blocks. As a result, unallocated areas can be accessed, but cannot be decrypted in Apple devices even if the device is jailbroken and the passcode is known.</p>

      <p>When it comes to Apple devices, physical acquisition is fully available for 32-bit hardware, with limited support for 64-bit devices (keychain items remain encrypted when acquiring a 64-bit device, even if the passcode is known). The 32-bit acquisition process supports iPhone 4, 4S, 5, and 5C, but not the later 5S, 6, or 6 Plus. The original iPad mini can be acquired with the 32-bit process, but iPad mini 2 (Retina) already uses a 64-bit <span class="strong"><strong>System on a Chip</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>SoC</strong></span>), so physical acquisition is available via a separate (64-bit) process.</p>

      <div class="note" title="Note" style="">

        <div class="inner">

          <h3 class="title" id="toc_2"><a id="note6"/>Note</h3>

          <p>SoC is an integrated circuit that combines electronics such as the main CPU, GPU, wireless modems, and dedicated motion and other co-processors on a single chip. A SoC packs much more than just a CPU on a single silicon chip.</p>

        </div>

      </div>

      <p>Note that iPhone 4S, 5, and 5C can only be acquired via a jailbreak, so prerequisites for the physical acquisition of these devices includes either a jailbroken iPhone or a known passcode and a version of iOS that can be jailbroken. A non-jailbroken iPhone 4S, 5, or 5C locked with an unknown passcode cannot be extracted via physical acquisition; however, a limited amount of data can still be extracted even if the device is locked with an unknown passcode.</p>

      <p>The 64-bit acquisition process supports all existing Apple devices, such as iPhone 5S/6/6S/Plus, iPad mini 2-4, iPad Air/Air 2, and iPad Pro. The 64-bit process is backward-compatible with 32-bit devices and can be used instead of the full 32-bit acquisition process if there is an error acquiring the device. However, the 64-bit process is highly invasive; it modifies the content of user and system partitions. Instead of a DMG image, the 64-bit process returns a TAR file of the filesystem (files and folders only). Finally, keychain items are acquired, but cannot be decrypted via the 64-bit process even if the passcode is known.</p>

      <p>Physical acquisition is probably the best extraction method available for Android devices. Physical acquisition operates on a higher level than JTAG or chip-off.</p>

      <div class="note" title="Note" style="">

        <div class="inner">

          <h3 class="title" id="toc_4"><a id="note7"/>Note</h3>

          <p>JTAG: This is a common name for <span class="strong"><strong>test access ports</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>TAP</strong></span>) standardized by the <span class="strong"><strong>Joint Test Action Group</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>JTAG</strong></span>) association. These ports, among other things, can be utilized to access raw data stored in the connected device. Chip-off: This is an advanced, destructive acquisition technique where individual storage chips (for example, <span class="strong"><strong>embedded MultiMediaCard</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>eMMC</strong></span>)) are removed from the device and imaged directly (by attaching wire leads to the chip contacts) or via a commercially-available adapter.</p>

        </div>

      </div>

      <p>Since physical acquisition runs through the phone's controller, in many cases, dumping an encrypted device will produce a decrypted dump (which is not the case for JTAG or chip-off). In Android, the dumping process requires superuser permission to run. A rooted device is required. Commercial acquisition tools such as Oxygen Forensic Suite will automatically attempt to root the device (tethered rooting) on the expert's behalf. A different, more advanced acquisition strategy is available for certain devices via a bootloader hack (Cellebrite UFED), which does not require rooting the device or altering its content in any way. Only supported devices can be extracted with this method, which include some Motorola Android devices and selected Samsung, Qualcomm, and LG devices. While this method is mostly applicable to devices with unlocked bootloaders, Cellebrite has bootloader hacks for certain devices with locked bootloaders (for example, selected Nokia Lumia devices).</p>

      <p>Finally, some manufacturers implement service access to the phone's storage via a special firmware update mode. These manufacturers include Qualcomm (Qualcomm HS-USB 9006 / Qualcomm MMC Storage; this works regardless of the bootloader lock status, but may not be available on all devices); LG, regardless of the chipset (LAF mode works regardless of the bootloader lock status); and MediaTek and Spreadtrum (only works on unlocked bootloaders). These modes can be utilized for forensically sound acquisition of some devices via mobile forensic tools, such as Oxygen Forensic Suite.</p>

      <p>For a long time, the Windows Phone OS remained secure against physical acquisition attacks. A bootloader-level exploit was developed for select Windows Phone devices by Cellebrite. Supported Windows Phone 8 devices can be dumped with Cellebrite UFED via a USB cord (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.cellebrite.com/Pages/windows-phone-forensics-physical-extraction-and-decoding-from-windows-phone-devices">http://www.cellebrite.com/Pages/windows-phone-forensics-physical-extraction-and-decoding-from-windows-phone-devices</a>).</p>

      <p>The bootloader exploit works even if the device was updated to run Windows 10 Mobile.</p>

    <p>JTAG forensics is an advanced acquisition procedure that uses test access ports standardized by the JTAG association. These ports, among other things, can be utilized to access raw data stored in the connected device. The acquisition process involves using existing solder points on the device's circuit board. By using specialized equipment and a matching device-specific JTAG cable, one can retrieve the flash memory contents (less the eMMC overprovisioned area, but including addressable unallocated space) from compatible devices. Notably, JTAG acquisition is often available even for locked, damaged, or otherwise inaccessible devices. JTAG acquisition is available for many Android devices, as well as some feature phones and Windows Phone 7 and 8 devices. JTAG is not available for recent BlackBerry 10 devices. It is not available for any Apple device either.</p>

    <p>JTAG operates on a lower level compared to physical acquisition. This has its advantages and disadvantanges.</p>

    <p>The following are the JTAG benefits:</p>

    <p>Major drawbacks of JTAG acquisition include the following:</p>

      </ul>

    </div>

    <p>JTAG forensics is a labor-intensive and time-consuming process requiring an expert to use a well-equipped lab. As such, forensic experts tend to try JTAG acquisition after other methods prove unsuccessful.</p>

    <p>Chip-off acquisition is a highly advanced, destructive extraction technique that requires attaching wire leads to the PCB contacts or physically removing (desoldering) the phone's flash memory chip. Chip-off is considered more difficult compared to JTAG; however, the amount of information acquired via chip-off acquisition is similar to the amount of data acquired by JTAGging the device. Since most smartphones use standard eMMC flash modules, the process is standardized and typically presents no surprises to the examiner.</p>

    <p>When imaging computer hard drives, one normally attempts to go as low level as possible. In the world of mobile forensic, the lowest-level access is not always the best. While reading the chips directly produces a complete raw dump of the memory chips, the investigator may be faced with an encrypted partition with no decryption keys stored anywhere around. In the case of Apple devices, many Samsung phones, and other devices (for example, the Android 5 Nexus line), encryption is enforced out-of-the-box. This forced encryption cannot be bypassed during low-level acquisition or by attacking the offline image even if you know the correct passcode. Ð¡hip-off acquisition delivers the best result when used on unencrypted devices.</p>

    <p>Chip-off benefits include the following:</p>

    <div class="itemizedlist">

    <p>Chip-off acquisition is useless on Apple iOS devices as these devices enforce encryption out-of-the-box. It's also useless on encrypted BlackBerry 10 devices; however, BlackBerry 10 does not enforce encryption and does not enable it out-of-the-box, so the encryption status of BB10 smartphones should be confirmed on a case-by-case basis.</p>

    <p> <span class="strong"><strong>In-system programming</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>ISP</strong></span>) forensics is a non-destructive variation of chip-off acquisition. ISP is an advanced acquisition process that is in between JTAG and chip-off. During the acquisition process, examiners can attempt to dump the content of the eMMC memory without removing the chip. ISP acquisition is only available for devices utilizing eMMC or eMCP-style <span class="strong"><strong>ball grid array</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>BGA</strong></span>) chips. Access to the memory is obtained through access points around the BGA chip. This acquisition process is considered non-destructive in that, if all stars align, the device can be reassembled and booted after the extraction.</p>

    <p>eMMC ISP is used to create a binary image of the device, which can be acquired and analyzed with one of the many commercially-available forensic tools, such as UFED or Oxygen Forensic Suite.</p>

    <p>ISP benefits include the following:</p>

        <li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Cannot overcome encryption (experts may or may not be able to decrypt extracted images)</li>

    </div>

    <p>Limitations of the ISP acquisition process are similar to those of chip-off. Encrypted devices are better left to other acquisition techniques, meaning that no Apple smartphone or tablet can be acquired via ISP. Technically, the technique can be used on an Apple iOS device; however, decrypting the data partition will not be possible.</p>
