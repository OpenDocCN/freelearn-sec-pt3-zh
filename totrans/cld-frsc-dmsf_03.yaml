    with their data being hosted off-premises by a third-party cloud service provider.
    As a result, there is also a direct implication for the availability of forensic
    artifacts, what artifacts can be acquired or accessed outside of a particular
    country, and so on. Jurisdiction plays a key role in cloud forensics. This chapter
    aims to uncover the legal, privacy, and contractual risks that typically arise
    out of cloud usage and its impact on forensic investigations.

- en: A breach counselor (also known as a breach coach) is an attorney with expertise
    in cybersecurity and related legal frameworks. A breach counselor’s responsibility
    is to understand the data hosted by an affected organization and develop an understanding
    of the respective legal implications for the organization because of the cybersecurity
    incident or breach. Typically, breach coaches are retained when there is a risk
    of litigation due to the impact of the security incident or breach (for example,
    unauthorized disclosure of private and sensitive data leading to identity fraud
    against customers) and as a result, breach coaches provide recommendations and
    legal advice to the affected organization as they navigate and respond to the
    incident.
  id: totrans-4

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Breach coaches can also represent the organization in a court of law should
    the matter go to court, but in most cases, an organization retains breach coaches
    to identify the organization’s legal obligations to report the incident in due
    course and to limit the chances of litigation.

- en: For breach coaches to provide legal advice to the affected organization, breach
    coaches work with DFIR teams to identify the nature and cause of the cybersecurity
    incident, the extent of private or sensitive data disclosure, and any additional
    insights in relation to the cyber incident itself. To ensure all the parties in
    a cybersecurity incident (the breach coach, the organization, and the DFIR team)
    can freely communicate with each other about the cyber incident without the risk
    of such communications being disclosed, breach coaches exercise something called
    **solicitor-client privilege** or **litigation privilege**. Solicitor-client privilege
    or attorney-client privilege protects the communication between the organization,
    lawyer, and DFIR team. Where the communication is intended to be privileged and
    confidential, it is protected from disclosure, unless the communication is deemed
    to be factual in nature, in which case the privilege may not be exercised in certain
    jurisdictions.

- en: '**Data protection and privacy**: As of 2023, the majority of organizations
    will have to consider the concerns around securing their data hosted in the cloud.
    Regulations such as, but not limited to, the **General Data Protection Regulation**
    (**GDPR**) in the **European Union** (**EU**) and the **California Consumer Privacy
    Act** (**CCPA**) in the **United States (US)** outline how personal data must

- en: GDPR in the EU sets out specific rules for the protection of personal data,
    which also include instructions that the processing of personal information shall
    be done lawfully, fairly, and transparently within the EU, and that individuals
    have the right to access, rectify, and erase their personal information. This
    means that you cannot transfer any artifacts as part of an investigation outside
    of the EU (GDPR enforcement) zone, and will be required to set up and conduct
    your forensic investigation locally within the EU region. Investigators may also
    be required to work with their EU counterparts instead, to comply with GDPR requirements.
    Even if you can access the artifacts from anywhere in the world, GDPR requires
    that any artifacts that may contain personal information are physically located/stored
    within the EU.

  zh: 欧盟的 GDPR 规定了个人数据保护的具体规则，其中包括指示个人信息的处理必须在欧盟范围内合法、公平且透明，并且个人有权访问、修改和删除其个人信息。这意味着，作为调查的一部分，不能将任何证据转移到欧盟（GDPR
    执行）区域之外，必须在欧盟地区本地设立并进行取证调查。调查员也可能需要与他们的欧盟同行合作，以遵守 GDPR 要求。即便您可以从全球任何地方访问证据，GDPR
    仍要求任何可能包含个人信息的证据必须物理存储在欧盟境内。
- en: CCPA also outlines some of the considerations for incident investigations where
    personal information is involved. It is similar to GDPR in stating that artifacts
    must be collected lawfully, meaning there should be a legal basis on which to
    collect these artifacts (which may contain personal information, health information,
    and so on), and investigate. CCPA also requires investigators to comply with deletion
    requests for personal information that may be collected as part of investigations,
    and investigators are required to apply the necessary security controls to prevent
    the unauthorized access to, or destruction or modification of, artifacts during
    investigations.

    approach and framework for security assessments, access control and authorizations,
    and the continuous monitoring of cloud infrastructure services, to ensure CSPs
    achieve the necessary security compliance prior to offering services to US government
    agencies. Compliance with FedRAMP ensures digital forensic investigators access
    to any necessary logs and artifacts, as FedRAMP outlines requirements for CSPs
    to maintain logs and artifacts, preserve evidence for forensic analysis, and comply
    with the appropriate legal and regulatory mandates. However, it is important to
    note that CSPs do not need to show FedRAMP compliance for all their service offerings

- en: Cloud services/products are typically a subset of specialized and curated cloud
    service offerings that comply with FedRAMP and are specifically designed to cater
    to US government agencies who would like to leverage cloud services. It is therefore
    important for investigators to recognize whether the cloud service or product

  zh: 私人数据的法律框架
- en: In general terms, private data is any data that is personal or sensitive in
    nature and is not intended for public dissemination. Examples include your name,
    date of birth, address, and **Social Security Number** (**SSN**) as these are
    typically classified as **Personally Identifiable Information** (**PII**), meaning
    these datasets can be used to identify someone. **Payment Card Information** (**PCI**)
    is a group of confidential datasets that includes bank account, credit card number,
    card validation number, and the expiration month and year of the card. Finally,
    you have data such as medical records, diagnosis and assessment reports, X-ray
    reports, and psychological assessment reports, which are referred to as **Personal
    Health Information** (**PHI**), which is sensitive in nature.

  zh: 一般来说，私人数据是指任何个人或敏感性质的数据，这些数据不应公开传播。例如，您的姓名、出生日期、地址和**社会保障号码**（**SSN**），这些通常被归类为**个人身份信息**（**PII**），意味着这些数据集可用于识别某个人。**支付卡信息**（**PCI**）是一类机密数据集，包括银行账户、信用卡号码、卡片验证号码以及卡片的到期月份和年份。最后，还有像医疗记录、诊断和评估报告、X光报告以及心理评估报告这样的数据，称为**个人健康信息**（**PHI**），这类数据本质上是敏感的。
- en: The sensitivity of the information also presents a challenge for incident responders
    and digital forensic investigators. Private data is often protected by laws and
    regulations governing data privacy and security (GDPR, CCPA, and so on), and therefore
    companies and incident responders are responsible for acting appropriately to
    safeguard private data and prevent unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. This
    also means that companies must address the necessary contractual obligations to
    ensure private data remains private. From a cloud forensics point of view, it
    is important for a forensic investigator to understand the nuances of various
    datasets that may be hosted in the cloud. Indicated in the next sections are some
    of the legal considerations.

    secrets, financial information, personal information of employees or customers,
    and proprietary information about products or services. The parties to a contract

- en: With the cloud, DIFR has become a little more complicated. As such, it has significant
    implications for the assigning of liabilities and responsibilities for data breaches
    and other security incidents. In cloud computing, there are several different
    parties involved, including the CSPs, the cloud customer, and any third-party
    providers that may be involved. Each of these parties may have different roles
    and therefore different levels of liability and responsibility exposures in the
    event of a security incident.
  id: totrans-139
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: CSPs generally have a higher level of liability and responsibility for security
    incidents because they are responsible for the overall security and availability
    of the cloud infrastructure. This includes maintaining the physical security of
    the data centers, securing the network infrastructure, and implementing security
    controls to protect customer data.
  id: totrans-140
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Cloud customers have the responsibility for security incidents because they
    are responsible for configuring and securing their own applications and data within
    the cloud environment. This includes implementing appropriate access controls,
    encrypting sensitive data, and monitoring their own systems for security incidents.
    It is important for DFIR teams to understand that threat actors will always attempt
    to exploit what is exposed to the internet. So, if a customer web application
    is internet-facing, threat actors will attempt to exploit the vulnerabilities
    in the applications owned and hosted by the customer, rather than the underlying
    cloud infrastructure.

    computing are significant. DFIR investigations may require access to data that
    is stored within the cloud environment, which can be challenging to obtain if
    the data is encrypted or if access controls are not properly configured. CSPs
    may also have their own incident response processes that need to be followed in
    the event of a security incident, which can impact the ability of DFIR teams to
    conduct investigations in a timely and effective manner.
  id: totrans-142
  prefs: []

    differ and can affect DFIR investigations. It is important for organizations to
    understand their own responsibilities and to work closely with CSPs to ensure
    that proper security controls are in place and that incident response processes
    are well defined and understood.

    frameworks and regulations. This can include data privacy laws, data localization
    requirements, and government surveillance laws. For example, GDPR in the EU has

    of organizations to transfer data to CSPs located outside of the EU.

    of cross-border data transfers, especially when conducting DFIR investigations.

    stored in the cloud may be restricted, or additional legal requirements may need
    to be met before data can be accessed.

    legal framework in place and to develop appropriate incident response plans that

    that the privacy and security of data is protected.

    the legal requirements in each of the jurisdictions prior to collecting and analyzing
    the data. Keep in mind, DFIR teams are expected to ensure they clearly obtain
    consent from the organization prior to analyzing any sensitive information, and
    DFIR teams are expected to apply necessary security controls so that only authorized
    and qualified members of the team can analyze sensitive data. Once the analysis

    the root cause of any breaches that contain personal information. Given the various
    laws enforcing strong response and breach notifications, it becomes imperative
    that DFIR teams are well aware of how to investigate breaches, specifically if
    the data is being stored on the cloud.
