    revolutionized the way we do most of our activities. As a result, a mobile device
    is now a huge repository that holds sensitive and personal information about its
    owner. This has, in turn, led to the rise of mobile device forensics, a branch
    of digital forensics that deals with retrieving data from a mobile device. This
    book will help you understand forensic techniques on three main platforms—Android,
    iOS, and Windows. We will go through various methods that can be used to collect
    evidence from different mobile devices.

    per month by 2022, from 8.8 exabytes in 2017, a compound annual growth rate of
    42 percent. Smartphones of today, such as Apple's iPhone and the Samsung Galaxy
    series, are compact forms of computers with high performance, huge storage, and
    enhanced functionality. Mobile phones are the most personal electronic device
    that a user accesses. They are used to perform simple communication tasks, such
    as calling and texting, while still providing support for internet browsing, email,
    taking photos and videos, creating and storing documents, identifying locations

    mobile forensics, and we will be looking into it in the next section. Digital
    evidence is defined as information and data that is stored on, received by, or
    transmitted by an electronic device that is used for investigations. Digital evidence
    encompasses any and all digital data that can be used as evidence in a case.

    investigation of raw data residing in electronic or digital devices. The goal
    of the process is to extract and recover any information from a digital device
    without altering the data present on the device. Over the years, digital forensics
    has grown along with the rapid growth of computers and various other digital devices.
    There are various branches of digital forensics based on the type of digital device
    involved, such as computer forensics, network forensics, and mobile forensics.

- en: Mobile forensics is a branch of digital forensics that deals with the acquisition
    and recovery of evidence from mobile devices. Forensically sound is a term used
    extensively in the digital forensics community to qualify and justify the use
    of a particular forensic technology or methodology. One of the core principles
    that drive sound forensic examination is that the original evidence must not be
    altered in any form. This is extremely difficult with mobile devices. Some forensic
    tools require a communication vector with the mobile device, and thus standard
    write protection will not work during forensic acquisition.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Other forensic acquisition methods may involve detaching a chip or installing
    a custom bootloader on the mobile device prior to extracting data for forensic
    examination. In cases where examination or data acquisition is not possible without
    changing the configuration of the device, the procedure and the changes must be
    carefully tested and documented for later reference. Following proper methodology
    and guidelines is crucial in examining mobile devices as doing so yields the most
    valuable data. As with any evidence gathering, not following the proper procedure
    during the examination can result in loss or damage of evidence or render it inadmissible
    in court.

    *acquisition*, and *examination/analysis*. Forensic examiners face some challenges
    while seizing the mobile device as a source of evidence. At the crime scene, if
    the mobile device is found switched off, you as the examiner should place the
    device in a Faraday bag to prevent changes should the device automatically power
    on. Faraday bags are specifically designed to isolate a phone from a network.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If the phone is found switched on, switching it off has a lot of concerns attached
    to it. If the phone is locked by a PIN or password, or encrypted, you will be
    required to bypass the lock or determine the PIN to access the device. Mobile
    phones are networked devices and can send and receive data through different sources,
    such as telecommunication systems, Wi-Fi access points, and Bluetooth. So, if
    the phone is in a running state, a criminal could securely erase the data stored
    on the phone by executing a remote wipe command. When a phone is switched on,
    it should be placed in a Faraday bag. If possible, prior to placing a mobile device
    in a Faraday bag, you should disconnect it from the network to protect the evidence
    by enabling flight mode and disabling all network connections (Wi-Fi, GPS, hotspots,
    and so on). This will also preserve the battery, which will drain while in a Faraday
    bag, and protect against leaks in the Faraday bag. Once the mobile device is seized
    properly, the examiner may need several forensic tools to acquire and analyze
    the data stored on the phone.

    which will be defined later. Each of these methods affects the amount of analysis
    required, which will be discussed in greater detail in the upcoming chapters.
    Should one method fail, another must be attempted. Multiple attempts and tools
    may be necessary in order to acquire the maximum amount of data from the mobile
    device.

    extracting and analyzing digital evidence. The rapid increase in the number of
    different kinds of mobile phones from different manufacturers makes it difficult
    to develop a single process or tool to examine all types of devices. Mobile phones
    are continuously evolving as existing technologies progress and new technologies
    are introduced. Furthermore, each mobile is designed with a variety of embedded
    operating systems. Hence, special knowledge and skills are required from forensic
    experts to acquire and analyze the devices.

    is the fact that data can be accessed, stored, and synchronized across multiple
    devices. As data is volatile and can be quickly transformed or deleted remotely,
    more effort is required for the preservation of this data. Mobile forensics is
    different from computer forensics and presents unique challenges to forensic examiners.

    layer. You might need to break through these encryption mechanisms to extract
    data from the devices. The FBI versus Apple encryption dispute was a watershed
    moment in this regard, where the security implementation of Apple prevented the

    But this is not practically possible with mobiles, because just switching on a
    device can change the data on that device. Even if a device appears to be in an
    off state, background processes may still run. For example, in most mobiles, the
    alarm clock still works even when the phone is switched off. A sudden transition

    captures ownership information and the type of incident the mobile device was
    involved in, and outlines the kind of data the requester is seeking. Developing
    specific objectives for each examination is the critical part of this phase. It
    serves to clarify your goals. Before the physical seizure process begins, you
    should be familiar with federal, state, and local laws pertaining to an individual's
    rights. If the right procedures are not followed, the investigation may be considered
    illegal in a court of law. The procedure and the legality may vary based on whether
    you are a government agent or a private party. For example, in the US, **fourth
    amendment** rights prevent any searching or seizure by a government agent without
    having a proper search warrant. The search warrant should clearly authorize the
    seizure of the mobile device as well as the kind of data that needs to be collected.
    After a successful seizure, care should be taken to ensure that a chain of custody
    is established not only for the device but also for the data collected.

    handled the evidence, the date/time it was collected or transferred, and the purpose
    of the transfer.

    present on the device. At the same time, any opportunity to help the investigation

    wipe commands. For this reason, isolation of the device from communication sources
    is important prior to the acquisition and examination of the device. Network isolation
    can be done by placing the phone in radio frequency shielding cloth and then putting
    the phone in airplane or flight mode. Airplane mode disables a device's communication
    channels, such as cellular radio, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth. However, if the device
    is screen-locked, then this is not possible. Also, since Wi-Fi is now available
    in airplanes, some devices now have Wi-Fi access enabled in airplane mode.

    which block radio signals to or from the phone. Faraday bags contain materials
    that block external static electrical fields (including radio waves). Thus, Faraday
    bags shield seized mobile devices from external interference to prevent wiping
    and tracking. To work more conveniently with seized devices, Faraday tents and

    is identifying which tools to use, as this is affected by a variety of factors
    such as price, ease of use, applicability, and so on. Mobile forensic software
    is highly expensive, and unlike with computer forensics, you may sometimes have
    to use multiple tools to access data. While selecting a tool, ensure that it has
    built-in features to maintain forensic integrity. Maintaining forensic integrity
    requires a tool that packages collected data in a format that probably cannot
    be easily modified or altered.

    as forensically sound as possible. Physical acquisition is the preferred method
    as it extracts the raw memory data and the device is commonly powered off during
    the acquisition process. On most devices, the smallest number of changes occur
    to the device during physical acquisition. If physical acquisition is not possible
    or fails, an attempt should be made to acquire the filesystem of the mobile device.
    A logical acquisition should always be performed as it may contain only the parsed
    data and provide pointers to examine the raw memory image. These acquisition methods

    enable an examiner to categorize forensic tools based on the examination methodology
    of the tool. As you move from the bottom of the pyramid to the top, the methods
    and tools used for analysis generally become more technical and sophisticated
    and require longer analysis times. There are advantages and disadvantages of different
    techniques used at each layer. The forensic examiner should be aware of these
    issues before he or she applies a particular technique. Evidence can be destroyed
    completely if the given method or tool is not properly utilized. This risk increases

    device and viewing the data on the phone directly through the use of the device's
    keypad or touchscreen. The information discovered is then photographically documented.
    The extraction process is fast and easy to use, and it will work on almost every
    phone. This method is prone to human error, such as missing certain data due to
    unfamiliarity with the interface. At this level, it is not possible to recover
    deleted information and grab all the data.

    Once connected, the computer initiates a command and sends it to the device, which
    is then interpreted by the device's processor. Next, the requested data is received
    from the device's memory and sent back to the forensic workstation. Later, you
    can review the data.

    a device to a forensic workstation and pushing unsigned code or a bootloader into
    the phone and instructing the phone to dump memory from the phone to the computer.
    Since the resulting raw image is in binary format, technical expertise is required
    to analyze it. The process is inexpensive, provides more data to the examiner,
    and allows the recovery of deleted files from the device-unallocated space on
    most devices.

- en: Chip-off refers to the acquisition of data directly from the memory chip present
    in the device. At this level, the chip is physically removed from the device and
    a chip reader or a second phone is used to extract data stored on it. This method
    is more technically challenging, as a wide variety of chip types are used in mobiles.
    The process is expensive and requires hardware-level knowledge as it involves
    the desoldering and heating of the memory chip. Training is required to successfully
    perform a chip-off extraction. Improper procedures may damage the memory chip
    and render all data unsalvageable. When possible, it is recommended that the other
    levels of extraction are attempted prior to chip-off, since this method is destructive
    in nature. Also, the information that comes out of memory is in a raw format and
    has to be parsed, decoded, and interpreted. The chip-off method is preferred in
    situations where it is important to preserve the state of memory exactly as it
    exists on the device. It is also the only option when a device is damaged but
    the memory chip is intact.
  prefs: []

    method. The JTAG method involves connecting to **Test Access Ports** (**TAPs**)
    on a device and forcing the processor to transfer the raw data stored on the memory
    chip. The JTAG method is generally used with devices that are operational but
    inaccessible using standard tools. Both of these techniques also work even when
    the device is screen-locked.

    on the memory chip. The examiner uses an electron microscope and analyzes the
    physical gates on the chip and then translates the gate status to 0s and 1s to
    determine the resulting ASCII characters. The whole process is time-consuming
    and costly, and it requires extensive knowledge and training on memory and the
    filesystem. Due to the extreme technicalities involved in micro read, it is only
    attempted for high-profile cases equivalent to a national security crisis after
    all other levels of extraction techniques have been exhausted. The process is
    rarely performed and is not well documented at this time. Also, there are currently
    no commercial tools available to perform a micro read.

    the physical storage. With direct access to flash memory, information can be acquired
    from the device through physical extraction. Flash memory is non-volatile memory
    and is primarily used in memory cards and USB flash drives as solid-state storage.
    The process creates a bit-for-bit copy of an entire filesystem, similar to the
    approach taken in computer forensic investigations. Physical acquisition is able
    to acquire all of the data present on a device, including the deleted data, and
    access to unallocated space on most devices.

    and directories, that reside on a filesystem. The logical acquisition of mobile
    phones is performed using the device manufacturer's application programming interface
    to synchronize the phone's contents with a computer. Many forensic tools can perform
    a logical acquisition. It is much easier for a forensic tool to organize and present
    data extracted through logical acquisition. However, the forensic analyst must
    understand how the acquisition occurs and whether the mobile was modified in any
    way during the process. Depending on the phone and forensic tools used, all or
    some of the data is acquired. A logical acquisition is easy to perform and only
    recovers the files on a mobile phone and does not recover data contained in unallocated
    space.

    acquisition is the second-best option. Manual extraction should be the last option
    when performing the forensic acquisition of a mobile phone. Both logical and manual
    acquisition can be used to validate findings in the physical data. During manual
    acquisition, the examiner utilizes the user interface to investigate the contents
    of the phone's memory. The device is used normally through keypad or touchscreen
    and menu navigation, and the examiner takes pictures of each screen's contents.
    Manual extraction introduces a greater degree of risk in the form of human error,
    and there is a chance of deleting evidence. Manual acquisition is easy to perform
    and only acquires the data that appears on a mobile phone.

    necessary skills to identify such situations and use alternate tools or software
    to construct the results. In some cases, an individual may purposefully tamper

    rule it inadmissible. It's important to document the entire recovery process,
    including all the changes made during the acquisition and examination. For example,
    if the forensic tool used for the data extraction sliced up the disk image to
    store it, this must be documented. All changes to the mobile device, including
    power cycling and syncing, should be documented in your case notes.

    and conclusions reached as part of an examination. Reporting should include details
    about all the important actions performed by you, the results of the acquisition,
    and any inferences drawn from the results. Most of the forensic tools come with
    built-in reporting features that will autogenerate the reports while providing
    scope for customization at the same time. In general, a report may contain the
    following details:'

    browser history, chat messages, location details, and so on. Hence they are often
    a key factor in several criminal cases, reconstruction of events, corporate and
    legal cases, and more. Mobile device forensics also comes with its own challenges
    and concepts that fall outside the boundaries of traditional digital forensics.
    Extreme care should be taken while handling the device, right from the evidence
    intake phase to the archiving phase. Examiners responsible for mobile devices
    must understand the different acquisition methods and the complexities of handling
    data during analysis. Extracting data from a mobile device is half the battle.
    The operating system, security features, and type of smartphone will determine
    the amount of access you have to the data. It is important to follow sound forensic
    practices and make sure that the evidence is unaltered during the investigation.
