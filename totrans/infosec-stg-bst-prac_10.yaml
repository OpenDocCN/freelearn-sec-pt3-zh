    Integration/Continuous Deployment** (**CI/CD**) methodologies of IT management
    and software development. Let's have a look at what IaC offers.
  prefs: []

- en: Infrastructure as code
  prefs:
  - PREF_H4
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There is a concept called IaC that is a hugely beneficial approach from both
    a security perspective as well as an IT operations perspective. The basic idea
    of IaC is that your estate is moving more and more away from being physical servers
    in a specific location and toward a fully virtualized, distributed cloud environment.
    Therefore, instead of provisioning, managing, scaling, and de-provisioning physical
    hardware or utilizing the traditional, interactive configuration management tools
    that are catered to those types of hardware, your estate and all of the information
    processing facilities within can instead be defined in *machine-readable files*,
    which are *versioned* and updated the same way software code is updated, to be
    referenced by automation software in a hands-off provisioning/scaling/de-provisioning
    process.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This idea is tightly coupled with **DevOps** and **CI/CD** practices, rather
    than the more traditional split between IT operations and software developers.
    The aim of *IaC*, and most *DevOps* and *CI/CD* practices in general, is to increase
    the velocity of improvements and speed up and improve the efficiency of deployments,
    with higher-quality software being deployed, by reducing error-laden manual processes.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Before we touch on IaC tooling and formats, I would like to mention that IaC
    paradigms often involve leveraging containers and orchestration software, such
    as **Docker** and **Kubernetes**, respectively.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Docker** builds *container images* based on the instructions defined inside
    a **Dockerfile**, which is a text file containing all of the commands required
    for building an image for a system (such as an application and its dependencies)
    as what is known as a **container**. Containers are a lightweight alternative
    to VMs, having been decoupled from the underlying infrastructure of the server
    it runs on. With that, one server can be running containers based on thousands
    of different configurations, with different operating systems and software packages
    in each. Further reading on how Docker works can be found here: [https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/).'

    of these *containers* across distributed environments, and aids in the operational
    aspects of deploying, managing, and scaling containers. The baseline configuration
    for the way the orchestration software will behave is usually defined in a **YAML**
    text file, with further changes being made through either a frontend web app interface
    or command-line interface tools. Further reading on Kubernetes can be found here:

    highlight the requirement from an information security perspective to keep on
    top of the way your organization operates. IT changes incredibly fast, and it's
    important to understand the concepts surrounding new tech in order to ensure the
    processes and solutions are appropriately secure. In this example, consideration
    should be made on how to ensure these tools and text files are checked for security
    concerns, as well as version-controlled. These new ways of packaging and deploying
    software are increasingly becoming the way your organization's estate is built,
    and without the proper governance and procedures defined by your organization,
    they could present new opportunities for malicious actors to exploit vulnerabilities.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When it comes to IaC, after creating the Dockerfiles/YAML required for packaging
    and deploying applications in your organization, you will need to ensure the infrastructure
    the software is deployed to is configured correctly. Enter **Continuous Configuration
    Automation** (**CCA**) tooling. CCA utilizes the principles of IaC and references
    IaCdefinition files in order to automate the configuration management aspects
    of IT we previously referenced.

    system administrators the opportunity to simply "declare" the infrastructure that
    is to be deployed inside their code, and automation tooling takes that declaration
    and then references the predefined "approved" blueprints, which can be configured
    to ensure compliance with security and regulatory requirements, (oftentimes called
    **policy as code**).

    read, we're able to define those same policies into a *machine-readable format*

    infrastructure and deployment scenarios, which are continually monitored for unauthorized
    changes, and any circumvention or noncompliance is torn down while simultaneously
    being replaced with a compliant version. Taking your risks into consideration,
    this is absolutely beautiful. Additionally, we've sorted many *integrity and availability*
    issues out in the process, providing the tooling is reliable and the solution
    is well-architected for your organization.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With *secrets management*, you are able to programmatically create, revoke,
    and rotate your organization's secrets in a dynamic way, responding to changes
    or requirements as set out by policy definitions or detected activity. By doing
    so, you can automate the efficient encryption of data at rest or in transit, with
    zero knowledge of the keys, and audit logs of all interactions. Furthermore, automation
    of the secrets management process can lead to a highly efficient *just-in-time*
    solution for authorization.

    with pre-made container configuration files such as **Docker Hub** have hundreds
    of thousands of projects that have been left to "rot." These files contain out-of-date

    again. Define a reasonable scope to pilot your solution. You don't need to boil
    the ocean on the first day of having your SIEM implemented, and there's definitely
    room to roll out your system gradually, allowing for troubleshooting and testing
    of defined processes. By doing so, you're providing a proof of concept, reducing
    the likelihood of edge cases, while also demonstrating the benefits of a SIEM
    system to key decision-makers.
