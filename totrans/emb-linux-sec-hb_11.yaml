    departure from the super technical hands-on exercises. Instead, we’re going to
    exercise our minds by enhancing our data collection efforts. This isn’t user data
    or performance data; it’s possible threat and prevention data – golden nuggets

    other miscellaneous resources that you’ll want to add to your own personal security
    toolkit. Before I drag you through this jungle, I will give up a couple of disclaimers.
    Firstly, just because I am mentioning it, doesn’t mean I endorse it. You’re smart
    and resourceful. You are capable of making your own decisions on how to process
    what you’re about to learn. Secondly, I accept that my language capabilities are
    limited; I know I am missing many foreign and non-English sites. It’s not that
    I am being inconclusive, but it’s virtually impossible once language barriers
    get in the way. Good thing that most international tech sites are by nature often
    in English.

    security community if that’s feasible for you.

    as diamonds in the rough, whereas most websites are generally just *okay*. As
    I feel compelled to also mention, some websites are just places to be avoided
    at all costs. Rarely do we know which falls into that category until it’s too
    late. It’s safe to say that we’ve all at least once clicked on a link and, before
    the page finished loading, said to ourselves, “Oh man, why did I click on that?!”
    Instantaneous regret. My only point here is for you to properly consider and vet
    your own information sources.

    that you and your team should be taking advantage of. These resources range from
    government agency compliance sources, open source resources, and commercially

    saying that you need to use all of them. I’m merely offering you a buffet of consumable
    knowledge that never gets stale. Eat well. Eat often. Sometimes, I recommend that
    you change it up and try different ones to sample.

    location, or status in the marketplace fall under the umbrella of one or multiple
    compliance regulations. Finding out exactly what is required can be tedious, and
    implementing those mandates is even more *fun*.
  prefs: []

    even ease of navigation. Government websites generally can be a test of one’s
    patience. Yet, they are also the pillar of truth when detailed technical security
    requirements and configurations are mandated for compliance. Do expect, however,
    an extreme level of professionalism and technical detail. Ignore these resources
    at your own peril. The following US government resources are, in my humble opinion,
    the key starting points for gathering and maintaining information related to security
    threats that you can apply within your appliance’s build chain.

    is in each release, tracking said contents versus what vulnerabilities exist also
    gives you a carved-in-stone list of what to track from a bug list and security
    vulnerability perspective. These lists are not persistent, as dependencies can
    change with updates as some packages become deprecated. Tracking ends when your
    product ends. Security concerns never end. Hackers and bad actors never sleep.

    issues along with the fixes for all of them. These lists become your starting
    point for what may be an arduous and never-ending investigation effort.

    Does your security team want to track all 7,000 for you? Do they want you to use
    such a high number of packages? This is where people tend to rant and rave about
    minimizing the software footprint (i.e., only installing the bare minimum packages
    to allow the system to work properly). Once you track this for yourself, you’ll
    appreciate the value of the minimal installation.
  prefs: []

    update perspective but it provides fewer avenues for possible attackers to go
    at your solution. So, I say use whatever you like in the initial prototyping phase

    needed. This exercise will bring you closer to your product and assist you further

    So, I highly recommend curating this data so your team can review any interesting
    findings on a regular basis. Knowing a software package has an open CVE attached

    sure that your team would agree.

    updates, which you hopefully signed up for, are the first place to start but not
    the last. Gather data from blogs, newsletters, and government compliance sites,
    as well. Together, you should be able to create a virtual security weather report

    take your manifest and see if any of your packages or hardware is impacted. Although
    it is a complicated process or workflow, you should be able to ultimately create
    your own database from which to report. A spreadsheet may be easier until you
    truly identify all aspects of data and data sources that you chose to collate.
    The CSV format can give you a jumpstart here too. Regardless of the myriad of
    ways to rummage through this data, creating a concise report at the component
    level will give you that desired virtual security weather report that you seek.
    This may have some blind spots because you’re building this from known searchable

    on aspects of Linux that you may not have (and vice versa – you can help them
    too). My point is, never think that your experiences do not matter. They do. Sharing
    your experiences and solutions might just save someone else a truckload of pain.

    it would ever cost you is your time and attention. Even if you attend and choose
    just to stay on the sidelines and observe, I assure you that learning opportunities
    will abound for you. One day, I bet, there will be a discussion, and you (YES,
    YOU!) will be the one with the answer someone has searched for. Perhaps that situation
    can also become a catalyst to where you want to participate more and be involved.
    Organizing, setting up, presenting, and leading a lightning talk on an impromptu
    technology subject – these are all ways you can get in the game. You may just
    find that you love user groups too.

    animal activists, cyclists, and so many more interest groups (more than I can
    think of) can all be found there, and they are looking for you too.'

    in the Linux world for cybersecurity resources and reference materials. As I mentioned
    earlier, please check the book’s GitHub repository often for updates and new information,
    especially newly updated resources in the cheat sheet.

    You should now have a firm grasp on some of the most influential public and private
    resources (beyond your own vendors). Since you already know how to determine what
    comprises your solution as a whole, you are also now empowered on how to search
    for risks in those components. In closing, and most importantly, you now know
    that there’s an extensive Linux and security-focused community ready to assist
    you and welcome you inside. They value your thoughts and feedback. Share and participate.
    It’s truly mutually beneficial.
