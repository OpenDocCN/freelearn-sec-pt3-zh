<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 6.0pt 0cm">This book covers the Go programming language and explains how to apply it in the cybersecurity industry. The topics covered are useful for red and blue teams, as well as for developers who want to write secure code, and for networking and operations engineers who want to secure their networks, hosts, and intellectual property. The source code examples are all fully functional programs. The examples are intended to be practical applications that you will likely want to incorporate into your own toolkit. Moreover, this book serves as a practical cookbook for building your own custom applications. I have also shared other security best practices and tricks that I learned.</p>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 6.0pt 0cm">This book will walk you through examples of code that are useful in a variety of computer security situations. As you work through the book, you will build a cookbook of practical applications and building blocks to use in your own security tools for use in your organization and engagements. It will also cover some tips and trivia regarding the Go programming language and provide many useful reference programs to boost your own Go cookbook.</p>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 6.0pt 0cm">This book will cover several blue team and red team use cases and various other security-related topics. Blue team topics, namely steganography, forensics, packet capturing, honeypots, and cryptography, and red team topics, namely brute forcing, port scanning, bind and reverse shells, SSH clients, and web scraping, will be covered. Each chapter relates to a different security topic and walks through code examples pertaining to that topic. If you follow this book, you will have a cookbook full of useful security tools and building blocks to create your own custom tools all in Go.</p>
<p>This book is not an in-depth tutorial on using the Go language. One chapter is dedicated to explaining Go; however, it only scratches the surface as compared to Alan Donovan and Brian Kernighan's almost 400-page <em>The Go Programming Language</em><strong>.</strong> Fortunately, Go is a very easy language to pick up and has a quick learning curve. Some resources on learning Go are provided, but the reader may need to do some supplemental reading if not familiar with Go.</p>
<p>This book will not explore cutting-edge security techniques or vulnerabilities that are not already well documented. There are no zero-days or grand techniques unveiled. Each chapter is dedicated to a different security topic. Each one of these topics could have a book written about them. There are experts who specialize in each of these fields, so the book does not go in depth on any particular topic. The reader will have a solid foundation to explore any topic deeper when complete. </p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Who this book is for</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 6.0pt 0cm">This book is for programmers who are already familiar with the Go programming language. Some knowledge of Go is needed, but the reader does not need to be a Go expert. The content is aimed at newcomers to Go, but it will not teach you everything about using Go. Those new to Go will get to explore and experiment with various aspects of Go, while applying it toward security practices. We will start with smaller and simpler examples before moving on to examples that make use of more advanced Go language features.</p>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 6.0pt 0cm">The reader is not expected to be an advanced security expert, but at least should have a basic understanding of core security concepts. The goal is to work through security topics as an experienced developer or security expert who is looking to improve their toolset and grow a library of Go reference code. Readers who like to build cookbooks full of useful tools will enjoy working through these chapters. People who want to build custom tools in Go related to security, networking, and other fields will benefit from the examples. Developers, penetration testers, SOC analysts, DevOps engineers, social engineers, and network engineers can all make use of the contents in this book.</p>

<p>There are a number of text conventions used throughout this book.</p>
<p><kbd>CodeInText</kbd>: Indicates code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles. Here is an example: " The <kbd>make()</kbd> function will create a slice of a certain type with a certain length and capacity."</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre>package main<br/><br/>import (<br/>    "fmt"<br/>)<br/><br/>func main() {<br/>   // Basic for loop<br/>   for i := 0; i &lt; 3; i++ {<br/>       fmt.Println("i:", i)<br/>   }<br/><br/>   // For used as a while loop<br/>   n := 5<br/>   for n &lt; 10 {<br/>       fmt.Println(n)<br/>       n++<br/>   }<br/>}</pre>
<p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p>
<pre>package main<br/><br/>import (<br/>    "fmt"<br/>)<br/><br/>func main() {<br/>   // Basic for loop<br/>   for i := 0; i &lt; 3; i++ {<br/>       <strong>fmt.Println("i:", i)</strong><br/>   }<br/><br/>   // For used as a while loop<br/>   n := 5<br/>   for n &lt; 10 {<br/>       fmt.Println(n)<br/>       n++<br/>   }<br/>}</pre>
<p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p>
<pre><strong>sudo apt-get install golang-go </strong><strong><br/></strong></pre>
<p><strong>Bold</strong>: Indicates a new term, an important word, or words that you see onscreen. For example, words in menus or dialog boxes appear in the text like this. Here is an example: " In Windows 10, this can be found by navigating to Control Panel | System |<br/>Advanced System Settings | Environment Variables."</p>
<p>Warnings or important notes appear like this.</p>
<p>Tips and tricks appear like this.</p>
