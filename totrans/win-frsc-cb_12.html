<p class="mce-root">We would all like our cases to be one hundred percent perfect all the time, but unfortunately things do go wrong sometimes. Whether its because of a technical fault with a product you're using, a mistake made by an investigator, a faulty dataset in the first place, or some kind of legislative issue encountered when a case goes to court, it is all too common to come up against obstacles in your investigations.</p>
<p class="mce-root">In this chapter, we highlight some of the most common things that can go wrong with popular forensic suites and how to fix them. We will then take a look at what you can do when processes fail, and when you come up against legislative or jurisdictional challenges.</p>
<p class="mce-root">Finally, we will provide you with a short guide to taking your first steps in digital forensics, and recommend some advanced further reading - if you haven't been put off yet!</p>

<p>Digital forensics is a very complex field. This means that you are likely to face different problems while working on your cases. Problems may be of different natures: you could fail to install a tool because your workstation doesn't have additional third-party software (usually it's included in the package by the developers); you could fail to process the data source properly because it's damaged or the format or file system is unsupported; you could fail to parse some forensic artifacts because their format has been changed and isn't supported by your piece of software yet, and so on.</p>
<p>Thanks to the developers of commercial forensic software, including EnCase, FTK, AXIOM, Evidence Center, Intella, and so on, you can solve almost any problem quickly and easily (most of the time) with the help of their customer support services, which are usually included in your licence. All you need to do is write an email to the support team, or even call them.</p>

<p>Of course, free and open source tools don't have customer support services, but they have developers. Often, you can contact the developer directly and ask your questions, or even share (if possible) the data source problems you have with them. This helps developers to improve their tools and help the community.</p>
<p>Some tools, such as The Sleuth Kit and Autopsy for example, have mailing lists: you can ask your question and the developer or active users will answer it, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>

<p>Since investigative and judicial processes are put together by humans, from time to time they fail; sometimes quite spectacularly. In this section, we will look at a couple of common examples and discuss what to do when situations like these arise.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p class="mce-root">One of the most frequent criticisms levelled at digital forensic investigators comes in the form of a challenge to the soundness of the evidence they are presenting. This includes the common <em>It wasn't me</em> defense, wherein a defendant insists that they were not the one using the device in question; the suggestion that the evidence itself is somehow faulty; either because of a virus or malware having infected a device before it was analysed, or because the process of analysis itself has modified the data in some way.</p>
<p class="mce-root">There are a couple of ways to deal with these concerns, so lets take a look at them one by one.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p class="mce-root">One of the most difficult challenges to deal with in digital forensic investigations is the defense that someone else must have been using a device when a crime or other nefarious activity occurred. It is a favorite among defendants around the world.</p>
<p class="mce-root">It is almost always impossible to definitively prove that a specific individual was the one using a particular device at a given time. However, in most courts of law and certainly in civil cases, all the investigator is required to do is demonstrate that this is the case beyond reasonable doubt. Sure, someone else could have broken into the defendants house, guessed their password, and downloaded some indecent images of children onto their machine when they were out shopping for their elderly mother, but the likelihood of this is rather remote. This is an extreme example, but it does illustrate the point: most of the time, the user who actually owns the device is the person using it.</p>
<p class="mce-root">In cases where this is a little more difficult to prove—for example, when evidence is admitted from a machine which is shared by several people who live in the same household—there are sometimes other ways to prove beyond reasonable doubt that a particular person was the one accessing the device at that time.</p>
<p class="mce-root">Some useful questions to consider in such a case include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Did the users behavior model that of a specific person within the household during the time the activity in question was taking place? For example, which tabs had recently been opened online? Were they checking a particular email account or social profile?</li>
<li>If looking at a text-based document, does the language used correspond to the normal speech and writing patterns of the individual in question? Are they using words they commonly use in their other documents? Are some of the same words misspelled when you compare the document with messages you know they have sent?</li>
<li>Can data from other devices help to establish the presence or absence of other household members at the time the activity took place?</li>
</ul>
<p class="mce-root">So for example, lets say that one member of a household is accused of downloading illegal files from the internet. Person A is your most likely suspect, because it is their account that was logged in when the downloads occurred.</p>
<p class="mce-root">However, you might not have caught the person red-handed, so you will need to look for other data sources in order to demonstrate beyond any reasonable doubt that it was them. Lets say the desktop computer in question is used by several members of the household, and each has their own account. Showing which account logged in would be the first step toward proving who downloaded the files.</p>
<p class="mce-root">At this point, the defendant may say that someone else must have used their account; perhaps they accidentally left it logged in, or perhaps someone guessed or knew the password.</p>
<p class="mce-root">Guessing the password is always a possibility, but another persons writing style is much harder to fake, so this is where you can bring in the other questions that were listed above. Firstly, look at the language used by the person who downloaded the files. Did they run any related searches before the downloads occurred, and if so, do the search terms contain any linguistic markers that may prove useful?</p>
<p class="mce-root">Generally, by this point, you will have demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt that your defendant is guilty. But, for the sake of argument, lets say your defendant is very insistent that they were not using the computer. No matter how much evidence you present to them, they never admit to a word you say, and continue to say <em>It wasn't me</em>.</p>
<p class="mce-root">You may now want to look at evidence gathered from the other people in the household, to see whether data from their devices can establish that none of them downloaded the files.</p>
<p class="mce-root">Luckily, the booming internet of things industry is making such data increasingly easy to collect. Lets say you have managed to seize every device in the house, and you have the datasets in front of you. You look through them in the Timeline views we discussed in <a href="1553dc63-2b62-49f7-ae18-7db64dd6bc0d.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 11</a>, <em>Data Visualization,</em> and you narrow down your investigation to the time when the files were being downloaded.</p>
<p class="mce-root">Now you can discover what each household member was doing at a given time. Lets say that person B in the house does all the cooking, and at the time the messages were sent, the <strong>Amazon Echo</strong> was on the counter in the kitchen, talking through a recipe for beef bourguignon. Data from the smart TV shows that someone was sitting on the sofa watching a movie, and this is backed up by data from person C's smartphone, which was being used idly to Google names of the actors who were appearing on the screen.</p>
<p class="mce-root">Data from person D's Fit Bit places them in the shower at the time the messages were being sent, and person E has been caught on camera live-streaming a makeup tutorial to their followers on YouTube.</p>
<p class="mce-root">This leaves person A as the most likely suspect. But of course, a defendant may still continue to insist it wasn't them.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p class="mce-root">Sometimes, a defendant will move from one defense to another, in a kind of cascading avalanche of desperation. Lets stick with our example above. Having established that it must have been person A at the computer when the files were downloaded, they have now come up with a new defense: it still wasn't them because, although they were using the device, they didn't deliberately download the files. So either the machine must have a virus, or they might have been hacked.</p>
<p class="mce-root">In today's world it can be difficult to establish that a device had no viruses. Alongside the usual challenges with trying to prove a negative, investigators also come up against increasingly intelligent malware which can cover its tracks, overwrite logs, and delete itself from systems with barely a trace.</p>
<p class="mce-root">In most cases, however, you can use a few methods to establish the likelihood that a virus is present on a machine.</p>
<p class="mce-root">Firstly, and most importantly, run a scan. Unless you are working a particularly complex case, most malware will show up in an initial scan, and once you know what it is, you will be able to work out what it can and cannot do. Also, check whether the machine has antivirus software, and if so, whether it is up to date.</p>
<p class="mce-root">Secondly, if your investigation is focused on a specific time frame, as in our current example, look at what else was happening on the machine at that time. If someone was sending messages in one tab while illegal files were being downloaded in another, it is highly unlikely that they did not know about it. Likewise, it is unlikely that a virus would have navigated to a website, downloaded P2P software, given the computer permission to install said software, clicked through all the options, agreed to the terms and conditions, opened the software, and then used it to download images.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p class="mce-root">A much more serious defense is when a person claims that the investigator's process was faulty. They may claim, for example, that the evidence was contaminated; that their case was unfairly handled; that their rights were not upheld; or that crucial data was skipped, among other things.</p>
<p class="mce-root">The most efficient way to troubleshoot against such things happening is to take precautions to make sure you do not come up against them in the first place. Arguably, the most important of these is establishing and maintaining a proper chain of custody.</p>
<p class="mce-root">A chain of custody is essentially the paperwork that shows where the evidence you have collected has been, how long it has been there, and who was responsible for it. So if you are working in a team of investigators, your chain of custody documentation should detail who attended the scene, who viewed the devices at the scene and decided whether to remove them or not, how were they handled when they were removed (for example, were they shut down and unplugged, or were they already switched off when they were found), how they got to the processing area, who was responsible for them during that time, and who was ultimately responsible for analyzing the data.</p>
<p class="mce-root">Other important details to note include any actions that were taken on the device, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>At which point did you take a forensic image of the device?</li>
<li>Did you back up the original device? At what point did you do so, and where was this backup stored?</li>
<li>How was the device transportation handled? For example, was it put in a Faraday bag?</li>
<li>Which tools did you use to examine the device, and how did you determine that they were working correctly?</li>
</ul>
<p>If you can answer all of the questions above, and you have accurately filled in your chain of custody document, your defendant will be hard-pressed to argue a fault in your process.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p class="mce-root">Probably the most difficult challenges to come up against in an investigation are legal and jurisdictional constraints.</p>
<p class="mce-root">Perhaps you have gathered evidence that implicates a specific website, the server of which is in a country which has no reciprocal agreement with your own. Perhaps data is stored on the cloud and its legal jurisdiction is unclear. Perhaps you have compiled a case against a suspect, but they are in another jurisdiction and you have no authority there.</p>
<p class="mce-root">Ultimately, we all have to work within the boundaries of the law. While popular culture may show digital forensic experts illegally hacking into suspects' computers and breaking all sorts of rules to make sure their case reaches a conviction, in the real world this is not a possibility.</p>
<p class="mce-root">If you do come up against a jurisdictional challenge, your best bet is to follow through with the relevant authorities as best you can. In cases involving serious crimes, for example child protection or drug trafficking investigations, there will often be a way to work with international law enforcement agencies to ensure that your case can be solved. This can take time and requires a lot of patience, however the end result is usually worth it.</p>
<p class="mce-root">The main thing to bear in mind when it comes to legal challenges is that, tempting as it may be to cut a few corners when you know someone is committing a crime, this will only damage your investigation. Not only will your own reputation be put on the line, but your potential contamination of evidence may lead to a case being thrown out, thus having the opposite effect to the one you intended.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>During your computer forensic examination with different tools, both commercial and free or open source, you will face so-called <em>false positives</em>, especially if you are planning to use data carving techniques.</p>
<p>So why do we all face them? No, it's not bugs in your forensic software. The thing is, these false positives just match the criteria used by your piece of software to carve data from, for example, unallocated space of the hard drive or its forensic image.</p>
<p>You will most likely face false positives working with tools which support a large number of different apps, for example Magnet AXIOM. But you must understand, it's better to have a number of false positives than one false negative!</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="149" width="395" class="image-border" src="assets/d946275b-670b-4292-b7ce-6999781c0eaa.png"/></div>

<p>As you can see in the preceding figure, it's not difficult to identify such artifacts: they look messy and don't make any sense.</p>
<p>Anyway, you as a computer forensic examiner must analyze all of them thoroughly, because you can find valuable pieces of evidence even among false positives.</p>

<p class="mce-root">If you've read this far and you're not yet a digital forensics practitioner but are thinking about it as a potential career path, congratulations! You're looking at working in a growing industry with a wealth of opportunities and a lot of different areas to pursue.</p>
<p class="mce-root">Your next steps in digital forensics will depend how far along the journey you are right now, and what you'd ultimately like to get into.</p>
<p class="mce-root">Ask yourself the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do I like working on practical solutions with a physically interactive element, such as taking apart pieces of machinery to find out what's wrong with them?</li>
<li>Do I enjoy technical challenges, such as mind games, puzzles, video games, and technology?</li>
<li>Do I prefer to work alone or as part of a team?</li>
<li>Is it more important to me to earn a lot of money, or to work in an area where I feel like I'm making a difference?</li>
<li>Would I rather be involved in actual investigations, or in research and development of tools?</li>
<li>Which areas of digital forensics appeal to me the most?</li>
</ul>
<p class="mce-root">Everyones answers to these questions will be different. No one can choose the right path for you except you; and even then, we all get it wrong sometimes! One of the great things about working in digital forensics, however, is that so many of the skills are transferable. Once you have a skill set that includes technical investigation, research activities, and an ability to remain calm under pressure, you can apply this to all sorts of possible careers.</p>
<p class="mce-root">The three main strands of digital forensics work involve law enforcement, corporate work, and academia. Lets take a brief look at each of these to see which might suit you best.</p>

<p class="mce-root">Academic research is a highly demanding career path which tends to be lower paid than other areas of forensic work, but it can be very rewarding. Working in academic research often gives you the opportunity to discover new techniques, and uncover new trends within the field. Depending on your institution and funding body, you may be able to work with some of the latest technologies, for example looking at the newest generation of Internet of Things devices and how forensic data from these can be used in investigations.</p>
<p class="mce-root">Getting into academic research will require at least an undergraduate degree. Generally, people come to realise that this field is for them in the course of their early studies, staying on for a postgraduate qualification, and then ultimately looking for research teams and groups to join.</p>

<p class="mce-root">Corporate forensics is without a doubt the highest-paid of all the routes into the field, but competition for places is fierce. However, digital forensics is a growing industry, so the number of jobs available is increasing all the time. The level of interest among jobseekers is also increasing, meaning that relatively few job openings exist.</p>
<p class="mce-root">Many digital forensics companies have several different branches: an investigative team that works on cases ranging from civil complaints to criminal lawsuits; a research and development team that comes up with software solutions to speed up these investigations; a sales and marketing team that takes these solutions and sells them to clients, the list goes on and on.</p>
<p class="mce-root">If you have a degree in computer forensics or a related field, you're already well on the way to being qualified for a position like this. However, many companies are looking for people who really stand out from the crowd. Securing an internship remains one of the best ways to end up with a job in the field. It is also worth looking into training options - many of the larger forensic companies, such as Guidance Software, AccessData, and Nuix, run their own training courses which give students a grounding in digital forensic techniques. Having one or more of these on your CV can help you stand out and demonstrate to employers your dedication to the field.</p>

<p class="mce-root">One of the main reasons people give for going into the law enforcement side of digital forensics is wanting to make a difference. As a member of a police force or government agency, you will be tasked with working on a huge range of assignments, from drug investigations to child protection cases. Nowadays, most law enforcement agencies have a specific department devoted to computer forensics, and again, the proliferation of devices means that this field is only increasing.</p>
<p class="mce-root">Working in law enforcement isn't for everyone; often the hours are long and the pay compares unfavourably to what you might earn working for a large company. But for a lot of people, the reward of knowing you have directly helped others is more than a sufficient trade-off.</p>

There is a wealth of information out there to help you get started, and a lot of ways to practice on your own even before you join a course or start learning officially.</p>
<p class="mce-root">Take a look at some of the digital forensics websites and forums, where more experienced practitioners share their knowledge and are available to help you with questions. You can download free tools such as Autopsy and FTK Imager to practice with, and use either your own devices or test images found online to create and work through cases. All of this will be valuable experience for when you start studying or working in the field.</p>
<p class="mce-root">Also consider attending some digital forensics conferences nearby. Many of these give discounts for students, and several run competitions for students to submit posters to be displayed during the conference. Events like these are a great way to meet other people in the industry and start to build your network.</p>
<p class="mce-root">In the next section, we will recommend some resources to help you get started.</p>
