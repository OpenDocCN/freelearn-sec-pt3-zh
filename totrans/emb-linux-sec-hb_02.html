			<h1 id="_idParaDest-26"><a id="_idTextAnchor045"/>Security Starts at the Design Table</h1>&#13;
			<p>Security is more<a id="_idIndexMarker020"/> than a process. Security cannot be an afterthought. Security is a mindset. When you are considering offering a new or upgraded product to the market, security starts at the design table. The choices you make here will define outcomes you may not have even pondered in the past.</p>&#13;
			<p>In the previous chapter, we did a brief review about what embedded Linux systems (AKA appliances) are and often how they solve real-world problems. The next few chapters will focus on the design and build phase. Each chapter will build upon the concepts of the previous, and as you’ll soon readily see, it is all considerations to be aware of.</p>&#13;
			<p>While in the design phase, a product team has the highest chance of success in mitigating future risks. Through proper scoping, planning, and execution, your team can achieve great success in creating a highly productive appliance solution. Each of the factors that we are about to review, if accounted for at this stage, will become a factor toward success, not a risk factor.</p>&#13;
			<p>Security auditors, systems architects, and product managers, all by virtue of their expected job descriptions, are risk mitigators. That’s why we are here doing this right now. Thank you for taking this journey with me.</p>&#13;
			<p><em class="italic">Measure twice and cut once</em> is a saying many of us are quite familiar with. Here in the design phase, I’d say that’s radically insufficient. I say it’s <em class="italic">Measure twice, change rulers, compare the new ruler to the old one, measure two more times with the new ruler, and then consider the cut carefully</em>. If still in doubt, you should get a third ruler (and start again!). I would also recommend a peer review before the initial cut. A peer review is something I cannot recommend highly enough. A second set of eyes (or several more) can often find and point out something you may have overlooked.</p>&#13;
			<p>Truly, I am being overly dramatic. This is for many good reasons. Failing to account for key aspects of the solution can result in a weak or inadequate product. In the worst case, you’re stuck with a smoldering pile of garbage and also putting your career in jeopardy. In this chapter, we are definitely going to dive deep into many factors that get overlooked in the design phase of products. Not all of these risks are purely technical. Yet, each of them alone can create problems. Some are social, some are political, and most are related to design factors that must be vetted.</p>&#13;
			<p>The process flow that this chapter will cover can be illustrated through the following diagram:</p>&#13;

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.1 – Process flow of this chapter</p>&#13;
			<p>In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>What are the business needs that the solution caters to?</li>&#13;
				<li>Who is my target buyer and my target user?</li>&#13;
				<li>Will any specific government compliance standards drive the decision tree?</li>&#13;
				<li>How will we support this appliance solution?</li>&#13;
				<li>Other product-impacting needs and concerns</li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>Let’s get started.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-27"><a id="_idTextAnchor046"/>What are the business needs that the solution caters to?</h1>&#13;
			<p>You’ve got an idea for a new product. That’s awesome. Before you spend time pitching the proposal to management, it’s absolutely a necessity to spend some time where you need to roll up your sleeves and set some clear design goals for the product.</p>&#13;
			<p>Let’s walk through this together. You need to ask yourself some questions and be able to answer them in vast detail. The age of building a technological solution and throwing it on the market just because it’s shiny is long over. Your prospective customers have tight budgets and massive time constraints. Adding value to the customer must be the single greatest attribute of any proposed solution.</p>&#13;
			<p>First, what services exactly will your solution provide to its future end-users? This answer must be a clear and exacting response to this question, <em class="italic">What business need or problem is your appliance solution designed to address in order to add value to the end-customers?</em> To answer this question, one must know a few key points. What exactly is the problem? What are the workarounds (if any)?</p>&#13;
			<p>So, what do we mean by <em class="italic">adding value</em>? Your solution must place a checkmark in several boxes. Next, ask yourself, <em class="italic">How complex this solution is to implement and does the average customer have the in-house ability to design/implement a home-grown solution themselves?</em> The answer must be <em class="italic">My solution adds value to people’s lives or provides a valuable service that otherwise may be hard </em><em class="italic">to obtain.</em></p>&#13;
			<p>If your solution could have easily been designed, built, or implemented by others, then the future chance of selling your idea could be bleak. Solutions that solve complex and difficult problems are those that add immediate value to their customers.</p>&#13;
			<p><em class="italic">Research, research, research!</em> I say to all those who are evaluating or considering creating a new product. <em class="italic">Why?</em> one may ask. My response is crucial yet simple. If someone else has already solved this problem and created a product around it, you are starting in a bad position. The incumbent has the obvious advantage and most likely control of the market.</p>&#13;
			<p>What if there are multiple solutions for this problem already in the market? This is where I jokingly ask you to question your sanity. Your company will have an uphill battle and fight for every possible customer. Here’s where I hope your solution crushes the competition and this journey aids you in your efforts.</p>&#13;
			<p>Now that you are empowered by knowing the exact use cases your product is designed to address, we can move on to our next set of design criteria to account for, and that’s determining who your target <strong class="bold">personas</strong> are.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-28"><a id="_idTextAnchor047"/>Who is my target buyer and my target user?</h1>&#13;
			<p><em class="italic">Why should I care about these personas?</em> or <em class="italic">I thought this book was about security!</em> you <a id="_idIndexMarker021"/>might be thinking silently to yourself. Excellent! I’ve got you thinking. This book is absolutely about security and mitigating risks. This is actually crucial to your future product and company’s success, and we’ll address this in two parts. The answers can be as complex as the personas that your company’s sales teams, product managers, and presales engineers will be interacting with in the future.</p>&#13;
			<p>There is more than an ounce of applied psychology necessary for gathering detailed knowledge of your targeted buyers’ and users’ requirements. This insight will greatly aid in determining which features you must plan for to achieve the technological win and eventually the sale of your embedded Linux systems appliances. Both have vastly different drivers and motivators that explicitly impact what they demand from a solution. Preemptively getting access directly or indirectly to these people within your target industry in order to gather intelligence will be a strategic activity for your teams. Focus groups and surveys can also be an invaluable tool in the requirements information collection effort as well. Use every tool and method at your disposal. Business can be like war, so don’t play fairly. Take every advantage.</p>&#13;
			<p>Before we move on to the details about the various personas’ importance, please indulge me a moment for one more warning. Failure to address the needs and wants of your target audiences will ultimately result in poor adoption rates for the solution. I’d be remiss if I didn’t add in the fact that politics within your customers’ organizations can be a hidden factor as well. Gather as much intelligence as you can before you speak to these personas. Preparation and having answers to questions they will or may ask is crucial. The political and hidden motives of the customer, although not directly involved with security, can easily shift to a security feature discussion or bashing session where your competition is thrown on center stage with you (metaphorically, of course).<a id="_idTextAnchor048"/></p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-29"><a id="_idTextAnchor049"/>The target buyer</h2>&#13;
			<p>The<a id="_idIndexMarker022"/> target buyer can be the hardest persona to account for. They may not be anyone who will be actually involved in the deployment, testing, or usage of your product. These customer personas might be a department head, an executive, someone in the finance department, or a procurement specialist. So, let’s dive into the differences in driving factors for some of these examples.</p>&#13;
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>&#13;
			<p class="callout">The target buyer may be a combination of these examples (that is, an executive and a department head or someone in the finance department and a procurement specialist).</p>&#13;
			<p>It is also a fair statement, depending on the scale and cost of your solution, who and how many different personas might be involved in the decision process to acquire your solution<a id="_idTextAnchor050"/>.</p>&#13;
			<h3>An executive</h3>&#13;
			<p>Generally, they <a id="_idIndexMarker023"/>have the ultimate power and say. Their drivers are more focused on achieving a competitive edge in the marketplace, creating profits, and maintaining enough compliance in order to avoid tarnishing the corporate brand and staying out of jail.</p>&#13;
			<p>Getting an executive to sponsor an initiative based on your project can also mean the difference between success, a reduced adoption rate, or, even worse, a failed deployment altogether. The weight they carry in their respective organizations often can move obstacles for your team, but remember this – if you fail to plan for their requirements in your solution, the very mountains they move might be ones moved against your initiativ<a id="_idTextAnchor051"/>e.</p>&#13;
			<h3>A department head</h3>&#13;
			<p>A department head<a id="_idIndexMarker024"/> can become your easiest ally or your hardest obstacle, as their realm of control and experience is deeply in tune with the needs of their organization. They may have already had experience (or general knowledge) of your solution or a competitor’s solution in the past when they were in a different role. Their security requirements can be both strategic and tactical based on their unique domain knowledge.</p>&#13;
			<p>The department head may also be in favor of a home-grown solution, or your solution may be in the running to replace one they had previously created (which is why they got promoted to department head in the first place).</p>&#13;
			<p>Commonly, a department head persona will also most likely lean on one or more of their staff for their input and consideration. That level of collaboration makes them the most <em class="italic">in the know</em> of the target buyers. Because of this, they often come to the table with their lists of <em class="italic">must-have</em> security features along with secondary lists of <em class="italic">nice-to-hav<a id="_idTextAnchor052"/>es</em>.</p>&#13;
			<h3>A procurement specialist</h3>&#13;
			<p>Procurement specialists <a id="_idIndexMarker025"/>are masters of driving down costs. They are compensated wholly upon that notion. These people are the bane of any sales team’s existence. They truly do not care about the value of a solution or the enablement it provides. Oftentimes, these individuals come from a legal or financial background, which makes sense as their purpose is to negotiate purchasing contracts.</p>&#13;
			<p>In seeking out solutions on behalf of their company, they are often given a shopping list of features, but often, they are not educated exactly on what the solutions do nor how they work. This persona might require additional enablement to understand why your solution is the best. If you can get to them during your design phase, they can help drive the required features and help the product team set an initial price point for your solution. In my experience and my humble opinion, these folks are the toughest customers to deal with in any sales/presales cycle.</p>&#13;
			<p>Identifying and planning for the requirements of your key target buying audience is a challenge, but knowing their drivers gives you an advantage to design against. Now, let’s move on to our next subsection and review the target user b<a id="_idTextAnchor053"/>ase.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-30"><a id="_idTextAnchor054"/>The target user</h2>&#13;
			<p>The <a id="_idIndexMarker026"/>target users are your key influencers. They are the people who will be, hopefully, using your solution on a regular basis. They are the most informed on what features make their lives easier. They will have the greatest level of opinion on your interface and the operation of the appliance. They may already have an older version of your solution or, even worse, a competitor’s solution already in place. This group can make or break a deal. As they are the ultimate consumers of the solution, their influence is key in the procurement of products and services for their organizations.</p>&#13;
			<p>It is not fair, in many cases, to assume this group understands the technology that you are building into the solution. Your solution’s very purpose is to make their jobs easier and to grant them additional capabilities that they may not have on their own. Appliance solutions’ sole purpose is to provide advanced functionality to those who do not have technical abilities or advanced levels of support within the organization for that function.</p>&#13;
			<p>This group is also your best ally in the adoption of your solution. They can give you the greatest intelligence as to what is really happening in the field. Their input can drive functionality and security requirements.</p>&#13;
			<p>We reviewed the most critical personas whose needs and wants in your solution must be accounted for within your design. This is not all-inclusive, but it should give a massive advantage in the elimination of certain guesswork regarding specific security features being required, which security features are a <em class="italic">nice-to-have</em>, and, finally, which security features may be considered optional initially. Take this all with a pinch of salt as the landscape changes, personnel change, and this list of design requirements you are creating is also subject to change.</p>&#13;
			<p>In our next set of key factors to consider, we’ll review the impact of compliance on your product’s de<a id="_idTextAnchor055"/>sign.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-31"><a id="_idTextAnchor056"/>Will any specific government compliance standards drive the decision tree?</h1>&#13;
			<p>The mandate for compliance with one or more government standards has the probability of limiting the functionality of your solution while adding a level of difficulty in its design and preparations for the market. As this book may be available globally, my years of experience are more directly focused on the North American marketplace. It can also be argued that the largest marketplace for embedded systems is North America itself; this fact alone creates the opportunity for manufacturers worldwide to create solutions to sell there.</p>&#13;
			<p>Knowing your target buyers, users, and their locales will obviously determine which compliance standards you’ll need to account for. It is definitely vital to understand that many countries have similar and different restrictions and applicable security laws in place.</p>&#13;
			<p>Many countries leverage standards originating in the US as the foundation. In the US, we also take notice of what other countries mandate. The global security community is as diverse as they are technical. Much as with the open source community, information sharing and peer reviewing exist in their core spirit. Many of these resources we will review in considerable depth and breadth in future chapters.</p>&#13;
			<p>Let’s dive through some example industry verticals and which compliance standards can be applied directly to any computer system in their midst. These examples will highlight initiatives at a federal/country level, but please remember that there can also be state or local legislature driving compliance standards as well. Before we dive in, I want to leave you with yet another disclaimer: worldwide there is a myriad of laws, rules, and regulations that regulate all aspects of businesses; however, with the following list of markets and their primary concerns, we will focus on some of the more important initiatives that will directly impact security and your design specifications. Take a deep breath. Let’<a id="_idTextAnchor057"/>s go!</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-32"><a id="_idTextAnchor058"/>Healthcare systems (and data privacy)</h2>&#13;
			<p>First, let’s talk <a id="_idIndexMarker027"/>about healthcare. The healthcare industry’s customer base in North America alone exceeds 383,000,000 people. Protecting their systems, privacy, and their patients’ data is mandated by laws. Some of them are explained<a id="_idTextAnchor059"/> ahead.</p>&#13;
			<h3>HIPAA</h3>&#13;
			<p>Let’s <a id="_idIndexMarker028"/>start with the US federal government standard known as<a id="_idIndexMarker029"/> the <strong class="bold">Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act</strong> (<strong class="bold">HIPAA</strong>). Since its inception in 1996, HIPAA has driven vast investments and scrutiny in the industry across all of the US. It’s a shining example of how data privacy needs to be handled.</p>&#13;
			<p>Follow this link for more details on the law and its requirements for healthcare systems: <a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/reports/health-insurance-portability-accountability-act-1996">https://aspe.hhs.gov/reports/health-insurance-portability-accountability-act-1996</a>.</p>&#13;
			<p>Other critical standards for healthcare systems that will impact your embedded Linux systems are much more intrusive and may require you to submit your appliance for testing and certif<a id="_idTextAnchor060"/>ication.</p>&#13;
			<h3>IEC 60601</h3>&#13;
			<p>This standard applies to<a id="_idIndexMarker030"/> electrical safety for medical equipment and electromagnetic emissions (such as radio signals, radiation, and Wi-Fi) and defines testing for basic safety.</p>&#13;
			<p>This one standard has many names globally; here are some examples of how other countries follow the standard but call it by a different name:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>Canada calls it <em class="italic">CAN/CSA C22.2 </em><em class="italic">Number 60601-1</em></li>&#13;
				<li>The <strong class="bold">European Union</strong> (<strong class="bold">EU</strong>) calls it <em class="italic">EN 60601-1</em></li>&#13;
				<li>Japan calls it <em class="italic">JIS T0601-1</em></li>&#13;
				<li>Australia and New Zealand call it <em class="italic">AS/NZ 3200.1.0</em></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>This is not an exhaustive list. This is why I recommended researching what standards apply to you. Sadly, I know I will be repeating that from time to time throughout this book.</p>&#13;
			<p>Follow this link for more details on the law and its requirements for healthcare systems: <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/65529.html">https://www.iso.org/standard/65529.html</a>.</p>&#13;
			<h3>CE mark/certification</h3>&#13;
			<p>This is an EU requirement to prove that medical equipment has been assessed and meets strict <a id="_idIndexMarker031"/>safety, health, and environmental standards for healthcare equipment. It also <a id="_idIndexMarker032"/>provides proof of <strong class="bold">Restriction of Hazardous Substances</strong> (globally known as <strong class="bold">RoHS</strong>).</p>&#13;

			<p>Healthcare can be tricky, and as we move onto our next vertical, you should notice the scrutiny intensifies even more. Let’s move on to financial servic<a id="_idTextAnchor061"/>es systems.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-33"><a id="_idTextAnchor062"/>Financial services systems</h2>&#13;
			<p>All over <a id="_idIndexMarker033"/>the world, the financial services industry is massively regulated in order to protect the average consumer. This industry covers a vast range of services from general banking and lending to credit cards, real estate loans, business finance, the stock market, bonds, annuities, and other investment vehicles.</p>&#13;
			<p>As a result, several government agencies have been created. They are tasked with monitoring and regulating various aspects of the financial markets. So, let’s take a look at some of the more important entities (in the US). There are vastly more globally:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>The <strong class="bold">Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</strong> (<strong class="bold">FDIC</strong>) is an agency created by the <a id="_idIndexMarker034"/>US Congress that is tasked with maintaining sustainability and public trust in the US’s financial systems (basically the entire banking industry).</li>&#13;
				<li>The <strong class="bold">Securities and Exchange Commission</strong> (<strong class="bold">SEC</strong>) maintains wide responsibilities<a id="_idIndexMarker035"/> overseeing the securities and stock market industry.</li>&#13;
				<li>The <strong class="bold">Federal Reserve Board</strong> was <a id="_idIndexMarker036"/>established to control the operations of the 12 established Federal Reserve banks and oversight of their operations.</li>&#13;
				<li>The <strong class="bold">Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council</strong> (<strong class="bold">PCI SSC</strong>) was established <a id="_idIndexMarker037"/>to oversee and regulate the credit card industry.</li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>In the US, these entities, along with law enforcement agencies, the <strong class="bold">Internal Revenue Service</strong> (<strong class="bold">IRS</strong>), and <a id="_idIndexMarker038"/>the US Treasury Department, ensure rules and regulations to protect the public are enforced strictly. This situation is similar all over the world.</p>&#13;
			<p>Regardless of what country you reside or work in, this is where technology comes into play. The systems in this industry fall under the governance of many laws and standards for security. Let’s take a look at a few of the big ones globally (not just the US) that can drive more scrutiny in your products’ security footprint:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>The EU’s <strong class="bold">General Data Protection Regulation</strong> (<strong class="bold">EU-GDPR</strong>) applies to any institution that<a id="_idIndexMarker039"/> holds the personal data of any EU resident. Follow this link for more details on the law and its requirements for financial industry systems: <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">https://gdpr-info.eu/</a>.</li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">UK-GDPR</strong> (the British version of EU-GDPR) applies<a id="_idIndexMarker040"/> to any institution that holds the personal data of UK citizens. Follow this link for more details on the law and its requirements for the industry: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/data-protection">https://www.gov.uk/data-protection</a>.</li>&#13;
				<li>The <strong class="bold">Sarbanes-Oxley Act</strong> (<strong class="bold">SOX</strong>) established <a id="_idIndexMarker041"/>critical security standards for financial systems within the US financial services industry. Follow these links for more details on the law and the requirements for the industry:<ul><li><a href="https://www.sec.gov/divisions/corpfin/faqs/soxact2002.htm">https://www.sec.gov/divisions/corpfin/faqs/soxact2002.htm</a></li><li><a href="https://sarbanes-oxley-act.com/">https://sarbanes-oxley-act.com/</a></li></ul></li>&#13;
				<li>The <strong class="bold">Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard</strong> (<strong class="bold">PCI DSS</strong>) was created to<a id="_idIndexMarker042"/> create a uniform policy of requirements to protect systems and consumer data. Follow this link for more details on the law and its requirements for the industry: <a href="https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/">https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/</a>.</li>&#13;
				<li>The <strong class="bold">Bank Secrecy Act</strong> (<strong class="bold">BSA</strong>) regulates <a id="_idIndexMarker043"/>electronic transfers in the banking industry in an effort to prevent the act of money laundering. Follow these links for more details on the law and its requirements for the industry:<ul><li><a href="https://bsaefiling.fincen.treas.gov/main.html">https://bsaefiling.fincen.treas.gov/main.html</a></li><li><a href="https://www.occ.treas.gov/topics/supervision-and-examination/bsa/index-bsa.html">https://www.occ.treas.gov/topics/supervision-and-examination/bsa/index-bsa.html</a></li></ul></li>&#13;
				<li>The <strong class="bold">Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act</strong> (<strong class="bold">GLBA</strong>) enforces <a id="_idIndexMarker044"/>that companies that provide financial services disclose to their customers comprehensive information regarding their information-sharing practices in order to protect their data. They provide a framework for data privacy.<p class="list-inset">Follow this link for more details about the law and its requirements for the industry: <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/privacy-security/gramm-leach-bliley-act">https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/privacy-security/gramm-leach-bliley-act</a></p></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Payment Services Directive 2</strong> (<strong class="bold">PSD2</strong>) is an<a id="_idIndexMarker045"/> EU regulation managing payment services that might be considered quite similar to the US’s PCI DSS regulations. Follow these links for more details on the law and its requirements for the industry:<ul><li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-revised-payment-services-directive-psd2-rpc-opinion">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-revised-payment-services-directive-psd2-rpc-opinion</a></li><li><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_23_3544">https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_23_3544</a></li></ul></li>&#13;

			</ul>&#13;
			<p>OK! Wow – that was a bit intense. Are you ready for a quiz?! I’m just kidding. That was a lot of regulation and government red tape to cut through. Let’s move<a id="_idTextAnchor063"/> on to the next industry.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-34"><a id="_idTextAnchor064"/>Retail and online marketplace systems</h2>&#13;
			<p>Retail and online marketplace systems (otherwise known as e-commerce systems) fall under a lot of the same <a id="_idIndexMarker047"/>regulations as financial services to mandate systems standards. To me, this makes a lot of sense. It’s logical. Both verticals deal with personal data and the handling of financial transactions. Here are some familiar initiatives and some you may not be familiar with. All of these (and more not listed) could be huge factors in retail and e-commerce.</p>&#13;
			<p>Retail has similar scrutiny to the financial services industry as laws such as PCI DSS, EU-GDPR, and UK-GDPR also apply to this sector. However, as this industry also provides a service to the public, its responsibilities extend beyond simple data protection as seen with these next laws:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act</strong> (<strong class="bold">COPPA</strong>) regulates what data can be <a id="_idIndexMarker048"/>collected and used from children under the age of 13 years old along with what things can be marketed to them. Follow this link for more details on the law and its requirements for the industry: <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/rules/childrens-online-privacy-protection-rule-coppa">https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/rules/childrens-online-privacy-protection-rule-coppa</a>.</li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Americans with Disabilities Act</strong> (<strong class="bold">ADA</strong>) (<a href="https://www.ada.gov/">https://www.ada.gov/</a>) enforces online <a id="_idIndexMarker049"/>commerce (that is, websites are compatible with views that enable people with disabilities to view them without discrimination).</li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>So, there you have it. A brief summary of the agencies trying to protect your shopping experiences and your digital privacy has been laid out for your review. Let’s move on to the whale in the room, and that’s<a id="_idTextAnchor065"/> the governments themselves.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-35"><a id="_idTextAnchor066"/>Government and military systems</h2>&#13;
			<p>As a<a id="_idIndexMarker050"/> military veteran and former US government contractor, I view this specific set of compliance standards as near and dear to my heart. OK – I’ll admit there’s been pain and scar tissue, but living up to then exceeding the standards was always in my DNA. That said, you’ll need <a id="_idTextAnchor067"/>to pay close attention here.</p>&#13;
			<h3>US government agencies</h3>&#13;
			<p>The<a id="_idIndexMarker051"/> following is a listing of some of the more prolific US agencies that have a <a id="_idIndexMarker052"/>significantly defined level of oversight in the cybersecurity space and often share their standards internationally. Albeit not an all-inclusive listing, these government agencies are the ones to keep an eye on, and we’ll also be talking about many of their publicly available resources in future chapters:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security </strong><strong class="bold">Agency (CISA)</strong> (<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/">https://www.cisa.gov/</a>): CISA<a id="_idIndexMarker053"/> is the US’s premier cybersecurity agency and leads other government agencies and industry partners in ensuring the digital safety of the country, its citizens, and their digital assets.</li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)</strong> (<a href="https://www.nist.gov/">https://www.nist.gov/</a>): Although <a id="_idIndexMarker054"/>NIST is actually part of the Department of Commerce, NIST’s involvement with cybersecurity is most well known in its certification of systems to security standards.</li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">National Security Agency (NSA)</strong> (<a href="https://www.nsa.gov/Cybersecurity/">https://www.nsa.gov/Cybersecurity/</a>): The<a id="_idIndexMarker055"/> NSA leads US government agencies in cryptology and intelligence gathering, It provides various products and services to government agencies and has been greatly involved in <a id="_idIndexMarker056"/>making <strong class="bold">open source software</strong> (<strong class="bold">OSS</strong>) and Linux more secure for everyone.</li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Department of Homeland Security (DHS)</strong> (<a href="https://www.dhs.gov/topics/cybersecurity">https://www.dhs.gov/topics/cybersecurity</a>): DHS is yet another vastly broad-reaching agency<a id="_idIndexMarker057"/> in the US. Its role in cybersecurity usually involves investigations of cybersecurity crimes and related activities.</li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>Now that we<a id="_idIndexMarker058"/> have taken a look at some key government agencies with responsibilities and units focused on cybersecurity, let’s take a look at <a id="_idIndexMarker059"/>some <strong class="bold">non-governmental organizations</strong> (<strong class="bold">NGOs</strong>) and foreign government agencies that also <a id="_idTextAnchor068"/>have weight on security and standards.</p>&#13;
			<h3>Non-US government cybersecurity agencies</h3>&#13;
			<p>As this<a id="_idIndexMarker060"/> text will hopefully be read in the US and abroad, I wanted to include these agencies in a<a id="_idIndexMarker061"/> separate listing as they too are ones to follow and take notice of their work. They also produce and often enforce cybersecurity within their own domains. Let’s look at a few key examples:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">European Network Information Security Agency</strong> (<strong class="bold">ENISA</strong>) (<a href="https://www.enisa.europa.eu/">https://www.enisa.europa.eu/</a>): ENISA is <a id="_idIndexMarker062"/>focused on setting<a id="_idIndexMarker063"/> security standards that apply across all of Europe. It not only creates policies but also processes and has mechanisms for certifications. It is the top entity to follow in the EU in terms of cybersecurity standards.</li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe</strong> (<strong class="bold">OSCE</strong>) (<a href="https://www.osce.org/">https://www.osce.org/</a>): The <a id="_idIndexMarker064"/>OSCE is a non-profit<a id="_idIndexMarker065"/> organization in which each European country has a voice on economics, counter-terrorism, law enforcement strategies, and (of course) cybersecurity.</li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Cyber and Information Security Division</strong> (<strong class="bold">C&amp;IS</strong>) (<a href="https://www.mha.gov.in/en/divisionofmha/cyber-and-information-security-cis-division">https://www.mha.gov.in/en/divisionofmha/cyber-and-information-security-cis-division</a>): C&amp;IS is <a id="_idIndexMarker066"/>an Indian government division that deals with all <a id="_idIndexMarker067"/>matters of cybersecurity, cybercrime, and national security policies, and also with technology security standards and recommendations.</li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Center for Internet Security</strong> (<strong class="bold">CIS</strong>) (<a href="https://www.cisecurity.org/">https://www.cisecurity.org/</a>): The CIS is a <a id="_idIndexMarker068"/>community-based, not-for-profit<a id="_idIndexMarker069"/> organization that funds itself through the sale of security best practices materials and related services.</li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">National Center of Incident Readiness and Strategy for Cybersecurity</strong> (<strong class="bold">NISC</strong>) (<a href="https://www.nisc.go.jp/eng/index.html">https://www.nisc.go.jp/eng/index.html</a>): The NISC is Japan’s <a id="_idIndexMarker070"/>cybersecurity watchdog. It is<a id="_idIndexMarker071"/> responsible for creating and enforcing standards for commercial and government systems.</li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>Now that we’ve <a id="_idIndexMarker072"/>reviewed some international and foreign government agencies in the cybersecurity space along with their responsibilities, let’s take a more introspective look at the impact and c<a id="_idTextAnchor069"/>riticality definitions of data in the next section.</p>&#13;
			<h3>Impact Levels</h3>&#13;
			<p>The US government has a <a id="_idIndexMarker073"/>well-defined definition of implied levels of criticality to determine a specific level of systems security and scrutiny to be applied. They classify these<a id="_idIndexMarker074"/> levels as <strong class="bold">Impact Levels</strong>. A great graphical depiction<a id="_idIndexMarker075"/> of the implications of these levels can be found on the US <strong class="bold">Department of Defense</strong> (<strong class="bold">DoD</strong>) website – <a href="https://media.defense.gov/2020/May/18/2002302035/-1/-1/1/NAVY_TELEWORK_CAPABILITIES_V14.PDF">https://media.defense.gov/2020/May/18/2002302035/-1/-1/1/NAVY_TELEWORK_CAPABILITIES_V14.PDF</a>.</p>&#13;
			<p>Here’s a quick summary of the<a id="_idIndexMarker076"/> IL determinations by the US DoD:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">IL-2</strong>: Impact Level 2 refers to public or non-critical mission information. Products with <strong class="bold">Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program</strong> (<strong class="bold">FEDRAMP</strong>) authorization achieve this designation automatically.</li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">IL-4</strong>: Impact Level 4 refers to <strong class="bold">Controlled Unclassified Information</strong> (<strong class="bold">CUI</strong>), non-mission critical information, not related to National Security Systems.</li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">IL-5</strong>: Impact Level 5 refers to systems with a much higher sensitivity of CUI, actual mission-critical information, or actual National Security Systems.</li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">IL-6</strong>: Impact Level 6 refers to information systems processing Classified <em class="italic">SECRET</em> data and other National Security Systems.</li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">IL-7</strong>: Impact Level 7 refers to information systems processing Classified <em class="italic">TOP SECRET</em> data and critical National Security Systems.</li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>The US government <a id="_idIndexMarker077"/>takes data classification levels quite seriously, as we have highlighted in the last section. They do not stop there. The US government has a wealth of directives and<a id="_idTextAnchor070"/> standards that we’ll be addressing in our next section.</p>&#13;
			<h3>US government standards and certifications</h3>&#13;
			<p>There <a id="_idIndexMarker078"/>are many federally enforced standards and certifications that are required by government or military institutions. Let’s take a look at the key ones to be aware of:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Federal Information Security Modernization Act</strong> (<strong class="bold">FISMA</strong>): Compliance with the <a id="_idIndexMarker079"/>standards <a id="_idIndexMarker080"/>drawn out by FISMA enforces annual detailed systems security audits in companies (<a href="https://security.cms.gov/learn/federal-information-security-modernization-act-fisma">https://security.cms.gov/learn/federal-information-security-modernization-act-fisma</a>).</li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">FEDRAMP</strong>: FEDRAMP certification<a id="_idIndexMarker081"/> for products and web services enables them to be sold to and utilized by government agencies assuming the products also meet the proper Impact Level requirements (<a href="https://www.fedramp.gov/">https://www.fedramp.gov/</a>).</li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Secure Technical Implementation Guides</strong> (<strong class="bold">STIGs</strong>): These publicly shared guides for <a id="_idIndexMarker082"/>the hardening of operating systems, network components, and applications are the baseline for obtaining and maintaining other government and military certifications. They also serve non-governmental entities with heightened standards that they can apply to their own systems regardless of which industry vertical they belong to. I have personally used these countless times previously in my career (especially when I was a government contractor working on sensitive systems) (<a href="https://public.cyber.mil/stigs/downloads/">https://public.cyber.mil/stigs/downloads/</a>).</li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Common Criteria</strong> (<em class="italic">ISO/IEC 15408</em>): This is a shining example of multinational <a id="_idIndexMarker083"/>collaboration where multiple governments have standardized and enforced adherence to a standard baseline of cybersecurity principles. Many countries participate in this global standard, and several offer certifications to the standards (<a href="https://www.commoncriteriaportal.org/index.cfm">https://www.commoncriteriaportal.org/index.cfm</a>).</li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Federal Information Processing Standards</strong> (<strong class="bold">FIPS</strong>) (<em class="italic">FIPS 140-2/140-3</em>): Both FIPS <a id="_idIndexMarker084"/>standards and their certification enforce detailed adherence to cryptography<a id="_idIndexMarker085"/> via comprehensive testing and certification. <em class="italic">FIPS 140-3</em> is the newer and current standard. This extremely comprehensive<a id="_idIndexMarker086"/> process is not only costly to manufacturers who take their products through it but also time-consuming to the order of multiple years in some cases. NIST is the certifying agency. I have extensive personal experience in this process and have assisted several of my current company’s partners through it. Use the following links for more details:<ul><li><a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/140-3/final">https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/140-3/final</a></li><li><a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/140-2/upd1/final">https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/140-2/upd1/final</a></li></ul></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">The US government standards profile (USGv6/USGv6-r1</strong>) (<a href="https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/usgv6-program">https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/usgv6-program</a>): This program was created<a id="_idIndexMarker087"/> and also enforced by NIST to regulate all systems that use <strong class="bold">Internet Protocol version 6</strong> (<strong class="bold">IPv6</strong>) in<a id="_idIndexMarker088"/> their products.</li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>In summary, we have seen a respectable number of governments asserting influence in the usage of computer systems. If you plan to market your solution to a government entity, it’s clear that your product better bring its security A game as there are a plethora of standards that could apply to your embedded Linux system appliance.</p>&#13;
			<p>We reviewed some critical examples of how compliance needs must be addressed in your product’s design. In later chapters, we will dig deep into how to apply very specific standards, and we’ll have some hands-on exercises for you to practice. Compliance adherence is not one of those <em class="italic">nice-to-haves</em>, as failure to comply may have the detrimental impact of criminal charges or civil liability; that puts your company at risk.</p>&#13;
			<p>Now that we’ve seen how some standards and compliance initiatives will drive the security footprint of your solution, let’s take a look at how your organization will conside<a id="_idTextAnchor071"/>r how to support the solution once it’s sold to your end-customers.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-36"><a id="_idTextAnchor072"/>How will we support this appliance solution?</h1>&#13;
			<p>Another crucial set of<a id="_idIndexMarker089"/> design factors that can also impact your business model for your appliance solution is focused on how you plan to deliver support and services to your customer audience.</p>&#13;
			<p>Support and services planning will directly impact the <a id="_idIndexMarker090"/>security of your appliance. Remote access, <strong class="bold">virtual private network</strong> (<strong class="bold">VPN</strong>), user accounts, patching methodologies, end-user self-support capabilities, and more are a few of the options that must be accounted for on the design table. Now, let’s take a look at some delivery and support models that wil<a id="_idTextAnchor073"/>l impact access controls and the security footprint of your solution.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-37"><a id="_idTextAnchor074"/>Managed service</h2>&#13;
			<p>A <strong class="bold">managed service</strong> offering<a id="_idIndexMarker091"/> allows your company to completely control many aspects of your solutions usage, update cycle, and access control. Regardless of the business model around this, several key factors will need to be addressed architecturally in your solution, such as the following:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>Level of customer (end-user access)</li>&#13;
				<li>Initial network configuration</li>&#13;
				<li>Scale and redundancies</li>&#13;
				<li>Remote access or on-premise access</li>&#13;
				<li>Will the solution be air-gapped?</li>&#13;
				<li>Auditing requirements</li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>A managed services model is not for everyon<a id="_idTextAnchor075"/>e. Let’s move on to our next model, which is the online support model.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-38"><a id="_idTextAnchor076"/>Online support</h2>&#13;
			<p>By online support, I mean <a id="_idIndexMarker092"/>web-based delivery of updates to the appliance and information for the customer. It often may include a method of creating a help request via a web page or via email. There may also be a situation where the user can get help/support online but the appliance itself is offline or air-gapped. With the online support model in place, let’s take a look at key factors that may impact its success:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>How do you account for the initial appliance setup and configuration?</li>&#13;
				<li>Does the appliance have internet access?</li>&#13;
				<li>What method(s) will the appliance use to obtain and process updates?</li>&#13;
				<li>How will you deliver automatic updates vs. user-initiated updates?</li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>Providing online support creates easy access to resources for the end-customer and a simple delivery method for providing information and updates. However, not all business <a id="_idIndexMarker093"/>models (or usage models) will find this acceptable. In this situation, we m<a id="_idTextAnchor077"/>ove on to our next model for those customers: the offline support model.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-39"><a id="_idTextAnchor078"/>Offline support</h2>&#13;
			<p>In this case, the<a id="_idIndexMarker094"/> appliance receives nothing directly from the manufacturing company. The appliance solution itself is presumed to be in a restricted, air-gapped, or non-networked environment. Let’s look at some key considerations that will need to be planned for:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>How do you account for the initial appliance setup and configuration?</li>&#13;
				<li>What me<a id="_idTextAnchor079"/>thod(s) will the user use to obtain and process updates for the solution?</li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-40"><a id="_idTextAnchor080"/>No support/self-support</h2>&#13;
			<p>No support or self-support <a id="_idIndexMarker095"/>is the least common model on the market. It forces the end-user to do everything themselves, while the manufacturer of the solution has no control over the product once it ships. This is the set-and-forget model. This may be appropriate for some very low-cost items such as sensor appliances but ultimately makes your solution <em class="italic">disposable</em> in the eyes of the customer. Now, as this oversimplified limited support model has some cost advantages to your company, there are still a few factors to plan for in order to keep customers happy:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>Initia<a id="_idTextAnchor081"/>l appliance setup and configuration</li>&#13;
				<li>Break/fix options for the end-customer</li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-41"><a id="_idTextAnchor082"/>Replacements</h2>&#13;
			<p>No hardware<a id="_idIndexMarker096"/> platform is perfect. Sometimes, things just break. For some solutions, updating or troubleshooting them in the field (that is, remotely) is just too difficult or unfeasible. The solution for this is rudimentarily simple. Your company would swap out a new system with the customer in order to replace an inoperable unit or to provide the customer with a more updated or upgraded unit. Now, let’s look <a id="_idIndexMarker097"/>at what you must consider and plan for:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>Is customer data backup and transfer between the old and new systems feasible?</li>&#13;
				<li>How do you account for the initial appliance setup and configuration?</li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>As this is a common pain point for any product team, we must still plan for the in<a id="_idTextAnchor083"/>evitable. Now, let’s look at a few other items you may not have planned for.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-42"><a id="_idTextAnchor084"/>Other product-impacting needs and concerns</h1>&#13;
			<p>In this section, we’ll perform continued deep introspection into factors that may have been overlooked or forgotten. In doing so, we’ll be planning for the security and longevit<a id="_idTextAnchor085"/>y of our product and ultimately taking strides toward ensuring its success.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-43"><a id="_idTextAnchor086"/>Hardware life cycle</h2>&#13;
			<p>If you are a <a id="_idIndexMarker098"/>product manager, this section is really geared for you. Planning your alignment in concurrence with your hardware vendor’s support life cycle is crucial in ensuring you have access to all the units and replacement parts for the planned life cycle of your appliance.</p>&#13;
			<p>It is more than helpful to know where in a life cycle your vendor’s current hardware release resides. Most mainstream hardware vendors will maintain a specific platform for 3 to 5 years. During this period, some components or minor motherboard changes are common. Replacement parts may be available for a couple of years beyond this timeframe but at a cost premium.</p>&#13;
			<p>Assuming for a moment that your solution is using an off-the-shelf platform by a mainstream vendor, let’s review a few key considerations:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>How much of a budget will we dedicate to life cycle support?</li>&#13;
				<li>Will minor changes in my vendor’s platform be an issue for the appliance?</li>&#13;
				<li>What is my upgrade and replacement plan for future versions of my appliance?</li>&#13;
				<li>What third-party hardware components do I use in my appliance?</li>&#13;
				<li>How many spare systems and spare parts do I plan to keep on hand for immediate replacements?</li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>Alright… Why <a id="_idIndexMarker099"/>does this tie into security? My answer is simple. If you fail to secure your hardware supply chain, you induce massive amounts of risk in the future in supporting your product once it’s been adopted by end-customers. What does this actually translate into? It becomes an issue if you can no longer support the existing hardware initially deployed and may create a complex situation where your product has multiple platforms that become a support nightmare and a logistics nightmare. Or, even worse, by changing platforms, you introduce an unknown vulnerability or software incompatibility. And let’s be honest, we’re here because we want to reduce risk, right?!</p>&#13;
			<p>Oh no! I just opened a can of worms. So, let’s break it down into the simplest of terms. Securing your supply chain and having spares on hand will save you from the risk of deploying multiple platforms and your product becoming even harder to support. The whole purpose of my guidance here is to help you reduce risk and reduce costs.</p>&#13;
			<p>Let’s walk this together. <em class="italic">How much of a budget will we dedicate to life cycle support?</em> is the single most important question a product manager can ask of a product that is in active sales as this ties directly into<a id="_idIndexMarker100"/> the <strong class="bold">profit and loss</strong> (<strong class="bold">P&amp;L</strong>) accounting that most PMs track daily. Life cycle support is a complex calculation.</p>&#13;
			<p>One must plan for many different types of expenditures:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>Staffing costs</li>&#13;
				<li>Support methodologies (web, email, phone, and so on)</li>&#13;
				<li>Replacement costs</li>&#13;
				<li>Spare parts costs</li>&#13;
				<li>Additional costs that may be incurred by misalignment of hardware or software (or both) with the actual planned solution’s life cycle</li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>Now that we’ve reviewed how the life cycle of your hardware platform can impact the security of your pipeline and product delivery, let’s look at the<a id="_idTextAnchor087"/> obvious adjoining issue tied to the hardware: the operating system life cycle.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-44"><a id="_idTextAnchor088"/>Linux distribution life cycle</h2>&#13;
			<p>Most<a id="_idIndexMarker101"/> Linux distributions, regardless of community or enterprise, have their own predetermined life expectancy. This is intentional. Having a solidly defined life cycle empowers those supporting the distribution to plan their updates, feature releases, and version transitions.</p>&#13;
			<p>This knowledge also enables you and your team to best plan for the needs of your products. Key milestone dates related to your operating system will drive design, deployment/release, and ultimately, the life cycle of your products.</p>&#13;
			<p>The life cycle state will also be directly related to product cost structures. Paid, supported, enterprise-grade distributions incur costs on a per-unit basis. These can take the form of an annual subscription, perpetual license, and additional support costs. Some vendors provide minimalist support for distributions that have exceeded their normal life cycle. This extended life cycle support comes at a premium and usually only relates to a small subset of the operating system. What is also provided in this case is generally only the backporting of security fixes deemed <a id="_idIndexMarker102"/>critical or important. Lesser <strong class="bold">common vulnerabilities and exposures</strong> (<strong class="bold">CVEs</strong>) and bug fixes are not included, nor are new features or new hardware compatibility supported.</p>&#13;
			<p>There are countless Linux distributions available today. Most claim to be in a niche and targeted to specific use cases. Others are leaders in the enterprise and government spaces. Some are easy to use (that is, they target beginners to Linux), and others require deeper knowledge and skill sets that exceed what is common in the workforce today. With there being so many, I thought it best to trim down the list to some of the most common and vocal players in the embedded Linux systems ecosystem.</p>&#13;
			<p>I offer my disclaimer here yet again: this list is not all-inclusive, but these are what most appliances are built upon today in 2024. If I have omitted a distribution that you feel should be on this list, please accept my apologies. Detailing all the possible Linux distributions available today in and of itself could be its own book. These listed distributions are presented to you in no particular order and with no biases. In this section, we’ll review lifespan, payment model, and support cycles. In upcoming chapters, we will go far deeper into several of these operating systems as to how they may or may not best serve your product.</p>&#13;
			<p>How I’ll format and display the data regarding the sampling of distributions you may come across being used as the foundation of embedded Linux systems appliances will go as follows:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>Distribution name</li>&#13;
				<li>URL for the distribution’s main page</li>&#13;
				<li>Summary of the release schedule</li>&#13;
				<li>Primary life cycle duration</li>&#13;
				<li>Licensing/subscription information</li>&#13;
				<li>Support options information</li>&#13;
				<li>Miscellaneous important note (optional)</li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>So, <a id="_idTextAnchor089"/>let’s dive into<a id="_idIndexMarker103"/> some of these great examples, based on the aforementioned format:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;

			<p>Now that we’ve looked at the most likely operating sys<a id="_idTextAnchor096"/>tems and their supported life cycles, let’s move on to other supply chain issues as a whole.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-45"><a id="_idTextAnchor097"/>Supply chain issues</h2>&#13;
			<p><em class="italic">A supply chain issue; how does that tie into security?</em> you may ask. Well, that is a good question to ask. It’s <a id="_idIndexMarker114"/>even more important to have multiple plans to mitigate it. This is vastly more critical if you are manufacturing a hardware-based appliance solution.</p>&#13;
			<p>It is common, if not critical, to align your planned life cycle with your hardware vendors. What if your solution requires additional third-party components? What other sources do you have for spare parts? Is there a plan to maintain some parts on hand at repair facilities? And let’s not forget to ensure that support staff have every possible combination of platform hardware and third-party components in their lab in order to troubleshoot customer issues and provide quality support.</p>&#13;
			<p>Another instance where this adds a level of intricacy is when changes in hardware components induce changes in required drivers, kernel modules, libraries, and so on. This means each combination must be fully vetted, scanned, and validated to the same level of security measures. Keeping the number of combinations to a minimum will ultimately assist your teams in being able to deliver at scale. Otherwise, it becomes death by a thousand cuts; every customer has a slight variation from the next, or even worse, not every system for an individual customer is even the same. There you have it. A security <em class="italic">AND</em> support nightmare on your hands. With each new release or patching schedule, every combination <a id="_idIndexMarker115"/>must be accounted for. This can also impact how you provide updates to your customers and further impact the customer experience.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-46"><a id="_idTextAnchor098"/>Summary</h1>&#13;
			<p>Wow! We’ve covered many different yet all-important criteria that will go into your design and product planning strategies. I highly recommend creating a detailed checklist based on what your needs and desires are for your product’s future. Ensuring the stability, supportability, and longevity of your solution will make it easier to design, create, and sell a better, more secure appliance. Ultimately, you’ll just be giving the end-customer more of what they expect from your solution.</p>&#13;
			<p>In our next chapter, we’ll review how to apply that design criteria to your hardware selection and procurement process.</p>&#13;
