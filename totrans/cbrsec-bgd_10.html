<p>Cybersecurity is a buzzword right now. While it could be assumed to be a high-level, technical, and complex undertaking, in reality, it is just a few precautions that everyone in an organization can take to keep safe. It is not the burden of the IT department to keep everyone, as well as all devices, networks, and systems, safe. Most attacks are not even caused by direct attacks to networks, devices, or systems. Humans are the weakest link in the cybersecurity chain, and taking a few extra security precautions could shield the company from losses. This chapter will provide some of the resources that users in the organization can utilize to achieve this. It will be helpful for all types of users, both technical and non-technical. It will inform the average non-technical users of the security precautions they should take so as not to expose themselves to security threats. It will also give technical IT users a reference point to check the security of their organization or to learn more about the solutions that they need to implement to offer more security to users and digital assets owned by the organization.</p>
<p>This chapter will discuss the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Checklist resources</li>
<li>Cybersecurity advice and reliable information sources</li>
<li>Cybersecurity courses</li>
<li>Cybersecurity threat-intelligence resources</li>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Security Checklist</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The Security Checklist (<a href="https://securitycheckli.st/">https://securitycheckli.st/</a>) is an online platform that all users can refer to for a comprehensive checklist of all the things they need do to be less prone to attacks. It is focused on protecting privacy and preventing exposure to malware and phishing attacks. The Security Checklist is composed of the following items:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Password managers</strong>: There is a big problem in creating unique passwords for all services that you have an account with. Most users reuse the same passwords and this exposes them to more threats; once one account is compromised, hackers can access your other accounts. Many attacks involving the theft of credentials have resulted in such files being sold on black markets. Buyers will try to use the credentials to access other accounts linked with the username. This website offers several options of password managers that users can download and install on Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, and Linux. It also provides reading resources about password managers to help users understand their functions.</li>
<li><strong>Creating strong passcodes</strong>: The next item in the checklist is having a strong passcode. This website gives guidelines on the minimum length and composition of passwords. It also tells users to disable TouchID and FaceID when traveling. It refers users to several websites with in-depth information on how passcodes are broken, how they can be changed on iOS and Android, and how to disable TouchID and FaceID.</li>
<li><strong>Two-factor authentication (2FA)</strong>: Third on the list is the 2FA, which is focused on adding another layer of security to the usual login credentials. 2FA is briefly discussed and guidelines on how it should be set are given.</li>
<li><strong>Encryption</strong>: The checklist features encryption as a security technique to help you remain secure. Encryption is briefly discussed, where the resource explains that encryption prevents data from being read if a thief ever steals your computer or phone. It provides resources that can be used to learn how to encrypt iOS, Android, Windows, and macOS devices.</li>
<li><strong>Freezing one's credit</strong>: Due to the many security breaches that have led to the loss of data belonging to billions of users with different companies, the site informs you that you should assume that your SSN, credit report, and other personal details are known by hackers. To prevent hackers from opening new lines of credit using this information, the site encourages users (in the US) to enable a freeze on credit report checks on all bureaus.</li>
<li><strong>Changing DNS to 1.1.1.1</strong>: Unbeknownst to many users, a lot of the content they access on the internet is facilitated by DNS, which serves the role of translating domain names into IP addresses. However, DNS is highly insecure and it has been established that service providers log and sell data that passes through it. You can switch to using DNS tools that are security and privacy-focused. Cloudflare offers the 1.1.1.1 DNS address that still does domain-name resolution but is faster and more secure than the normal DNS provided by service providers. The site offers sites you can use to learn more about switching to the secure DNS.</li>
<li><strong>VPNs:</strong> Internet connections are not always secure and are prone to man-in-the-middle attacks. In addition, protocol analyzers, such as Ethereal or Wireshark, can be used to capture traffic flowing in a network and identify the sites being visited. VPNs solve this problem by offering a secure internet connection that is encrypted so that all the data you send or receive cannot be read by people snooping on a network. The resource provides six trusted VPN providers: IVPN, Encrypt.me, ExpressVPN, NordVPN, ProtonVPN, and Private Internet Access. Most of these are available on all operating systems.</li>
<li><strong>Webcam covers and privacy screens</strong>: There are websites that contain malicious scripts that can open your webcam without asking for permission and take pictures or videos. It is also possible to turn off the light indicator that shows that a computer's webcam is active. In addition, surfing in public places exposes you to shoulder-surfing, where malicious people simply watch and steal sensitive data when you enter it into a website or system. The site proposes two solutions: webcam covers and laptop privacy screens. Webcam covers make it impossible for hackers to see anything when they hijack the webcam and the privacy screen is a filter that blocks visibility of a screen outside of 60 degrees.</li>
<li><strong>Privacy-first emails, browsers, and search engines</strong>: The website warns that many service providers track and fingerprint devices for the purposes of advertisements. They offer the following alternatives:
<ul>
<li><strong>Browsers</strong>: Brave, Safari, and Firefox</li>
<li><strong>Search engines</strong>: <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">duckduckgo.com</a></li>
<li><strong>Email providers</strong>: ProtonMail, FastMail, and Tutanota</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Reviewing app permissions</strong>: There is an increase in the number of apps that have been requesting excessive permissions to sensitive data that is not required for their primary functionalities. Others have been granted permissions that allow them to act as espionage tools. The most abused permissions are location, microphone, camera, contacts, and messages. Besides apps, there are services that request access to social media accounts but access data that is not relevant to the functions they offer. For instance, a Twitter follower count service might have gotten access to reading messages in your inbox. Part of the security checklist informs users that they should revoke excess permissions from apps and services. The checklist provides resources that guide Android, iOS, Windows, and macOS users on how to manage the permissions they have granted to apps. In addition, the checklist offers resources that can be used to opt out of services that read data from social media accounts.</li>
<li><strong>Social media privacy settings</strong>: A lot of personal information can be obtained on social media networks without much hassle. Hackers often start an attack against a specific target by doing reconnaissance to find out as much information about them as possible. Social media platforms are littered with excessive personal information, such as birthdates, physical addresses, and names of family members. Social media platforms often have privacy controls which most users ignore or do not bother checking.</li>
<li><strong>The security checklist</strong>: A number of resources are given that explain how to make changes to multiple privacy settings on different social media.</li>
<li><strong>Education on phishing attacks</strong>: Hackers do not solely depend on using exploit tools and advanced software to breach accounts. They, at times, just request access from users under false pretenses. Many phishing attacks are being conducted via mail where users are being tricked into sharing sensitive credentials with people who claim to be from legitimate companies. In many cases, the targets are given malicious links that contain exact clones of login pages to some commonly used websites. Once the users enter their details, the hackers proceed to use the details on the correct websites and steal money or data.</li>
<li><strong>Keeping devices updated</strong>: The last item in the checklist informs users that they must keep their software and apps up to date. While it might be easy to know when updates are available for apps or computers, it might not be so obvious for other devices, such as routers. Furthermore, users are not always actively patching software when updates are available. The checklist gives links to authoritative sites that explain why, when, and how users should install updates.</li>
</ul>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Cybersecurity advice and reliable information sources</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Another important category of cybersecurity intelligence is getting credible alerts about new attacks and advice on how to guard against becoming a victim to cybercriminals. The following are some of the sites that offer this information:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Krebs on Security</strong> (<a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/">https://krebsonsecurity.com/</a>): Provides details on cybersecurity news and investigations into cybercrime and related incidences. The website offers lots of updated information regarding happenings in cybersecurity. For instance, at the time of writing, the top post explained how Google was able to stop all phishing attacks against employees as of 2017. As detailed in the post, the company simply got rid of passwords and instead offered employees physical security keys and one-time access codes. The relevance of the post was that Google was going to share this solution with the public by allowing Android phones to serve as physical security keys. However, the implementation would be limited to only Google-linked services. Another relevant post was the admission of a breach by an Italian firm, but two years after the incidence happened. The breaching involved the theft of personal data belonging to more than 2,000,000 customers. Buca di Beppo, the breached company, downplayed the claims for two years. Nevertheless, the company later admitted to having been hacked. However, that came a bit late since customers' data had been posted and sold on black markets.</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">The site is relevant for people who want to read more about the latest cybersecurity news and learn about new security tools released into the market by companies. All posts are thoroughly researched and well-informed. The intelligence gathered can be used by cybersecurity professionals to secure their organizations further, while average users learn more about the dynamics of cybercrime and the importance of having adequate cybersecurity measures.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<ul>
<li><strong>Naked Security</strong> (<a href="https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2019/04/14/can-you-detect-hidden-cameras-in-hotel-rooms-video/">https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com</a>): This website is owned by Sophos, a leading cybersecurity company that offers several security products and services. The website provides detailed cybersecurity news with a focus on informing readers about new cybersecurity tools and how they can be implemented. It also alerts users about new cybercrime incidences and how they can protect themselves against becoming victims. At the time of writing, the most recent post detailed a privacy invasion technique of spy cams in hotel rooms. The post explained how to detect spy cameras in hotels and how to scan the network in hotels to find spy cameras. The names of spy devices will tend to differ from those of normal devices. The post said that, using the IP address of the suspicious device, you can scan the open ports and find out whether it has <strong>rtsp</strong> (<strong>real-time streaming protocol</strong>) or <strong>rtmp</strong> (<strong>real-time messaging protocols</strong>) services running. However, readers are cautioned that this alone is not enough or a sure way to find spy cameras in a network. The website is quite detailed and in all the posts, users can learn something new about cybersecurity.</li>
<li><strong>Dark reading</strong> (<a href="https://www.darkreading.com/">https://www.darkreading.com</a>): A news and advisory website that is targeted at technical readers. The site publishes stories relevant to cybersecurity, informing readers about the skills they should have or the trends they should be aware of when implementing cybersecurity solutions. At the time of writing, one of the top posts detailed the essential skills cybersecurity experts need to have. The posts tend to be detailed but segmented in multiple pages. Nevertheless, the site provides advice for both beginners and experts in cybersecurity and thus is a valuable intelligence resource.</li>
</ul>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Cybersecurity courses</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Due to the dynamic changes in cybercrime, cybersecurity professionals, or those aspiring to be, must keep up to date with skills that are needed in the market. In addition, they must also widen the scope of their knowledge to be conversant with many threats and security solutions. There are websites that offer free training to those willing to learn more on cybersecurity, which we'll look at now.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">SlashNext</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>This cybersecurity intelligence resource is focused on one of the biggest challenges that organizations are facing today: phishing. Even after spending lots of money and other resources in putting up layers of security, companies are still being breached by cybercriminals through their own employees. Phishing has become a nightmare and has claimed many victims.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>For instance, the attack on Yahoo that led to the theft of sensitive information of all of its 2,000,000,000 users was attributed to phishing. Many other companies have been the victim of phishing attacks, where employees simply surrender login credentials, send money, or click malicious links, causing their devices to be infected. SlashNext states that phishing can be initiated via emails, free software on the web, browser add-ons, online chat forums, social media, messages, and popups in browsers. After making the initial contact with the target, the hackers will use all the techniques at their disposal just to win the trust and thus hack the target. SlashNext offers a 30-minute informative webinar on the new types of phishing, why existing solutions are not able to contain the threat, and how organizations can use real-time threat intelligence to help stop phishing attempts before they become successful against employees.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Springboard</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Springboard offers a cybersecurity basics course that is aimed at those looking to do a refresher or start learning about cybersecurity. Learners are given a 38-hour training session that is broken into nine modules. By taking the course, you gain a fundamental understanding of cybersecurity and can develop your skills further by specializing in a few areas.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Cybrary</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Since 2015, Cybrary has been offering free cybersecurity training. The training is broken down into several courses, which you can take as nano-degrees. The advantage of the site is that it gives learners toolkits, practice labs, and practical tests. It is ideal for beginners, intermediates, and experts in the field.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">US Department of Homeland Security</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>This is quite a notable addition to the list of free training sources. The United States is a preferred target for cyberattacks and most of its citizens are not aware of the basics of cybersecurity. The website offers free training to all who are eager to learn more about cybercrime and cybersecurity. Since many attacks against US companies have been industrial espionage, the courses provided on the department's training website are focused on industrial environments. The course is designed for beginners in cybersecurity but experts can take it to specialize in preventing threats against industrial systems. The trainees are given certification upon the successful completion of a course.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>There are many other websites that offer cybersecurity training. However, many of the free academies do not offer quality teaching materials and do not give certifications. Three of the sites listed here do offer certifications and all of them have quality information. Therefore, they are invaluable sources of cybersecurity intelligence.</p>

<p>By now, you have read about and learned how to improve yourself in cybersecurity. Let's now explore the various threat-intelligence resources to further our knowledge base. This section will take you through <strong>Structured Threat Information Expression</strong> (<strong>STIX</strong>), <strong>Trusted Automated Exchange of Intelligence Information</strong> (<strong>TAXII</strong>), <strong>Oasis Open Command and Control</strong> (<strong>OpenC2</strong>), <strong>Traffic Light Protocol</strong> (<strong>TLP</strong>), and <strong>Cyberanalytics Repository</strong> by MITRE (<strong>CAR</strong>). With the knowledge of the aforementioned resources, you will be better equipped to identify threats and vulnerabilities.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Structured Threat Information Expression (STIX)</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Structured Threat Information Expression, commonly known as STIX, is a special language format to exchange threat intelligence related to cyberattacks. STIX is open source, and free to be used by anyone. STIX allows us to share threat intelligence from any point of view, such as suspicion or compromised information (IoC). It also allows us to represent clearly with objects and detailed relationships between them with threat information. STIX is generally shared in JSON format, but can also be represented visually for any analyst to take advantage of the information. The information shared can be easily integrated with security-analytics tools. STIX has 12 domain objects to define a threat element (more information can be found at <a href="https://oasis-open.github.io/cti-documentation/stix/intro">https://oasis-open.github.io/cti-documentation/stix/intro</a> ):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Attack Pattern</strong>: Allows us to describe how threat actors attempt to compromise any target by providing information about the type of <strong>Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures</strong> (<strong>TTP</strong>).</li>
<li><strong>Campaign</strong>: Describes the grouping of attacker behavior for a particular set of malicious activities and attacks that are observed over a period of time against very specific group of targets.</li>
<li><strong>Course of Action</strong>: Defines what action is to be taken to prevent or respond to an attack.</li>
<li><strong>Identity</strong>: This object helps define individuals, organizations, or groups, as well as classes of individuals, organizations, or groups.</li>
<li><strong>Indicator</strong>: It can contain a pattern of threat information that can be used to detect suspicious or malicious cyberactivity.</li>
<li><strong>Intrusion Set</strong>: Describes attacker or adversarial behaviors and resources grouped together as a set, and its common properties are assumed to be orchestrated by an individual threat actor.</li>
<li><strong>Malware</strong>: Information about malicious code and malicious software, which can be used to compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of a victim's data or system.</li>
<li><strong>Observed Data</strong>: Contains information observed on a system or network (for example, a source or destination IP address).</li>
<li><strong>Report</strong>: This object may contain threat information related to the description of a threat actor, malware, attack techniques, or contextual data.</li>
<li><strong>Threat Actor</strong>: This object can carry information about any individuals, groups, or organizations assumed to have malicious intent.</li>
<li><strong>Tool</strong>: Any information about software packages that can be used by adversaries to perform an attack.</li>
<li><strong>Vulnerability</strong>: Vulnerability or bug information of a software that can be directly used by a hacker to compromise a system or network.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a sample JSON structure of STIX:</p>
<pre>{<br/>"type": "&lt;any ond the 12 objects&gt;",<br/>"id": "object--xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",<br/>"created": "yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:00.000Z",<br/>"name": "&lt;Attacker group name and target&gt;",<br/>"description": "&lt;Description of the campagin can be given here&gt;"<br/>}</pre>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Trusted Automated Exchange of Intelligence Information (TAXII)</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The <strong>Trusted Automated Exchange of Indicator Information</strong> (<strong>TAXII</strong>) is a standard way for message exchanges that provides a sharing mechanism of actionable cyber threat information between different organizations and product/service boundaries. TAXII defines concepts, protocols, and message exchanges to exchange cyber threat information for the detection, prevention, and mitigation of cyber threats. Broadly, TAXII covers two primary services of sharing models:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Collection</strong>: This is an interface to access a repository of <strong>Cyber threat intelligence</strong> (<strong>CTI</strong>) objects provided by a <strong>TAXII server</strong>, which further allows a producer to host a set of CTI data that can be requested by TAXII clients and servers to exchange information in a request-response model (more information can be found at <a href="https://oasis-open.github.io/cti-documentation/taxii/intro">https://oasis-open.github.io/cti-documentation/taxii/intro</a> ), shown as follows:</li>
</ul>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/eac88d56-b18b-47d3-806f-2968086c9721.png" style="width:16.50em;height:13.00em;"/></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Channel</strong>: This is maintained by a TAXII server. Channel allows CTI producers to push data to many consumers and consumers to receive data from many producers. TAXII clients usually will exchange information with other TAXII clients in a publisher-subscriber model, shown as follows:</li>
</ul>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/7f7c538f-77b7-4e2c-83c7-0807546998d4.png" style="width:33.33em;height:34.08em;"/></p>

<p>OASIS <strong>Open Command and Control</strong> (<strong>OpenC2</strong>) is a technical committee that focuses its efforts on artifacts that are generated by the OpenC2 community forum. The OpenC2 TC was chartered to draft documents, specifications, or other artifacts to support the needs of cybersecurity commands and control in an industry-standard manner. The Technical Committee also leverage any preexisting standards to a great extent and practically identify gaps pertaining to the command and control of technologies that provide or support cyber defenses (<a href="https://www.oasis-open.org">https://www.oasis-open.org</a> ).</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Traffic Light protocol (TLP)</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The <strong>Traffic Light Protocol</strong> (<strong>TLP</strong>) was created in order to facilitate the sharing of information. TLP is a set of designations used to ensure that sensitive information is shared with the appropriate audience. It employs four colors to indicate expected sharing boundaries to be applied by the recipient(s), and the different degrees of sensitivity and the corresponding sharing considerations to be applied by the recipient(s). TLP only has four colors; any designations not listed in this standard are not considered valid by FIRST.</p>
<p>TLP is a simple and intuitive schema to indicate when and how certain sensitive information can be shared, for more repetitive and effective collaboration, but on the other hand TLP is not to be treated as <em>"control marking"</em> or classification. TLP is optimized for easy adoption, human-readable, person-to-person sharing; it can also be used in automated sharing. The source who is sharing the threat information is responsible for making sure that the recipients of the TLP information have complete understanding of the sharing guidelines of TLP. In case the recipient wants to share the information further, they must obtain explicit permission from the owner of the information.

<p>IntelMQ is a platform for the security teams in any CERT, CSIRT, or other security operations. This platform is a community-driven initiative by the Incident-handling Automation project by ENISA, CNCS (National Cyber Security Centre—Portugal), CERT.AT, CERT-EU, and CERT.BE for collecting and processing security feeds by leveraging a message-queuing protocol. IntelMQ is focused on reducing the complexity of system administration, writing new modules for new data feeds, using a common format for sharing by JSON, integrating with common existing tools, providing flexibility to store information in popular log collectors, such as Elasticsearch and Splunk. This platform also offers the flexibility to create custom blacklists for your own use and to share threat intel by the HTTP RESTFUL API. Full details on its usage and an implementation guide can be found at <a href="https://github.com/certtools/intelmq">https://github.com/certtools/intelmq</a>.</p>

<p>This chapter focused on valuable resources for security intelligence. We looked at three broad resources: security checklists, news or advisory sites, and cybersecurity training websites. The security checklist discussed was thorough and takes the user through the A-Z of security. It is aimed at ensuring that they protect themselves and their devices from hacking, espionage, scams, and privacy infringement. The checklist has identified some of the security tools that users need to have to ensure that they secure their devices. It has also highlighted some of the security changes that users should take regarding the exposure of personal information on social media. The chapter looked at the trustworthy news sources, which double as cybersecurity advisers. The websites reviewed provide well-researched information about cybersecurity incidences in the real world and they break down how the incidences happened and how they can be prevented. For instance, one website featured the privacy issues of hotel rooms having spy cameras. It explained a relatively easy way that a tech-savvy person could track the spy cameras through the use of network and port scans. Finally, the chapter looked at cybersecurity training resources and highlighted four resources. The first one offers training on phishing while the others offer a wider variety of courses with certifications. All the discussed resources are invaluable to anyone with interest in cybersecurity either as a practitioner or for the sake of securing themselves from attacks.</p>
