                    <h1 class="header-title">Knowledge Check and Certifications</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>With eLearning becoming more popular than the traditional classroom approach, many people are acquiring important skills without stepping into a classroom. Some organizations have opted to offer free training programs, particularly in the field of cybersecurity, to increase the number of professionals that can reliably counter cybercriminals. In addition, there are many threats that specifically target users in organizations. Organizations are responding to these crimes by enrolling employees in online classes instead of the traditional seminar to teach basic concepts. Learning cybersecurity skills online is highly convenient, especially for those aspiring to start careers in it. The eLearning space is full of incredible knowledge sources. There are fears that some do not offer quality training. Other learning platforms do not cover all the requirements of a given course. However, there are some learning platforms that are licensed to offer training and can give learners certifications to prove that they went through a recognized platform and met all assessment expectations, and were awarded a certificate. This chapter will look at the need to be certified and how to choose the right places and certifications to study for. It will discuss the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The need to get a certification</li>
<li>Choosing certifications and vendors</li>
<li>Certifications, to show what you know</li>
</ul>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">The need to get a certification</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>In the current market, certifications could impact your career, whether you are employed or working as a freelancer. The following are some of the reasons why you should strive to get certifications.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">They show employers that you take initiative</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>In the job market, having a college degree is just the norm. Most degrees tend not to specialize fully in a certain field. However, taking a certification course in cybersecurity makes you stand out from the crowd. While completing a degree course is still valuable, you get an added advantage by having a certification in a certain niche. Certifications often offer skills that are highly relevant to specific jobs. For instance, if you take a penetration testing course, you get skills that are highly relevant for all security analyst jobs. Having a certification is, therefore, highly valuable. It shows employers that you took the initiative to hone your skills in a specific niche, thus you are better qualified for the job you are applying to.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">They reflect your abilities in a specific niche</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>There are fears in the job market of onboarding highly qualified candidates on paper that have poor practical skills. Degrees tend to be misleading since a student could have passed in the easy and less relevant courses to a job but failed in the most important courses. In addition, the assessments in degree programs tend not to be thorough. They do not expose learners to challenging situations where their abilities are tested to the fullest. The degree certificate will not reflect the strong or weak points of a candidate. On the contrary, certifications tend to be thorough and learners have to prove their skills in several assessments to be considered successful in the course. Some certifications also provide details about the performance of a learner in specific modules. They assure employers that the skills taught were assessed to the full extent and you showed competence in all of them. Therefore, employers will have fewer worries about onboarding you.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">They equip you with knowledge for a specific job</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The cybersecurity field is highly reactive to change. New threats will trigger new skill requirements, and companies will start looking for experts that have these skills. Degree programs tend to be slow to change, thus it is hard for universities to alter their courses just because of a new threat. Fortunately, certifications are robust and many vendors will assess the need for skills in the market and tailor their training accordingly. Taking some certifications early enough gives you the advantage of getting in-demand jobs with a good salary. Degree programs are not designed to give learners such rapid training to capitalize on gaps that arise in the market.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">They can kickstart a career in cybersecurity</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The advantage of certification courses is that they are not fixated on your undergraduate degree. While having a relevant IT degree is good, it is not always important and neither is it used as a delimiter to the people that can take certifications. Therefore, if you want to start a new career altogether, taking certifications will be beneficial. They will save the cost and time of going back to university to take a four-year degree.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">They give your clients confidence</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>This applies to professionals that work outside formal companies, those who provide consultancy or auditing services as sole contractors. Clients will be understandably hesitant to trust such people with sensitive data and systems. Being a certified expert in your field gives your clients confidence in your abilities. They are assured that you are a professional and thus can be trusted with all the necessary data and systems.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">They market you</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Certifications show that you have more skills than the average degree holder in a certain field. In the workplace, certifications can lead HR to consider you for promotions to higher ranks or to increase your remuneration to match market rates. For those that operate outside formal employers, certifications work to your advantage as they show clients that you are more skilled than other freelancers or temps. The names of the reputable institutions where you got a certification may also work to your advantage. Employers will overlook other applicants if they find that you have certifications in various areas.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Choosing certifications and vendors</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>There are some factors that you should consider before committing to taking a certification and with a given vendor, let's look at them now.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">The reputation of the vendor</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Vendors that have been in the eLearning space for some time are recognized by many organizations. Start-ups, on the other hand, are viewed with suspicion. It is therefore wiser to take certifications with vendors that are known or have been offering training for several years.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">The length of the course</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Certifications are given after the successful completion of a course. Most courses run for a few months, mostly three or four. However, some vendors extend the duration of courses and often have learners go up to six months for a course, while others offering it in four months. Assessing the duration of the course is important to ensure that you are not taken advantage of through longer courses with higher fees.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Feedback from former learners</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Some vendors have well-established feedback mechanisms where former students leave feedback about their instructors and the overall quality of the course. Some instructors are simply not good while some courses are not in-depth. Taking the time to review feedback from students on websites, Google Reviews, and social media pages might save you some frustration later on.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Support for learners</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Some online learning platforms are poorly structured where learners are only given materials and automated tests after certain periods of time. It is therefore important for you to do research on the level of support that learners are given while taking the course.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">The credibility of the certification</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Certifications should be provided by learning institutions that are licensed to do so. However, some websites offer their own certifications, which are not recognized anywhere. Therefore, before enrolling in a course, it is important to check whether the company offering it is licensed to do so.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Job market demands</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The job market dictates the skills that you should have. Ideally, learners should look for courses that lead to in-demand careers. For instance, the rise of cyberattacks has caused the market to develop an increased demand for penetration testers. Getting a pen test certification puts you ahead in the job market.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Effective cybersecurity requires participation from all</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Ask a random person on the street what cybersecurity means, and you might get a response that refers to the most recent big data breach. It's hard to ignore being constantly told by major news outlets that the <em>private</em> in private information is a bad joke, and that not a single person who has ever entered so much as their favorite color into an online form is safe from black-market traders, unscrupulous governments, internet hacktivists, and whatever other threats you can possibly imagine. Push the question a little further, and your random person on the street might tell you all the things they do to stay safe online—and all the things they don't do. At the very least, you would probably conclude that awareness of cybersecurity issues has dramatically increased in the public sphere. Awareness is, to be sure, a crucial step in bolstering security, whether in a corporate context or a more personal one. But awareness is not enough.</p>
<p>As members of a digital, networked society, we shouldn't simply be aware of our problems. Rather, we should be fixing them. We often fail to do that, though, choosing instead to just accept bad outcomes rather than address their root causes.</p>
<p>This is completely understandable when you think about the fact that security problems often seem insurmountable. What can we as individuals do, even if it's just to protect our own personal information? There are too many points of failure, too many factors that are out of one person's hands.</p>
<p>So rather than struggle independently with rudimentary tools and limited help from others, the most logical choice is to shift our focus and embrace a new standard: a culture of cybersecurity. To put it another way, we need a collective effort to share valuable security knowledge, strategies, best practices, and more with our fellow digital citizens. If we want effective cybersecurity, we all have to play a part.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">What's in it for me?</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>There's some truth in saying that laziness is a key element of human nature, but that excuse is too simplistic and dismissive. It's not that we can't be bothered to exercise due diligence, it's that we haven't been properly motivated. <em>"What's in it for me?"</em> is a fundamental unspoken question of cybersecurity—one that demands our attention.</p>
<p>When we cast blame on average users for failing to regularly change their many passwords across many different sites and systems, we seem averse to understanding why they've failed to do so. Only when it is too late, when users' own identities are stolen, do they acknowledge the importance of such a security practice.</p>
<p>What impetus did they have to incorporate this practice sooner, though? Too often, they've simply been told what to do without truly understanding why they need to do it. Maybe they read a brief, <em>Top 10 User Security Guidelines</em> article, on the web or maybe a colleague hurriedly mentioned a few personal security tips on a lunch break. Maybe their employer sent out a security-minded email that the user didn't really take seriously. While these actions provide a decent start, they aren't sufficient. Superficial commentary alone won't foster an adequate or comprehensive cybersecurity culture.</p>
<p>The key to fostering this culture, then, is substance. One of the most substantive ways to inspire others to be proactive is to get them to relate to the situation. People often fall into the trap of thinking about their computer use too abstractly, as if what they do online is far removed from actual real-world consequences. To get them to understand the gravity of their digital actions, we need to get them to shed this outdated mode of thinking.</p>
<p>When the average computer user leaves their house to go to work, they lock the front door. What about when they leave their desk to go to lunch? Do they leave their workstation unlocked for any passerby to use? Just like physical doors, we open cyber doors all the time—and when such doors open to something personal or sensitive in nature, we must lock them behind us to keep that information secure.</p>
<p>Not everything in the cyberworld has an analogue in the real world, and that can present a unique challenge in fostering a security-conscious climate. To go back to the passwords example, the average homeowner probably doesn't visit a locksmith every month to have the lock to their front door changed.</p>
<p>If you can communicate to users, however, that time is a critical component of any hacker's attempt at brute-force password cracking, the importance of regularly changing passwords becomes more obvious. In this case, the answer to <em>"What's in it for me?"</em> is simple: you stay one step ahead of attackers who are always refining their methods, and your critical information stays safe.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">A culture of continuous monitoring</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>An effective cybersecurity culture has many dimensions, but one of the most important is continuous monitoring. For all of us as users, being able to monitor our online presence for misuse is crucial. Unfortunately, it's easy to feel that your online presence is stretched thin, and that much of it is beyond your control. That's why it's helpful to keep an inventory of your website accounts, passwords, and email addresses.</p>
<p>Password managers such as <strong>KeePass</strong> and <strong>LastPass</strong> make this much easier, while also using encryption to keep the inventory confidential. You can also use email as a hub for all of your other account activity. Many websites and services have options to send email alerts when key account configurations change. The quicker you're informed about these changes, the quicker you can confirm—or deny—their validity and take appropriate action.</p>
<p>This can mean the difference between finding out immediately that a hacker has changed your online bank account password, and finding out when you next sign in—after a massive withdrawal.</p>
<p>It's not just end users who need to contribute to a strong cybersecurity culture—businesses have a lot of catching up to do as well. Just like with users, continuous monitoring is essential. Minding your data, whether in transit or at rest, is a proactive approach to security that is often sorely lacking in the enterprise world.</p>
<p>Many of the breaches that we've all heard about weren't noticed until months, or even years, after the breach actually happened. Attackers exfiltrated data off servers so long ago that it's hard to know exactly what was stolen. This is the last position you want your business to be in, and it's vital to have solutions, such as <strong>Security Information and Event Management</strong> (<strong>SIEM</strong>), always keeping your cybersecurity personnel up to date on any suspicious activity right when it happens. After all, it's the people in your organization who spread and maintain your culture, not the automated machines and software. There's no better way to assure the growth and development of a strong culture of security than through training and certification. Taking a master class and earning a certification, such as the <em>CyberSec First Responder: Threat Detection and Response</em> credential offered by CertNexsus (Logical Operations), will prepare your team to face any threat.</p>
<p>Don't wait another week, or month, to start changing the culture around you. Take action today, whether it's pursuing a cert, upgrading security software and tools, or even just changing those long-dormant passwords. The more effort that each of us puts into creating a culture of cybersecurity, the brighter our shared digital future will be.</p>
<p>The usual perception of cybersecurity among the masses revolves around data breaches. However, most people fail to understand why such breaches occur in the first place. While all the netizens were furious during the Facebook data breach that affected almost 50,000,000 users, no one was willing to get to the root cause of such attacks. This knowledge gap acts as fodder on which cybercriminals breed. Therefore, it is imperative to bridge this gap in a holistic manner to thwart cybersecurity challenges.</p>
<p>In the next section, we will talk about the various certifications needed for cybersecurity professionals to hone their skills and stay ahead of bad actors.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">CompTIA Security+</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>This certification is actually a good starting point for security professionals, which is offered by CompTIA. It gives the individual an opportunity to gain knowledge about security infrastructure, identity management, risk evaluation and mitigation, and also a fair amount of cryptographic knowledge. This could be a good start for individuals working as system administrators and in IT infrastructure services. It might give you that overlap in transitioning from an existing role toward more a security-centric role. One of the best parts of this certification is that its vendor-neutral, which means it covers skills in general security concepts and is not focused toward any particular product. It is considered an entry-level certification by many, but it can also be useful if you have at least a few years of IT experience. The CompTIA Security+ certification is also approved by the US DoD Directive 8140/8570.01-M requirements. There are many options available to complete this certification, but you can also choose to do it in the self-paced manner, all by yourself, and then attempt the exam.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">CompTIA PenTest+</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>This certification from CompTIA offers hands-on, performance-based, and multiple-choice questions, to ensure each candidate possesses the skills, knowledge, and ability to perform tasks on systems. The PenTest+ exam also includes management skills used to plan, scope, and manage weaknesses, not just to exploit them. You will gain penetration-testing, vulnerability-assessment, and management skills; this exam meets the ISO17024 standards and is ANSI-certified.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">CompTIA Cybersecurity Analyst (CySA+)</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>This is another certification offered by CompTIA, to allow individuals to gain skills for behavioral analytics for networks and devices, so that they can prevent and detect cybersecurity threats. CySA+ is considered an intermediate-level cybersecurity analyst certification. This certification focuses on teaching you about intrusion-detection and response skills, along with some coverage of advanced persistent threats. You will be able to gain skills about how to perform data analysis on the threat data collected from various sources and interpret the results of your analysis to identify threats, risks, and vulnerabilities for your business and organization. You will also gain skills relating to how to use various threat-detection tools once you complete this training. This certification also meets the US DoD Directive 8570.01-M requirements.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">CompTIA Advanced Security Practitioner (CASP+)</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>CASP+ is the ideal certification for technical professionals who wish to remain immersed in technology as opposed to strictly managing. CASP+ validates advanced-level competency in risk management, enterprise security operations and architecture, research and collaboration, and integration of enterprise security.</p>

<p>Here is the CompTIA cybersecurity career pathway:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/02b63412-26ce-4fd2-a315-79ce98962b87.png" style="width:28.25em;height:19.92em;"/></p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">EC-Council, Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH)</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>This is one of the few very popular certifications in the cybersecurity community from the past decade or so. I never see any decline in enthusiasm from professionals who want to start in cybersecurity or just want to understand the attacker's perspective behind any security breaches and attacks. This certification is offered by EC-Council, they also offer a range of other certifications for security professionals. This certification focuses on the <em>"White Hat Hacker"—</em>a concept that defines how you can use the same techniques as the bad guys to proactively find and prevent attacks. It teaches you how to think like an attacker, and learn how actual attacks are carried out and using what means. This certification also exposes you to the knowledge of hacking practices, such as foot-printing, reconnaissance, scanning the network for vulnerabilities, enumeration, and knowing the internal working mechanisms of Trojans, worms, and viruses. It also teaches you about how to use sniffers, how DoS and DDoS attacks work, and how you can use social engineering when you are doing a threat assessment. Apart from focusing on network-based and social engineering attacks, CEH brings in the concepts of web hacking, how webservers are attacked and what you can expect when you are preventing such an attack, and SQL injection attacks and how to perform them on your corporate applications to find vulnerabilities proactively. Last but not least, this also covers evading IDS, firewalls, and honeypots. This certification can be best achieved by attending any five-day training course, and it is highly recommended to take this as classroom-based so that you can gain more as a team and get the opportunity to use the lab set up by the trainers to give you first-hand experience.</p>

<p>EC-Council also offers another certification for individuals who wish to take up a career in the digital forensics space: <strong>Computer Hacking Forensic Investigator</strong>, commonly known as <strong>CHFI</strong>. As the demand for forensic investigators is at its peak with the rise in cyberattacks, this certification gives you the jump start to be one of those digital forensic investigators who helps the industry to find out evidence in a post-breach scenario. As mentioned in our earlier chapters, a digital forensic investigation is the process of identifying the evidence and analyzing it to create reports so that the findings can support the legal process to prosecute criminals, and so you can use the information to prevent future attacks. The CHFI certification will expose you to the concepts and processes of computer investigation and analysis techniques to determine pertinent legal evidence. This evidence may be required for a wide range of computer crime or any other forms of digital misuse, which may include theft of trade secrets, theft of or destruction of intellectual property, and fraud. During the CHFI certification and training process, you will learn about using various methods to discover data from a computer system involved in digital crime, or in certain cases recovering deleted, encrypted, or damaged files.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP)</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p><strong>Certified Information Systems Security Professional</strong>, or <strong>CISSP</strong> as it is known in the industry, is a certification granted by the <strong>International Information System Security Certification Consortium</strong>, known as <strong>(ISC)²</strong>. This is one of the must-have certifications for professionals and is very highly regarded in the security community. CISSP focuses on a variety of topics related to information security. As part of this certification process, you will have to learn about eight domains of security:</p>
<ul>
<li>Security and risk management</li>
<li>Asset security</li>
<li>Security architecture and engineering</li>
<li>Communication and network security</li>
<li><strong>Identity and Access Management</strong> (<strong>IAM</strong>)</li>
<li>Security assessment and testing</li>
<li>Security operations</li>
<li>Software development security</li>
</ul>
<p>Unlike other certifications where you may plan to target them without prior experience in security, CISSP mandates you have at least full-time experience of five years in two or more of its eight domains. But they also offer waiver of one year, for candidates who have a four-year college degree or a master's degree. Does this mean that candidates who do not have the required experience cannot achieve this certification? No, even they can appear for this certification, but they will then be receiving Associate of (ISC)² designation once they pass the required CISSP examination, and that will be valid for a maximum of six years. Within this period of six years, you will need to obtain the required experience and submit it to (ISC)² for certification as a CISSP. Upon acceptance of the professional experience requirements by (ISC)², the certification will be converted to CISSP status. You can train with any nearby institutes, online providers, or independent study by reading and learning from the various books available in the market.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Certified Cloud Security Professional (CCSP)</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>If you are already working in cloud technology, and are looking to advance your career from a cloud security perspective, this is the certification that you should start with. It is jointly designed by (ISC)² and the <strong>Cloud Security Alliance</strong> (<strong>CSA</strong>) to provide skill enhancement for cloud security professionals by providing the required knowledge and skills, by covering topics such as cloud security design, implementation, architecture, operations, controls, and compliance with regulatory frameworks. This professional certification will allow candidates to learn the following six domains, focusing on cloud security:</p>
<ul>
<li>Architectural concepts and design requirements</li>
<li>Cloud data security</li>
<li>Cloud platform and infrastructure security</li>
<li>Cloud application security</li>
<li>Operations</li>
<li>Legal and compliance</li>
</ul>
<p>There is certain basic experience that you are required to have: a minimum of five years' work experience in information technology, out of which three years must be in information security and one year in one or more of the six domains of the CCSP. A candidate that doesn't have the required experience to become a CCSP may become an Associate of (ISC)² by successfully passing the CCSP examination.</p>
<p>The Associate of (ISC)² will then have six years to earn the five years of required experience. Alternatively, you can appear for this certification without any prior experience, but you will then receive an Associate of (ISC)² designation once you pass the required CCSP examination, and that will be valid for a maximum of six years. After five years of gaining experience, you can claim the CCSP certification:</p>

<p>Cisco offers top-of-the-line industry certifications, and it is also a great way to kickstart your security career, if you want to focus on the network security side of the cyber world. Cisco certifications are mainly split into four major categories, the first is the entry-level certification, <strong>CCENT</strong>, the second is associate certifications, which is the <strong>CCNA</strong> and <strong>CCDA</strong> range of certifications, the third is the professional certifications which cover the <strong>CCNP</strong> and <strong>CCDP</strong> range, and the last one is the expert level, which covers the <strong>CCIE</strong> and <strong>CCDE</strong> range. For more serious professionals who want to get deeper into network design, architecture, and security, Cisco certifications also cover architect certifications under the acronym <strong>CCAr</strong>. The best part of the Cisco certifications is that they have split each level into nine different categories to make it easy for you to choose the path you want to take for your career and specific technical field: Routing &amp; Switching, Design, Industrial Network, Network Security, Service Provider, Service Provider Operations, Storage Networking, Voice, Datacenter, and Wireless. The split also makes sense because the network subject is huge and you cannot learn everything in one certification. Well, you may choose to have the certifications in all the nine categories, if you have enough time and resources (I am aware of very few people in the real world who have a series of these certifications), it's just that you have to take them one by one, and gain expertise in them. Let's look at some of these certifications (the rest of them can be found at <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/training-events/training-certifications/certifications.html">www.cisco.com/c/en/us/training-events/training-certifications/certifications.html</a>).</p>

<p>This is an entry-level, basic certification. As a result of this certification attempt, you will learn the basic concepts of networking, how to perform jobs such as network support, and how to implement, operate, and troubleshoot a small enterprise or branch network. You will also learn basics of network security. This certification certainly opens up careers in networking if you are looking for one. This is also the foundation for other certifications from Cisco, such as CCNA. Because this is a very basic type of certification, in my opinion, anyone who is in the field of IT can try this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Basic understanding of <strong>Quality of Service</strong> (<strong>QoS</strong> ).</li>
<li>A module on virtualization and cloud services.</li>
<li>Exposure to network programmability related to WAN, access and core segments.</li>
<li>Learn foundational elements of network layers 1-3. Understanding these layers is important from a core routing and switching perspective.</li>
<li>Understanding the fundamentals of firewalls, wireless controllers and access points.</li>
<li>Learn about IPv6 and basic network security.</li>
<li>Access to labs to try the configuration commands with use cases provided during the lab exercises.</li>
</ul>

<p>CCNA Routing and Switching is yet another highly-regarded certification in the IT networking world, almost all networking engineers have this certification at the start of their networking career. If you are planning to be one of them, you can expect to learn how to implement, operate, and configure an enterprise network, learn about IPv4 and IPv6 networks and about LAN Switch and IP router, how they work, and how to configure them. You will also learn about WAN and other security threats to networks. Last but not least, it also teaches you to troubleshoot the network and about network devices related to routing and switching. Apart from the topics that you may have already covered as part of CCENT, you will learn some additional skills:</p>
<ul>
<li>You will be able to manage a mid-size LAN with multiple switches, VLANs, trunking, and a spanning tree</li>
<li>Get a grasp on troubleshooting IP connectivity</li>
<li>Skills related to configuring and troubleshooting <strong>Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol</strong> (<strong>EIGRP</strong>), <strong>Open Shortest Path First</strong> (<strong>OSPF</strong>) in IPv4 and IPv6 environments</li>
<li>You will be able to build WAN by defining its characteristics, functions, and components</li>

<p>This is one if the best cybersecurity training courses you can take. Offensive Security's training courses focus on offensive security, specifically the field of penetration testing. Due to the large number of specializations from the information security domain, the most suitable course for you depends on what you are interested in.</p>
<p>The Offensive Security, <strong>Penetration Testing with Kali Linux</strong> (<strong>PwK</strong>) course focuses on modern techniques used by penetration testers all across the globe, so it would be a great start for you.</p>
<p><strong>Cracking the Perimeter</strong> (<strong>CTP</strong>) focuses on exploit development, web application, and WAN attacks, which are also useful for pentesters; however, PwK teaches you the core skills that are required to be a good pentester. CTP also requires advanced knowledge of different offensive techniques, so it is not recommended for beginners. If you feel you possess the required knowledge to take it, feel free to try the following CTP course-registration challenge: <a href="http://www.fc4.me/">http://www.fc4.me/</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to PwK and CTP, they also have a course devoted to wireless penetration testing, Offensive Security Wireless Attacks (WiFu).</p>
<p>Before registering for a course, we advise you to look through each course syllabus and decide which one covers what you are interested in. Each of the courses has a syllabus available online to see what topics are covered: <a href="https://www.offensive-security.com/information-security-certifications/oscp-offensive-security-certified-professional/">https://www.offensive-security.com/information-security-certifications/oscp-offensive-security-certified-professional/</a>.

<p>OSCP is one of the most recognized and respected certifications for info security professionals. To become certified, you must complete Offensive Security's PwK course and pass the 24-hour hands-on exam. For hands-on experience, each student receives access to a virtual penetration testing lab where techniques learned within the course can be practiced. The OSCP examination consists of a virtual network that contains targets of varying configurations and operating systems. At the start of the exam, the student receives the exam and connectivity instructions for an isolated exam network that they have no prior knowledge of or exposure to.</p>

<p>By taking an approach where an understanding of the anatomy of an attack is developed, the <strong>CyberSec First Responder</strong> (<strong>CFR</strong>) cybersecurity certification ensures individuals have the high-stakes skills needed to serve their organizations before, during, and after a breach.</p>
<p>A CyberSec First Responder is the first line of defense against cyberattacks that can cost an organization valuable time and money. The CyberSec First Responder cybersecurity training and certification program will prepare security professionals to become the first responders against cyberattacks by teaching students to analyze threats, design secure computing and network environments, proactively defend networks, and respond/investigate cyber security incidents:</p>

<p>The US Department of Commerce's <strong>National Institute of Standards and Technology</strong> (<strong>NIST</strong>) created the NIST Cybersecurity Framework in response to a Presidential Executive Order, <em>Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity</em>. The framework, developed in collaboration with the industry, provides guidance to organizations on ways to better manage and reduce cybersecurity risk. The NIST Cybersecurity Framework Core presents key cybersecurity outcomes identified by the industry as helpful in managing cybersecurity risk. The Core comprises four elements: functions, categories, subcategories, and informative references. The following diagram shows the five stages of the NIST cybersecurity framework:</p>

<p>This chapter focused on knowledge check, particularly related to certifications. There are many eLearning platforms that have opened and all offer competitive courses and certifications upon the successful completion of each course.</p>
<p>Certifications will offer learners some advantages in the job market that applicants that only have degrees will not get. Certifications show employers that you take initiative, show that you are highly skilled in a certain niche, equip you with in-demand skills, market your skills, and can kickstart a cyber security career for people with non-IT degrees. Choosing the certification to take and the vendor must always be done with caution. Before picking a course, you should evaluate the vendor's reputation, the credibility of the certification, the duration of the course, the feedback from previous learners, the level of support that learners are offered, and market demand.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, we will explore the various aspects of security-intelligence resources that can be publicly and commercially consumed to enhance organizational security.</p>
