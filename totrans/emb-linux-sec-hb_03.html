			<h1 id="_idParaDest-48"><a id="_idTextAnchor100"/>Applying Design Requirements Criteria – Hardware Selection</h1>&#13;
			<p>In this chapter, we’ll be performing a deep introspective into the design criteria that will determine what hardware you select. The simple decision of selecting a platform alone could drive thousands of other dependencies you may not have even thought of previously. This chapter and the next (which is this chapter’s companion) will become the cornerstone of all future efforts when you’re building your appliance.</p>&#13;
			<p>Additionally, It’s my understanding that if you’re reading this book (which I deeply appreciate you choosing by the way!), you’re somewhat vested in its core subject matter. As the author, I’m assuming that not only are you interested in <strong class="bold">embedded Linux systems</strong> but that<a id="_idIndexMarker116"/> you are probably deeply involved in such a project right now. Knowing that, I assume that you also have a good baseline of general technical knowledge. I trust that the level of the information presented here is informative enough to add value to your project and not too general enough to be an affront to your already acquired skills. This chapter and the next are meant to help you connect all the metaphorical dots and illuminate a greater picture of what your solution can become.</p>&#13;
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>&#13;
			<p class="callout">If you’re planning to <a id="_idIndexMarker117"/>build a <strong class="bold">virtual appliance</strong>, this chapter may not be as relevant for you and your team as we will be focusing on hardware. This chapter is mostly geared toward the physical. We will only briefly review virtual appliances. In terms of virtual appliances (or cloud offerings), you’ll need to consider what platform(s) you need to create images for. In recent years, virtual appliances have become more and more prevalent, especially in<a id="_idIndexMarker118"/> terms of the app stores on any of the <strong class="bold">hyperscalers</strong> (Azure, AWS, or Google). Many still build virtual appliances for OpenStack, KVM, Hyper-V, and (mostly) VMware ESXi.</p>&#13;
			<p>Whether you choose to make your products physical, virtual, or both, this chapter will help you and your design team sort out all the criteria to make an appropriate hardware platform selection. Additionally, we’ll review how best practices can impact these selections in terms of performance and scalability. These best practices tie in directly to your security footprint but they’ll also assist you in building a better product.</p>&#13;
			<p>In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>What are the targeted performance requirements?</li>&#13;
				<li>Are there any environmental limitations?</li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Common off-the-shelf</strong> (<strong class="bold">COTS</strong>) versus custom-built hardware</li>&#13;
				<li>What mainstream hardware platforms are available?</li>&#13;
				<li>Hardware and use case criteria will dictate your operating system selection</li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>Let’s get starte<a id="_idTextAnchor101"/>d.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-49"><a id="_idTextAnchor102"/>What are the targeted performance requirements?</h1>&#13;
			<p>At this point, it’s time<a id="_idIndexMarker119"/> for us to get technical. Hopefully, the developers of your solution have at least a general idea of what the end-state requirements of the appliance will be. Not having this crucial information at your disposal may make your prototyping exercises rather expensive as you may have to test multiple iterations of hardware platforms.</p>&#13;
			<p>Regardless of the size and scale of your solution, or whether it’s physical or virtual, you must ensure that extensive performance testing is conducted to ensure that the security measures that are implemented within it still allow the solution to perform its tasks as advertised. We’ll get into how to integrate these security measures in later chapters.</p>&#13;
			<p>Another critical thing to consider is the future state of your solution. Ensure that the specifications you set forth for the applications, security measures, and scale of user data have some level of a safety buffer. It’s impossible to plan for the performance impact of future security patches or changes in your applications over time. Giving your solution a little extra CPU, memory, and storage can save your support team a trunk full of grief in the future.</p>&#13;
			<p>For now, let’s learn what we need if we decide so that we can create our solution virtual<a id="_idTextAnchor103"/>ly.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-50"><a id="_idTextAnchor104"/>Virtual appliances</h2>&#13;
			<p>If you plan to<a id="_idIndexMarker120"/> deliver your offering as a virtual appliance, this exercise is going to be far less stressful. You won’t be testing hardware! You don’t need to worry about procuring a platform that meets your life cycle needs. It’s liberating. Deciding on creating a virtual appliance (or a public cloud offering) puts the resource requirements on the customer.</p>&#13;
			<p>Your customer can then decide exactly how much vCPU, RAM, storage, and networking bandwidth they wish to assign to the virtual appliance. They provide the platform. The added benefit of this is that you know that the operating system that you need to choose must support Intel/AMD as that is the general standard in the enterprise. Your company, of course, can make recommendations for those baselines. In terms of public cloud providers, you can set the baseline VM sizing as part of the marketplace offering.</p>&#13;
			<p>At this point, the key decision becomes which virtualization platforms you’re planning to make your solution available for – VMware, OpenStack, KVM, Hyper-V, Google, Azure, or AWS. Initially, you may start with one platform and then decide to add platforms as it is feasible for your teams.</p>&#13;
			<p>I would be remiss in not mentioning that a good product manager does their research into which is the best selection for platforming. Depending on said research, you may find division in your target user base and their preferences, their procurement cycles, and, most importantly, their preferences for cloud and/or on-premises virtualization platforms.</p>&#13;
			<p>Although many solutions cannot be delivered as a virtual appliance, if it is feasible for your product, I’d recommend giving that methodology strong consideration. There’s a wealth of flexibility it can offer, something we will cover later in this book.</p>&#13;
			<p>Now that we’ve covered the performance of physical appliances, let’s consider hardware des<a id="_idTextAnchor105"/>ign.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-51"><a id="_idTextAnchor106"/>T-shirt sizing</h2>&#13;
			<p><strong class="bold">T-shirt sizing</strong> is a <a id="_idIndexMarker121"/>method of scaling and delivering a solution based on a desired capacity. It’s meant to standardize and simplify the delivery of your solution to your end-customer at the scales most commonly sought after.</p>&#13;
			<p>Allow me to present an example to help describe the T-shirt sizing methodology. For discussion’s sake, let’s say that a company wants to deliver a standalone storage solution. This company plans to offer a small, medium, and large solution. It becomes quite clear why they call it T-shirt sizing.</p>&#13;
			<p>They decide that the small version of the solution will have the following hardware attributes:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>Single multi-core CPU (with low core counts)</li>&#13;
				<li>32 GB of RAM</li>&#13;
				<li>Dual-gigabit Ethernet interfaces</li>&#13;
				<li>4x 1 TB SATA SSD drives</li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>Moving on to <a id="_idIndexMarker122"/>their next level, they have decided that the medium version of their storage solution has the following hardware attributes:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>Single multi-core CPU (with high core counts)</li>&#13;
				<li>64 GB of RAM</li>&#13;
				<li>Four-gigabit Ethernet interfaces</li>&#13;
				<li>8x 1 TB SATA SSD drives</li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>Closing the loop on their sizing, they have decided that the large version of their storage appliance has the following hardware attributes:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>Dual multi-core CPUs (with high core counts)</li>&#13;
				<li>128 GB of RAM</li>&#13;
				<li>Four-gigabit Ethernet interfaces</li>&#13;
				<li>Dual 10G Ethernet interfaces</li>&#13;
				<li>16x 1 TB SATA SSD drives</li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>These examples have been simplified to illustrate a point. The fictitious company selected three levels, each one being a larger scale than the previous. In the physical appliance world, this sizing methodology will also imply that to create a T-shirt-sized offering, much more work will be needed to ensure each release of the solution delivers the expected <a id="_idIndexMarker123"/>performance and security levels consistently. It is not uncommon that the choice to create such stepped-sized offerings may force the usage of different hardware vendors and platforms altogether.</p>&#13;
			<p>T-shirt sizing your solutions invokes additional work for your teams, but I argue that it is a great methodology to consider. Doing such allows you to deliver your solution to a wider range of audiences with different scales of need. Now that we’ve reviewed the impact scaling has on design, let’s look at other factors in the hardware<a id="_idTextAnchor107"/> realm.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-52"><a id="_idTextAnchor108"/>CPU/VCPU</h2>&#13;
			<p>The CPU is the<a id="_idIndexMarker124"/> single greatest determining factor of everything else in your solution. There is a broad range in terms of performance, power consumption, and price. Your solutions’ form factor, environmental thresholds, and performance needs will ultimately drive the decision.</p>&#13;
			<p>Before we get into all the greatness each CPU family brings to the table, I want you to know about the dark side of this equation. That’s right – I’m starting with the bad news and hopefully ending on a positive note in these next few sections. As this is a security-focused book, we must dive deep into the limitations, vulnerabilities, exploitation of said weaknesses, and other general malfeasance that becomes possible when choosing the wrong platform.</p>&#13;
			<p>Later in this book, we’ll dive into all the resources your teams will have available to inform you of new threats, vulnerabilities, fixes, and mitigations. For now, let’s just go to the swampy waters of what to avoid today. The following list is <a id="_idIndexMarker125"/>based on entries in the <strong class="bold">Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures</strong> (<strong class="bold">CVE</strong>) database.</p>&#13;
			<p>It’s worth noting that the nasty ones get named, but not friendly human names such as tropical storms, hurricanes, and typhoons. They get names that instill the doom and gloom in those that mention them. Often, the team that discovers the vulnerability will give the vulnerability a logo as well.</p>&#13;
			<p>As there are currently about 240,000 known vulnerabilities of all types in the CVE database, I will only review some of those that grabbed headlines worldwide. This list will get you started, but don’t stop here – continue your research before making a selection. The following list highlights some of the most impactful CVEs that should influence your CPU and<a id="_idIndexMarker126"/> platform due diligence. We will also look at their impacts and mitigation t<a id="_idTextAnchor109"/>echniques:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Meltdown</strong>: This<a id="_idIndexMarker127"/> family of vulnerabilities, which is contained in multiple CVEs, is centered upon the ability to exploit a race condition in the CPU and gain access to privileged information. It has 5 CVEs – CVE-2023-46836, CVE-2022-42331, CVE-2018-7112, CVE-2018-19965, and CVE-2017-5754:<ul><li><strong class="bold">Impacts</strong>: Intel x86 microprocessors, AMD microprocessors, IBM Power processors, and some ARM microprocessors.</li><li><strong class="bold">Mitigations</strong>: Most operating systems vendors have created patches to mitigate the vulnerability, but there are serious performance impacts on the systems once these fixes are applied. Newer processors built after 2019 should have hardware and firmware mitigations built in but still, there are new transient execution CPU vulnerabilities as recent as 2023.</li></ul></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Spectre</strong>: This<a id="_idIndexMarker128"/> family of vulnerabilities, which is contained in many CVEs, is very similar to Meltdown in terms of how CPU conditions are exploited to attain privileged information access by unauthorized users. It has 31 CVEs, so I’ll highlight the most important two – CVE-2017-5753 &amp; CVE-2017-5715:<ul><li><strong class="bold">Impacts</strong>: Intel x86 microprocessors, as well as AMD and ARM microprocessors.</li><li><strong class="bold">Mitigations</strong>: Most operating systems vendors have created patches to mitigate this vulnerability, but there are serious performance impacts on these systems once these fixes are applied. Newer processors built after 2019 should have hardware and firmware mitigations built in but still, there are new transient execution CPU vulnerabilities as recent as 2023.</li></ul></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Downfall</strong>: Also known <a id="_idIndexMarker129"/>as <strong class="bold">Gather Data Sampling</strong> (<strong class="bold">GDS</strong>), Downfall<a id="_idIndexMarker130"/> is another breed of transient execution CPU vulnerability that attacks the speculative execution functions in the CPU called <strong class="bold">Advanced Vector Extensions</strong> (<strong class="bold">AVX</strong>). Through this weakness, it is possible to run an exploit to access data contained within the vector registers (CVE-2022-40982):<ul><li><strong class="bold">Impacts</strong>: Intel X86-64 consumer microprocessors of product generations 6 through 11, Intel Xeon X86-64 processors of generations 1 through 4.</li><li><strong class="bold">Mitigations</strong>: It is expected that version 6.5 or greater of the Linux kernel will have code to mitigate this. However, even in 2024, almost every consumer computer today is vulnerable to it.</li></ul></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Foreshadow</strong>: This <a id="_idIndexMarker131"/>vulnerability is <a id="_idIndexMarker132"/>also known as <strong class="bold">L1 Terminal Fault</strong> (<strong class="bold">L1TF</strong>). It targets virtual <a id="_idIndexMarker133"/>machines, hypervisors, and then ultimately the operating systems involved by attacking memory management (CVEs: CVE-2018-3615 &amp; CVE-2018-3620):<ul><li><strong class="bold">Impacts</strong>: Virtually all families of Intel and AMD microprocessors.</li><li><strong class="bold">Mitigations</strong>: Processor replacement appears to be the best fix to resolve the problem. This issue has been resolved within the Intel Xeon processor family, starting with the Cascade Lake release. All newer chipsets should be immune to the exploits.</li></ul></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Inception</strong>: This vulnerability, also<a id="_idIndexMarker134"/> known as <strong class="bold">Return Address Security</strong> (<strong class="bold">RAS</strong>), is a new<a id="_idIndexMarker135"/> type of side-channel attack that targets speculative execution (CVE-2023-20569):<ul><li><strong class="bold">Impacts</strong>: Virtually all recent AMD microprocessors.</li><li><strong class="bold">Mitigations</strong>: AMD has released BIOS and firmware patch bundles to mitigate this exploit. Additionally, operating systems vendors may have released workaround patches. As of February 28, 2024, AMD has updated its published whitepaper with new information on how to mitigate this attack on future AMD processors (<a href="https://www.amd.com/content/dam/amd/en/documents/corporate/cr/speculative-return-stack-overflow-whitepaper.pdf">https://www.amd.com/content/dam/amd/en/documents/corporate/cr/speculative-return-stack-overflow-whitepaper.pdf</a>).</li></ul></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>This list was my version of the top five exploitable vulnerabilities to be actively aware of. Each is generally tied to multiple CVEs and not all have been mitigated to the fullest extent. New variations or similar attacks continue to plague all CPU platforms as threats and AI usage to find new vulnerabilities evolve.</p>&#13;
			<p>Fueled with that baseline information, you can see how hardware selection impacts your security footprint. As we move on to the next section, remember that all of these factors will resurface when we discuss operating system selection in the next chapter. For now, we’ll look into various mem<a id="_idTextAnchor110"/>ory considerations.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-53"><a id="_idTextAnchor111"/>Memory</h2>&#13;
			<p>Memory type is<a id="_idIndexMarker136"/> deeply tied to the CPU and its associated memory controllers. These are all unchangeable parts of the system’s main board or motherboard. Because of the inferred dependencies, this is one of the easier selection points. However, from a security and reliability perspective, there are some differences to consider when making design choices. Each of these factors has a cost and other implications.</p>&#13;
			<p>In my experience, the <a id="_idIndexMarker137"/>only questionable option that you may be forced to consider is utilizing <strong class="bold">Error-Correcting Code RAM</strong> (<strong class="bold">ECC RAM</strong>) or non-ECC RAM.</p>&#13;
			<p>What is ECC RAM? It is fault-tolerant memory that’s primarily used in high-end servers and workstations. Although it does provide greater resiliency, there can be a mild performance degradation in using this. If you need resilience, chances are that a ~2% hit to speed doesn’t matter.</p>&#13;
			<p>Due to its higher cost than standard RAM modules, ECC RAM is uncommonly found in IoT devices or small-scale embedded Linux systems.</p>&#13;
			<p>Next, we’ll consider a more important factor that can be impacted by you<a id="_idTextAnchor112"/>r security footprint.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-54"><a id="_idTextAnchor113"/>Disk input/output (I/O)</h2>&#13;
			<p>To<a id="_idIndexMarker138"/> best understand how this can impact your design, you must know the definition of the term <strong class="bold">input/output operations per second</strong> (<strong class="bold">IOPS</strong>). Since the point of this book is security, not <a id="_idIndexMarker139"/>teaching technical terms, I thought it appropriate to leverage a standard, publicly accepted definition here.</p>&#13;
			<p>IOPS is defined as “<em class="italic">an input/output performance measurement that’s used to characterize computer storage devices such as hard disk drives (HDDs), solid-state drives (SSDs), and storage area networks (SANs). Like benchmarks, IOPS numbers published by storage device manufacturers do not directly relate to real-world </em><em class="italic">application performance.</em>”</p>&#13;
			<p class="callout-heading">Tip</p>&#13;
			<p class="callout">For vastly more on this subject, visit the Wikipedia page on this: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOPS">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOPS</a>. Wikipedia is an invaluable public resource that you should consider donating to if it helps you. It sure has helped me over the years.</p>&#13;
			<p>Secondly, you <a id="_idIndexMarker140"/>must understand the impact encryption has on system performance in terms of overhead and degraded IOPS.</p>&#13;
			<p>The third and final factor to be considered is what type of storage your solution will leverage. This still matters regardless of whether you are creating a virtual appliance or a physical one. The painful difference between the two delivery methods is that you can control what storage types are built into a physical appliance, whereas with a virtual appliance, you have no control and can only provide recommendations. If the end-user can control what storage class is used, your solution may not function as advertised or – even worse – not be able to function at all if the storage is too slow to meet the applications’ needs. So, let’s look at what storage choices there are.</p>&#13;
			<p>In the following storage classification list, I will be focusing on the base unit of storage itself and not going into different mass storage options, such as arrays or network-attached storage. That could be a whole book in itself. So, let’s look at your options for individual storage drives:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Hard disk drive</strong> (<strong class="bold">HDD</strong>) is one <a id="_idIndexMarker141"/>of the oldest storage devices for computer systems. Over the decades, the size of the spinning magnetic platters has greatly shrunk in size but gained in terms of storage capacity. Early HDDs had their capacity in megabytes, though today, they can contain as much as several terabytes. Other factors that will limit the overall performance of this storage platform are the bus that connects the drive and the amount of IOPS:<ul><li><strong class="bold">Bus</strong>: SATA</li><li><strong class="bold">IOPS</strong>: Between 50-80 on average</li></ul></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p class="callout-heading">Tip</p>&#13;
			<p class="callout">The bus and IOPS are provided for all noted storage platforms.</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Solid state drive</strong> (<strong class="bold">SSD</strong>) is a <a id="_idIndexMarker142"/>leap forward in storage technology from HDD disks. SSDs have no moving parts and are created in very small form factors. They are generally delivered in the form factor of a 2.5 in disk or card form:<ul><li><strong class="bold">Bus</strong>: SATA or PCIe</li><li><strong class="bold">IOPS</strong>: Depending on the platform, 4,000 to tens of thousands (or more)</li></ul></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Non-Volatile Memory Express</strong> (<strong class="bold">NVME</strong>) is the latest in consumer storage platforms. NVME <a id="_idIndexMarker143"/>drives are delivered as small cards. Sometimes, multiple NVME drive cards can be mounted onto a larger PCIe card for storage density:<ul><li><strong class="bold">Bus</strong>: PCIe</li><li><strong class="bold">IOPS</strong>: Depending on the platform, 10,000 up to millions</li></ul></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>Now that <a id="_idIndexMarker144"/>we’ve taken a deep dive into some of the most common storage types, let’s look at how adding encryption impacts their performance.</p>&#13;
			<p>Encryption at the disk, volume, or filesystem level can easily be broken down into two delivery methods. These are hardware-based encryption and software-based encryption. Each has its positives and negatives.</p>&#13;
			<p>Hardware-based solutions are normally delivered via PCIe RAID cards. They can not only allow you to create resilient volumes but also offload the overhead of providing encryption from the main CPU or operating system. The only drawbacks are having proper slots to fit the cards into your solution, and more so the costs of said cards.</p>&#13;
			<p><strong class="bold">Linux Unified Key Setup</strong> (<strong class="bold">LUKS</strong>) is the <a id="_idIndexMarker145"/>standard software-based encryption method for Linux distributions. Widely used across the world in solutions of all scales, LUKS does add a bit of overhead cost in terms of RAM and CPU performance. On scale, it requires external key management, but on an individual system, it will force the user to enter a passphrase before the filesystem can be accessed. This can be cumbersome for booting and updating processes as it requires manual intervention. Other than those factors, it costs nothing to implement.</p>&#13;
			<p>Encrypting data at rest is considered a cornerstone of systems security. On the other hand, encrypting data in transit is often taken care of at the app<a id="_idTextAnchor114"/>lication or networking layer.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-55"><a id="_idTextAnchor115"/>Networking</h2>&#13;
			<p>In this <a id="_idIndexMarker146"/>section, we’ll review a few options you can implement to add security to your networking profile while reducing the load on your solution’s CPU. With each of these options, we’ll provide you with some links to further educate you on their technology. Each of these technologies, which will be presented in brevity here, can greatly assist your team in designing a more secure solution.</p>&#13;
			<p>What I don’t want to do here is waste your time with general information on firewalling, VLANs, whitelisting address segments, or other basic network security. As this book focuses on designing, building, and supporting secure embedded Linux systems appliances, I intend to highlight hardware that can assist you. Let’s take a look at a couple of interesting technologies that you should conside<a id="_idTextAnchor116"/>r putting into your solutions.</p>&#13;
			<h3>TCP offload engine</h3>&#13;
			<p>For several<a id="_idIndexMarker147"/> years now, some higher-end <strong class="bold">network interface cards</strong> (<strong class="bold">NICs</strong>) have<a id="_idIndexMarker148"/> had additional built-in functionality to offload the entire TCP/IP networking stack from the main CPU of the system. This comes in the form of a solution known as a <strong class="bold">TCP offload engine</strong>. These<a id="_idIndexMarker149"/> NICs are supported by virtually all operating systems now.</p>&#13;
			<p>Leveraging one or more of these cards can improve the performance of your solution but realistically, you must still have to account for encryption and security in your applications and systems configuration as well. Moving the networking stack to the NIC allows for other types of application security to run unimpeded on the main CPU.</p>&#13;
			<p>You can learn more about this technology at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP_offload_engine">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP_offload_engine</a>.</p>&#13;
			<h3>TLS accelerator cards</h3>&#13;
			<p><strong class="bold">Transport Layer Security</strong> (<strong class="bold">TLS</strong>) accelerators (formerly also known as <strong class="bold">SSL accelerators</strong>) are cards <a id="_idIndexMarker150"/>that<a id="_idIndexMarker151"/> offload processor-intensive work related to encrypting and decrypting network traffic. The performance boost and network security capability increase by leveraging one of these solutions is beyond substantial. Some high-end appliance manufacturers embed this hardware <a id="_idIndexMarker152"/>directly on their mainboards, though they can be added easily via a PCI slot (if available) on the system.</p>&#13;
			<p>You can learn more about this technology at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TLS_acceleration">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TLS_acceleration</a>.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-56"><a id="_idTextAnchor119"/>GPU</h2>&#13;
			<p>OK – I know that I may<a id="_idIndexMarker153"/> ruffle some feathers here with<a id="_idIndexMarker154"/> my take on this subject. In recent years, GPUs have been used more for offloading workloads than processing video output in many appliance solutions worldwide. It can be debated and argued that most modern GPUs are more competent at workload processing than the majority of the mainstream CPU market.</p>&#13;
			<p>Regardless of your opinion on their usage, offloading the processing of computational power to GPUs is a <a id="_idIndexMarker155"/>mainstream function in many Linux systems. This is most commonly associated with<a id="_idIndexMarker156"/> efforts in <strong class="bold">artificial intelligence</strong> (<strong class="bold">AI</strong>) and <strong class="bold">machine learning</strong> (<strong class="bold">ML</strong>) applications.</p>&#13;
			<p>This is a design concern based on what may be supported in your chosen operating system (which we plan to dive deep into within the next chapter). Adding a GPU to your system is no small decision. Most of these cards are quite significant in terms of size and they require a notable amount<a id="_idIndexMarker157"/> of additional power (provided via direct cables from the <strong class="bold">power supply unit</strong> (<strong class="bold">PSU</strong>) of the system itself). In most circumstances, this additional power powers the card’s cooling fans as they generate heat like an oven!</p>&#13;
			<p>Implementing a solution that requires a significant GPU or multiple GPUs will require a larger PSU and more significant cooling to be built within the appliance. I felt that it was important to mention this as we will soon discuss the impact environmental concerns have on your solution.</p>&#13;
			<p>Next, we’ll consider other custom hardwar<a id="_idTextAnchor120"/>e that you may require in your appliance.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-57"><a id="_idTextAnchor121"/>Custom hardware and peripherals</h2>&#13;
			<p>This is a<a id="_idIndexMarker158"/> section that may be near and dear to your heart since you’re building a custom solution. There are vast security implications and factors to consider, depending on what your solution will be connected to or contain internally. Building an appliance solution virtually implies some level of customization at not just the software level but the hardware leveraged as well. This is best described by the fact that you are solving an issue or several issues that the end-customer could not account for easily.</p>&#13;
			<p>Physical security concerns aside, let’s take a journey down the path of what security concerns may exist with the usage of custom hardware and/or external peripheral hardware devices. These can be internal or connected to your solution externally. They may require your solution to have third-party drivers and software installed that you have little control over or input in their life cycle.</p>&#13;
			<p>For externally connected devices, the concern not only resides in software that is out of your control but also in the physical medium to which your solution is connected to these devices. Perhaps your solution is built to control or maintain external industrial machines. The very manner in which your solution connects with them and the protocols in play is the greatest security concern.</p>&#13;
			<p>If the custom hardware or peripheral needs third-party support and software, your team must ensure that the life cycle and support cycle will align with what you project for your solution. If you’re building a solution that’s anticipated to last for approximately 5-10 years but the third-party software needed to maintain the functionality may not be supported after only a few years, there is a massive gap. Failure to plan for this is a security problem. If there’s a newly discovered vulnerability but your vendor is no longer providing support or updates, your solution is ultimately compromised.</p>&#13;
			<p>The<a id="_idIndexMarker159"/> implications for your product might be substantial here, so I recommend having done a bit of due diligence in confirming the supportability of anything third party that you build into your solution. <em class="italic">The devil is in </em><em class="italic">the details</em>.</p>&#13;
			<p>Now, let’s move on to another crucial factor – encompassing the implications of how and where your solution may be deployed by your end-customers. This <a id="_idTextAnchor122"/>is the environment in which it will reside.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-58"><a id="_idTextAnchor123"/>Are there any environmental limitations?</h1>&#13;
			<p>In this section, we will cover a group of often overlapping concerns that will impact the design and physical security of your product. Not all hardware is capable of residing in challenging environments. Let’s face the facts here and acknowledge that most electronics need a pretty stable and safe environment in which to operate efficiently. Exposure to the elements, limited cooling, power availability, lack of internet, and physical security all are at play here (and more). These factors may greatly influence whether or not your team can leverage existing off-the-shelf hardware platforms or whether you must design and build a custom platform. There are many vendors worldwide that can assist you regardless, but it’s up to you and your team to make that call. L<a id="_idTextAnchor124"/>et’s look at the factors you must consider.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-59"><a id="_idTextAnchor125"/>Power</h2>&#13;
			<p>Power consumption, which<a id="_idIndexMarker160"/> is directly correlated to cooling requirements, is yet another crucial calculation and requirement for your solution. Power consumption is rate-limited by the power supply in the hardware platform. These can vary vastly, depending on the scale of capacity and the components in your solution.</p>&#13;
			<p>Another power consideration has to do with where and how it will be deployed. Let’s review some examples.</p>&#13;
			<p>The average CPU doesn’t consume that much power. However, if you have built a solution that has incorporated one or more GPUs, then plan for additional power and aggressive amounts of cooling. This may entail additional components, such as additional fans, liquid cooling systems, or additional heat sinks.</p>&#13;
			<p>Systems <a id="_idIndexMarker161"/>that run too hot don’t live long productive lives. They are much more likely to crash randomly and create situations where your solution is compromised or create negative customer experience issues. Heat is a key environmental factor. We will revisit environmental considerations later in this chapter and also discuss how some vendors counter them.</p>&#13;
			<p>Let’s<a id="_idTextAnchor126"/> move on to another set of impacting factors.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-60"><a id="_idTextAnchor127"/>Offline/air-gapped</h2>&#13;
			<p>Albeit very <a id="_idIndexMarker162"/>common for embedded Linux systems appliances, being cut off from the internet is not a bad thing. Being shielded from exposure to external threats can be seen as a positive attribute for a system to have. Sadly, such protection also comes at a cost. Simplistic methods to provide device updates directly from web-based resources become untenable.</p>&#13;
			<p>These systems require additional coding for their interfaces and alternate methods for processing software updates. This can be as simple as creating a DNF repository behind the firewall for the devices to update or be as complex as having an interface that leverages the ingestion of an update via an encrypted tarball, ISO image, or binary file.</p>&#13;
			<p>It’s paramount for you to understand your target market so that you can plan for this requirement. For some industries, such as the government, this is considered a baseline standard to adhere to. However, there are exceptions, hence why we covered impact levels earlier in this book. Some agencies may allow systems that are not critical nor contain any sensitive data to get their updates from the internet. It happens, but this cannot be assumed to be the standard. Often, the standards are much less forgiving.</p>&#13;
			<p>What if your appliance is a component in a vehicle? Let’s just assume this vehicle itself has no internet access and that its updates are only provided when the vehicles’ owners take them to the dealership for service. Sound futuristic? Not exactly. This situation is a reality today. In terms of some of the most advanced vehicles, maybe they can self-update when they are parked outside your home via your Wi-Fi connection. Some even have satellite connections. Can you see where this leads? But mostly, such updates are strictly controlled by the manufacturers. I honestly believe they’d prefer to be able to charge you money via the dealership for such services.</p>&#13;
			<p>Many<a id="_idIndexMarker163"/> appliances are deployed in areas that simply have no luxury of getting connected to a cellular network, Wi-Fi, or LAN. So, simply knowing your target audience and planning to serve them best is key.</p>&#13;
			<p>We’ll talk more about this subject in upcoming chapters and dive deeper into this via practical exercises in future chapters (in which you’ll also have access to the resources via this book’s GitHub repository).</p>&#13;
			<p>I could go on about offline systems. I bet you’re thinking, <em class="italic">Please don’t!</em>. So, for now, let’s move on t<a id="_idTextAnchor128"/>o the next critical factor we need to plan for.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-61"><a id="_idTextAnchor129"/>Climate control</h2>&#13;
			<p>Where exactly <a id="_idIndexMarker164"/>will your solution be deployed? This is yet another key bit of information. Why? Brace for impact, because it truly matters. If your target audience works in a desert environment outdoors, for example, then standard off-the-shelf hardware will not suffice. You’ll need hardware that can survive in that environment and thrive. Such an example poses other system design concerns. Will this system be in sunlight and be exposed to the elements?</p>&#13;
			<p>Hopefully, you can see where I am going with this. But if you can’t yet, let’s take a look at another example situation. Let’s say that your appliance is targeting the agricultural industry and that it is mounted on very large tractors that service massive farmlands. Is your solution going to be able to withstand the vast differences in temperatures, humidity, and weather in that situation?</p>&#13;
			<p>Now, let’s consider the ultimate extreme example that has existed for decades. What if your solution were to be a component of something traveling in outer space, such as a satellite or a deep space probe? Is your solution capable of enduring radiation, vast heating and freezing situations, and most of all the prospect of a piece of space dust or debris traveling at 100,000 km per hour?</p>&#13;
			<p>Environmental conditions can easily compromise your solution if they are not planned for. However, there’s also another level of security you need to plan for if a machine is not in a protected location: the appliance’s physical security. Few platforms have tamper-proofing built in, so this also needs to be considered if your solution could be in a place outside or exposed to the public. Perhaps you need to ensure the solution has a locking enclosure or other protections.</p>&#13;
			<p>Protect your solutions from their target environment. Protect your solutions from unauthorized access. Protect your solutions from the end-users themselves. Yes, I said it – protect your appliances from the end-users themselves. The overall environment in which your<a id="_idIndexMarker165"/> solutions could be deployed determines our next design factor. Taking all, you’ve gathered thus far, let’s move on to choosing to use off-the-shelf hardware or having something custom-built.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-62"><a id="_idTextAnchor130"/>COTS versus custom-built hardware</h1>&#13;
			<p>Yes, I <a id="_idIndexMarker166"/>saved this <em class="italic">little</em> section for last in this group as all the previous ones led to this. This is where I truly hope that you’ve been paying close attention to the treasure trove of circumstances that can impact your overall final design for your solution.</p>&#13;
			<p>As part of my intense research for this book, I’ve reached out to a few of the most likely hardware vendors that impact the embedded Linux systems market here in North America and globally. I was shocked to see how several of them no longer offer fully customized solutions rather than custom bezels and covers, hence why I felt this review needed to be here.</p>&#13;
			<p>Some smaller or foreign shops will build you a system to specification but know that you will pay a premium for such services. I humbly acknowledge that based on your solutions’ needs, this may be your only recourse.</p>&#13;
			<p>Some of these global vendors, such as Dell, HPE, and Lenovo, are more than happy to create a rebranded version of the hardware they already build. Few, however, at least in the USA, will build a custom system from the motherboard up. Those that will create an entire custom build from the motherboard onwards will not be inexpensive unless the order of scale in the number of systems requested is astronomical.</p>&#13;
			<p>As customization is at such a premium cost, leveraging an existing form factor/build from a major vendor does have its advantages. Firstly, you know the system that will be delivered to you is supported, has a level of quality, and is easily repeated. The bigger factor in leveraging a vendor like this is to be able to get a system that meets your environmental and form factor needs.</p>&#13;
			<p>In this section, we’ll take a look at a couple of global companies that build good systems that can be leveraged as your platform for your embedded Linux system. My day job has empowered me with excellent access to these two companies (and several others) but I offer the disclaimer that there are more out there across the globe. Both have many excellent products and services that can assist your team in its journey to create the ultimate secure embedded Linux system.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-63"><a id="_idTextAnchor131"/>Dell</h2>&#13;
			<p>So, who is <a id="_idIndexMarker167"/>Dell and what do they do in the embedded Linux systems space? As one of the largest OEM manufacturers of technology solutions in the world, Dell has advanced capabilities and services that can be tailored to assist their embedded partners in logistics, building, and providing key solutions’ life cycle services. In other words, they can help you build, design, and then actually do all the heavy lifting for your team. This means that once you’ve settled on a design specification, Dell’s services can build, ship to customers, and even provide end-customer updates and support. You can learn more at <a href="http://www.dell.com">www.dell.com</a> or on YouTube at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC01FW5V9UVohbPtqKSmXX-w">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC01FW5V9UVohbPtqKSmXX-w</a>.</p>&#13;
			<p>Dell makes a wide range of server and workstation products. Another thing that Dell is known for is being one of the world’s first major OEM vendors to ship Linux pre-installed on their systems.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-64"><a id="_idTextAnchor132"/>OnLogic™</h2>&#13;
			<p>So, who is<a id="_idIndexMarker168"/> OnLogic™ and what do they do in the embedded Linux systems space? As mentioned on the official website (<a href="https://www.OnLogic.com/company/press/cl250/">https://www.OnLogic.com/company/press/cl250/</a>), <em class="italic">“OnLogic™ is a global industrial computer manufacturer who designs highly configurable, solution-focused computers engineered for reliability at the IoT edge.

Any of these systems are geared toward a wide range of environmental conditions. These resilient systems empower operations in climates and situations that would destroy lesser systems.</p>&#13;
			<p>Let’s consider an example of an OnLogic system being used in an industrial situation. The following figure shows an ARM-based OnLogic Factor 201™ system mounted in an electrical <a id="_idIndexMarker169"/>cabinet and <a id="_idIndexMarker170"/>being used as a <strong class="bold">programmable logic controller</strong> (<strong class="bold">PLC</strong>) that controls functions for machine controls within a factory environment:</p>&#13;

			<p>Now that we’ve reviewed a couple of examples of COTS systems, if you don’t believe they meet your needs, then it’s time to consider custom builds from the ground up. This is a herculean undertaking an<a id="_idTextAnchor133"/>d not something I have any deep recommendations for.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-65"><a id="_idTextAnchor134"/>What mainstream CPU/hardware platforms are available?</h1>&#13;
			<p>Now, let’s take a quick tour of the most commonplace platforms (and some not-so-common) that can be found being used by companies building embedded Linux systems. Each of these platforms has a unique performance profile and costs. The following platforms have been used by partners that I have worked with in the past decade. Some of these <a id="_idTextAnchor135"/>are vastly more popular than others. Let’s dive in.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-66"><a id="_idTextAnchor136"/>Xeon™</h2>&#13;
			<p>The Intel <a id="_idIndexMarker171"/>Xeon™ processor family <a id="_idIndexMarker172"/>has been the flagship of high-performance server and workstation solutions since its introduction in 1998. These processors are commonly used in AI, HPC, database and analytics, and critical application workloads.</p>&#13;
			<p>For more information on choosing the right Xeon processor for your solution, visit the Intel® website at <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/docs/processors/xeon/server-processor-overview.html">https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/docs/processors/xeon/server-processor-overview.html</a>.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-67"><a id="_idTextAnchor137"/>Core™</h2>&#13;
			<p>The Intel® Core™ <a id="_idIndexMarker173"/>family of processors covers a wide range of devices, from<a id="_idIndexMarker174"/> IoT devices to laptops to the highest-end gaming PCs (i3, i5, i7, and i9). This family of processors can effortlessly handle everything from edge computing to business applications to high-end gaming.</p>&#13;
			<p>For more information on how to choose the right Core processor for your solution, visit the Intel website at <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/details/processors/core.html">https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/details/processors/core.html</a>.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-68"><a id="_idTextAnchor139"/>Atom™</h2>&#13;
			<p>The<a id="_idIndexMarker175"/> Intel® Atom™ family<a id="_idIndexMarker176"/> of processors delivers a low-power consuming x64 platform that’s geared toward appliances and IoT devices. You might even think that these processors were tailor-made for the diverse environmental needs of most networking devices, edge appliances, and definitely for embedded Linux systems solutions. Don’t let their lightweight size and reduced power<a id="_idIndexMarker177"/> consumption fool you – these processors pack a punch in terms of processing capability. To learn <a id="_idIndexMarker178"/>more about Atom processors, visit the Intel website at <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/details/processors/atom.html">https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/details/processors/atom.html</a>.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-69"><a id="_idTextAnchor141"/>Ryzen™</h2>&#13;
			<p>The <a id="_idIndexMarker179"/>AMD® Ryzen™ family of <a id="_idIndexMarker180"/>processors boasts onboard AI capabilities and Radeon GPU features on-chip. This empowers these chipsets to not just address the gaming PC market but readily provide the ability to process AI workloads within small form factors. AMD is also committed to maintaining the socket technology used by this family of processors for years to come. This is a pretty cool feature if you wish to future-proof your solution or be able to simply change the CPU itself for T-shirt sizing options. To learn more about the Ryzen™ family of processors, vi<a id="_idTextAnchor142"/>sit the AMD website at <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/products/processors/business-systems/ryzen-ai.html">https://www.amd.com/en/products/processors/business-systems/ryzen-ai.html</a>.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-70"><a id="_idTextAnchor143"/>Advanced RISC Machine (ARM™)</h2>&#13;
			<p><strong class="bold">ARM®</strong> isn’t<a id="_idIndexMarker181"/> just a platform – it’s a <a id="_idIndexMarker182"/>licensed architecture and because of this, many manufacturers build custom variations of this architecture into their systems. In recent years, NVIDIA tried to buy the company that owns the rights and patent of the architecture. This didn’t happen as planned, but NVIDIA is now known for bringing the most advanced ARM-based solutions coupled with their industry-leading GPU technologies, and these are trending in the ever-growing AI/ML battlefield.</p>&#13;
			<p>The number of use cases where ARM is used as the platform is as vast as its ability to scale in terms of performance. This ranges from cellular phones to IoT devices and transcends to large-scale data center clusters of ARM with multiple onboard GPU-powered juggernaut servers. All of these require their manufacturers to pay license fees to the ARM corporation. If you’re interested in learning more about how this all works, I recommend taking a look at their website: <a href="https://www.arm.com/">https://www.arm.com/</a>.</p>&#13;
			<p>With all these different companies making their own version of the architecture, there have been hurdles in the Linux community in trying to support the platform as a whole. Many of these issues will be addressed in depth in the next chapter. So, if you’re looking for a hint of what’s to be discussed, I’ll offer a quick summary: UEFI BIOS compatibility, driver issues, and common tooling are the major hurdles in supporting this platform from a Linux perspective.</p>&#13;
			<p>Regardless<a id="_idIndexMarker183"/> of the perceived issues, some distributions of Linux thrive in this space, while others struggle to keep up and can only offer support for limited implementations of the ARM platform architecture. This platform and the next to be disc<a id="_idTextAnchor144"/>ussed are truly areas to keep your eyes on closely. Let’s move on.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-71"><a id="_idTextAnchor145"/>RISC-V®</h2>&#13;
			<p>RISC-V® is a<a id="_idIndexMarker184"/> new international open standard architecture <a id="_idIndexMarker185"/>that provides a framework for anyone to build a solution upon. Licensing is similar to the Open Source Software models. I find this to be game-changing. There is very little out there for support on this emerging platform at the time of writing, but in the next year or so, I suspect that RISC-V may give ARM a significant amount of competition, if not overtake it in the marketplace.  Recently, I started playing with this platform in my home lab. Many Linux distributions are rushing to add support for this game-changing platform. You should follow this one closely. Very, very close.</p>&#13;
			<p>For more information on thi<a id="_idTextAnchor146"/>s open architecture, visit the RISC-V website at <a href="https://riscv.org/">https://riscv.org/</a>.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-72"><a id="_idTextAnchor147"/>Power® and IBM Z®</h2>&#13;
			<p>These<a id="_idIndexMarker186"/> two IBM® platforms are generally known for their massive scale and resilience. IBM Z® is the mainframe platform that has been in production for longer than I can imagine and it’s still going strong in the Linux world. IBM® Power® systems<a id="_idIndexMarker187"/> haven’t been around as long but they too provide a certain niche environment that is still present in some industry verticals.</p>&#13;
			<p>These systems are the pillars of resilience and uptime. They are the cornerstone of taking damage and still going onward. That said, they are generally not the platform of choice for an embedded Linux systems appliance. They are large and require a very specific set of skills that are no longer prevalent in the IT industry.</p>&#13;
			<p>This is where my many years of experience come into play. Over the past decade, I’ve seen a couple of examples where these platforms are delivered as appliance solutions. Yes, I said it. These behemoths are delivered as appliances to their end-customers. These rare solutions generally focus on provisioning advanced storage and disaster recovery solutions for their end-customers, who need such advanced services but find them too complex in today’s X86-driven world.</p>&#13;
			<p>Designing, building, and supporting one of these solutions nowadays is considered a herculean effort. The skills required to master these platforms are becoming more and more rare <a id="_idIndexMarker188"/>as time progresses. For more information on the Power platform, visit the IBM website at <a href="https://www.ibm.com/power">https://www.ibm.com/power</a>. Additionally, for more information regarding the<a id="_idIndexMarker189"/> Z series platform, please visit the IBM website at <a href="https://www.ibm.com/z">https://www.ibm.com/z</a>. These systems are greatly resilient but require some deep, deep investments.</p>&#13;
			<p>With that, we’ve <a id="_idTextAnchor148"/>come to the end of this chapter. So, let’s summarize what we’ve learned.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-73"><a id="_idTextAnchor149"/>Summary</h1>&#13;
			<p>In this chapter, we covered a myriad of selection criteria. All of the data that we have reviewed in this chapter will directly relate to what operating system we select in the next chapter. It’s codependent. The hardware you choose for your solution will limit your choices of what Linux distribution can support your hardware and requirements properly.</p>&#13;
			<p>There is no <em class="italic">Easy Button</em> here for you to push and get answers. The platform you decide upon will be deeply tied to the options you have available for possible Linux distribution choices. This may not be a bad thing as there are many distributions of Linux to choose from. Any assistance in driving the selection may be useful. In this chapter, you learned how many of the complex hardware factors can impact the supportability of your system, limit the security profile, or simply become so complex that you may need to hire more specialized personnel to work with the platform.</p>&#13;
			<p>The greatest advice I can offer here is that you do your research and be diligent in not limiting yourself in this selection process. Having more options is a good thing. I wish the best of luck to you in this endeavor.</p>&#13;
			<p>In the next chapter, we will take everything we’ve reviewed here and apply that knowledge to various selection criteria so that you have the most adequate Linux distribution for your company’s solution.</p>&#13;
