<p class="mce-root">Many forensic examiners rely on commercial, push-button tools to retrieve and analyze data, even though there is no tool that does either of these jobs perfectly.</p>
<p class="mce-root"><em>Learning Android Forensics</em> will introduce you to the most up-to-date Android platform and its architecture, and provide a high-level overview of what Android forensics entails. You will understand how data is stored on Android devices and how to set up a digital forensic examination environment. As you make your way through the chapters, you will work through various physical and logical techniques to extract data from devices in order to obtain forensic evidence. You will also learn how to recover deleted data and forensically analyze application data with the help of various open source and commercial tools. In the concluding chapters, you will explore malware analysis so that you'll be able to investigate cyber security incidents involving Android malware.</p>
<p class="mce-root">By the end of this book, you will have a complete understanding of the Android forensic process, explored open source forensic tools, and investigated mobile cyber security incidents.</p>
