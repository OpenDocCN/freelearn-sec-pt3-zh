			<p><em class="italic">"All industries are facing the necessity to have subject matter experts on Cybersecurity; while the current reality has demonstrated a deficit of this profile in the market. This means an opportunity for us to get specialized on the matter and help industries to mitigate current and future Cybersecurity related risks."</em></p>
			<p><em class="italic">– Joel González Saldivar – Human resources and skills development expert México</em></p>
			<p>Policies, procedures, compliance, and audits are topics that may sound boring for technical specialists. However, they are of utter importance in the field of cybersecurity. </p>
			<p>In fact, policies and procedures are the backbone of all organizations' cybersecurity strategy and posture, while compliance and audits are the best mechanisms to ensure they are being followed; therefore, these are critical topics to be addressed by all cybersecurity professionals.</p>
			<p>You also need a tool to measure your level of cybersecurity as this will help you to understand where you are, where you want to be, and the path to get there. The best tool to enable you to achieve that is a <strong class="bold">Cybersecurity Maturity Model </strong>(<strong class="bold">CMM</strong>).</p>
			<p>In this chapter, we are going to cover the following topics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Understanding the value and importance of cybersecurity policies and procedures</li>
				<li>Implementing the <strong class="bold">Create, Update, Distribute, Socialize, Enforce</strong> (<strong class="bold">CUDSE</strong>) method to create and manage cybersecurity policies and procedures</li>
				<li>Understanding the impact of compliance and how to ensure you are always aligned</li>
				<li>Understanding the different types of audit and how to effectively manage them</li>
				<li>The benefits, characteristics, and structure of a good CMM </li>
				<li>An overview of the best CMM: the <strong class="bold">Enterprise Cybersecurity Maturity Model </strong>(<strong class="bold">ECM2</strong>)</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-67"><a id="_idTextAnchor069"/>Creating world-class cybersecurity policies and procedures</h1>
			<p>When we <a id="_idIndexMarker317"/>work <a id="_idIndexMarker318"/>in cybersecurity, we used to think about the technical side of it: how to secure our networks, how to develop better code, how to be more resilient, and so on. However, there is a very important layer that supports all those efforts, and is the backbone of enterprise-level security: the <strong class="bold">cybersecurity policies and procedures</strong>.</p>
			<p>However, creating them is not an easy task, and most people were never trained to do this. In fact, as IT professionals, we are used to following a tutorial or recipe to install a new system or server, but there is no such a thing as creating cybersecurity policies and procedures. </p>
			<p>Therefore, to<a id="_idIndexMarker319"/> make this task as simple as possible, I will show you the <strong class="bold">CUDSE method</strong> (<a href="http://www.cudse.com">www.cudse.com</a>), which has been successfully used by several companies around the world as a guideline for creating best-in-class cybersecurity policies and procedures. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-68"><a id="_idTextAnchor070"/>Cybersecurity policies</h2>
			<p>The main <a id="_idIndexMarker320"/>goal of defensive security is to keep your data and systems secure (available, confidential, and integral).</p>
			<p>To do<a id="_idIndexMarker321"/> that, we <a id="_idIndexMarker322"/>implement <em class="italic">systems</em> (such <a id="_idIndexMarker323"/>as an <strong class="bold">intrusion prevention system</strong> (<strong class="bold">IPS</strong>) and an <strong class="bold">intrusion detection system</strong> (<strong class="bold">IDS</strong>)), <em class="italic">strategies</em> (such<a id="_idIndexMarker324"/> as a <strong class="bold">Defense in Depth</strong> (<strong class="bold">DiD</strong>) strategy), and <em class="italic">plans</em> (such <a id="_idIndexMarker325"/>as a <strong class="bold">business continuity plan</strong> (<strong class="bold">BCP</strong>) and a <strong class="bold">disaster recovery plan</strong> (<strong class="bold">DRP</strong>)); however, you also need to create the <em class="italic">rules</em> that will govern all the factors around your infrastructure.</p>
			<p>Those rules can be related to a system (for example, an access policy), to a user (a password policy), or to data (a privacy policy).</p>
			<p>It is important to remember that <em class="italic">all policies</em> must be custom-made for each company. In fact, there are cases where a company may have different policies based on geography, and normally they are driven by the culture, local laws, regulations, and markets.</p>
			<p>However, there are some policies that are almost <em class="italic">standard</em> and present in most organizations. Some examples of these are shown in the following figure:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_3.1_B16290.jpg" alt="Figure 3.1 – Correlation of policies and procedures&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.1 – Correlation of policies and procedures</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Tip</p>
			<p class="callout">If you need a hand to start creating your policies, you can download a template from the internet and use it as a guide; for example, <a id="_idIndexMarker326"/>here is a good repository<a id="_idIndexMarker327"/> from the <strong class="bold">SysAdmin, Audit, Network, and Security</strong> (<strong class="bold">SANS</strong>) Institute: <a href="https://www.sans.org/information-security-policy/">https://www.sans.org/information-security-policy/</a>. However, as mentioned earlier, you need to make sure that you create policies that adhere to your organization, culture, and local regulations.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-69"><a id="_idTextAnchor071"/>Cybersecurity procedures</h2>
			<p>Procedures <a id="_idIndexMarker328"/>are step-by-step instructions that guide users on how to achieve a result that ensures compliance with a given policy.</p>
			<p>Usually, policies contain (or make reference to) a plurality of procedures aimed to guide users about how to perform a task to comply with the policy. The following figure illustrates this correlation of policies and procedures:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_3.2_B16290.jpg" alt="Figure 3.2 – Correlation of policies and procedures&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.2 – Correlation of policies and procedures</p>
			<p>For<a id="_idIndexMarker329"/> example, an <strong class="bold">Identity and Access Management</strong> (<strong class="bold">IAM</strong>) policy may make reference to the following procedures:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>How to remove <a id="_idIndexMarker330"/>users from <strong class="bold">Active Directory</strong> (<strong class="bold">AD</strong>)</li>
				<li>How <a id="_idIndexMarker331"/>to delete disabled IDs</li>
				<li>How to archive access logs</li>
				<li>How to elevate privileges on UNIX servers</li>
				<li>How to elevate privileges on Windows servers</li>
				<li>User notification procedure</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Those <em class="italic">invisible</em> layers are normally overlooked by cybersecurity professionals; however, it is of the utmost importance to invest time, knowledge, and resources to ensure they are properly <strong class="bold">created</strong>, <strong class="bold">updated</strong>, <strong class="bold">distributed</strong>, <strong class="bold">socialized</strong>, and <strong class="bold">enforced</strong>.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-70"><a id="_idTextAnchor072"/>The CUDSE method</h2>
			<p>A common <a id="_idIndexMarker332"/>mistake in cybersecurity is the lack of a clear guideline on how to address the creation of policies and procedures.</p>
			<p>This may be caused because we don't like to deal with non-technical stuff (it seems boring), because nobody seems to care about policies or procedures, or just because this is such a forgotten topic that almost no cybersecurity book talks about it.</p>
			<p>So, to fill this gap, I <a id="_idIndexMarker333"/>designed the <strong class="bold">CUDSE method</strong> (<a href="http://www.cudse.com">www.cudse.com</a>), which covers all the important aspects that you need to take into consideration when creating your cybersecurity policies and procedures. Let's take a look at this method now.</p>
			<h3>Create</h3>
			<p>First, you need to<a id="_idIndexMarker334"/> make sure you create meaningful policies that make sense to you and to your organization, and to achieve that you need to follow these simple rules:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Easy to understand</strong>: The reason people hate reading policies is because they seem to be written to be boring and complex. So, instead, write them using simple language to make them more appealing to the reader. <em class="italic">Keep it simple and keep it short</em>. As seen in the following table, a bad policy is complex, uses a lot of technicisms (which are irrelevant and confusing for most users), does not provide clear guidelines on how to be compliant, and refers to an unknown resource (no link provided). On the other hand, a good policy is clear, briefly talks about the problem it addresses, and provides a clear way to fix the problem and be compliant with the policy:</li>
			</ul>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_3.3_B16290.jpg" alt="Figure 3.3 – Example of a good policy and a bad policy&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.3 – Example of a good policy and a bad policy</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Easy to implement</strong>: Make sure that what you write can be implemented and enforced, otherwise you are wasting your time. A good tip is to work closely with <strong class="bold">Human Resources</strong> (<strong class="bold">HR</strong>) to <a id="_idIndexMarker335"/>ensure that all policies can be enforced and that there are no conflicts with local regulations, laws, or rights.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Integrated</strong>: As<a id="_idIndexMarker336"/> you surely know, technologies need to be integrated to close any possible gaps, and policies are no different. They need to be smartly integrated to ensure that there are no gaps to bypass them. For example, as seen in the following figure, you may have a plurality of policies that together will be the baseline of your defensive security: </li>
			</ul>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_3.4_B16290.jpg" alt="Figure 3.4 – Integration of policies&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.4 – Integration of policies</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Inclusive and cooperative</strong>: Remember, you are not alone in this. In fact, if you sit at your desk to write all policies by yourself, you will be making a grave mistake. Instead, work with each area or department in your company to develop those guidelines together. This will help you to create better policies and also to gain buy-in from the people concerned. As mentioned earlier, HR is one of your biggest allies in this endeavor.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Use dummy-proof examples</strong>: Use examples that people can easily understand and relate to and that illustrate the point you are trying to make. A good way to achieve this is by using a <em class="italic">Dos and Don'ts table</em>, as follows: </li>
			</ul>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_3.5_B16290.jpg" alt="Figure 3.5 – Example of a dummy-proof policy &#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.5 – Example of a dummy-proof policy </p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Get approvals</strong>: Find out who needs to review and approve these policies before moving to the next step. Most of the time, HR or the legal department can help you to identify the individuals, teams, or groups that need to review and approve your cool policies.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Update</h3>
			<p>In the same<a id="_idIndexMarker337"/> way you keep your servers up to date (to protect against new threats), you must also do this with your policies. </p>
			<p>But this is harder because <em class="italic">this is not about adding a check to ensure your policies get daily updates</em>; instead, you need to determine a time when every policy needs to be reviewed and analyzed to ensure they are still relevant in the current threat landscape (normally, a yearly review is acceptable).</p>
			<p>However, there are some events that may trigger an early review of your policies, as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Changes to the corporate policies</li>
				<li>Acquisitions of new companies</li>
				<li>New laws and regulations</li>
				<li>Opening of businesses/offices in new geographies<p class="callout-heading">Tip</p><p class="callout">Make sure <a id="_idIndexMarker338"/>that all updates and revisions made to policies and procedures are properly tracked in the version history of the document.</p></li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Distribute</h3>
			<p>A very <a id="_idIndexMarker339"/>common mistake observed is that policies are distributed once they are created and then abandoned in an almost <em class="italic">unknown</em> location. I have seen cases<a id="_idIndexMarker340"/> where not even the <strong class="bold">chief information security officer</strong> (<strong class="bold">CISO</strong>) knows the location of those policies, so it is imperative that you make sure that cybersecurity policies are distributed to all employees in an organized manner.</p>
			<p>As confirmed by the attorney and cybersecurity expert Roberto Lemaître, "<em class="italic">you can't enforce any penalties or sanctions for violating a policy if you don't have proof that it was properly shared or distributed."</em></p>
			<p>Therefore, this is not only about distribution but also about securing confirmation from the employees that the policy was received.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Tip</p>
			<p class="callout">Marking a checkbox online is a very easy way to get confirmation from a user in a legally enforceable way. However, always check with your legal department to ensure adherence to corporate policies and local regulations and laws.</p>
			<p>Now, you need to create a distribution strategy, and this can be as simple as defining when policies need to be distributed (or redistributed). Example scenarios are shown here:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>When the policy is created or updated</li>
				<li>During the onboarding of new employees</li>
				<li>As part of annual required training</li>
				<li>When a <a id="_idIndexMarker341"/><a id="_idIndexMarker342"/>person changes their current role</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Socialize</h3>
			<p>Some<a id="_idIndexMarker343"/> companies only go as far as distributing the policies without any further follow-up activity. However, <em class="italic">that is not enough</em>!</p>
			<p>To be successful, you need to make sure that those policies and their associated procedures become part of the organizational culture.</p>
			<p><em class="italic">This is not easy to achieve, but once a policy becomes part of the organizational culture, then everyone will naturally support and enforce the policy</em>. </p>
			<p>Additionally, this will also help you ensure that new employees adhere to the policies or adopt them faster. For example, if <em class="italic">everyone</em> locks the computer even to wake up for a second, then new employees will naturally do the same, even if they have not read the policy.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Tip</p>
			<p class="callout">As you may have already guessed, making cybersecurity policies part of the organizational culture will allow you to significantly reduce future costs in policy training and education.</p>
			<p>Here are some tips to help you with this step:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Develop constant educational campaigns that include training, flyers, emails, and so on.</li>
				<li>Identify influencers and assign them as champions of one policy (to help in promoting compliance).</li>
				<li>Get buy-in from upper management and request their support to communicate the importance of having cybersecurity policies.</li>
				<li>Get buy-in from HR and request their support to communicate the consequences <a id="_idIndexMarker344"/>of not following cybersecurity policies.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Enforce</h3>
			<p>As the owner<a id="_idIndexMarker345"/> of the policy, you must determine <em class="italic">who</em> is in charge of making sure that the policy is being followed, as well as who is in charge of the application of sanctions in the case of violations.</p>
			<p>In most cases, you will be the one with access and knowledge to the tools that may detect any violation to such policies, therefore you must define a procedure on how you are going to manage these interactions (normally with upper management, HR, and the legal department).</p>
			<p>Another way to enforce this is by leveraging some technical tools—for example, you can enforce the password policy on the Active Directory, make encryption mandatory on emails, and so on.</p>
			<p>Another—less technical—way to do this is by updating corporate templates to make sure users don't forget to fill in some mandatory fields—for example, include a footnote in all corporate templates to ensure that <em class="italic">data classification</em> is properly labeled (Public, Private, Confidential, and Restri<a id="_idTextAnchor073"/>cted).</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-71"><a id="_idTextAnchor074"/>Understanding and achieving compliance</h1>
			<p>Companies may be required to adhere to a plurality of laws and regulations governing how data should be stored, managed, and processed. As with any other law, failure to comply may result in fines or other legal consequences that may culminate in the shutdown of the business, therefore they need to be taken very seriously.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-72"><a id="_idTextAnchor075"/>Types of regulations</h2>
			<p>Before <a id="_idIndexMarker346"/>we look at how to achieve compliance, let's look at the types of regulations based on the source.</p>
			<h3>Country regulations</h3>
			<p>These are<a id="_idIndexMarker347"/> laws and regulations created by governments<a id="_idIndexMarker348"/> to regulate how data should be stored, managed, and processed by private companies.</p>
			<p>These regulations can be tricky because they may protect the individuals of the country regardless of the location of the company, so you need to also understand the regulations associated with the geographical location of your users or clients.</p>
			<h3>Regional regulations</h3>
			<p>These<a id="_idIndexMarker349"/> regulations <a id="_idIndexMarker350"/>are very similar to country regulations, but they cover several countries. Those countries are normally tied by some international cooperation treaty, such as<a id="_idIndexMarker351"/> the <strong class="bold">General Data Protection Regulation</strong> (<strong class="bold">GDPR</strong>) created by the <strong class="bold">European Union</strong> (<strong class="bold">EU</strong>). </p>
			<h4>GDPR</h4>
			<p>A famous <a id="_idIndexMarker352"/>example of a regional regulation is the GDPR, whose<a id="_idIndexMarker353"/> logo is shown in the following figure: </p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_3.6_B16290.jpg" alt="Figure 3.6 – EU flag representing the GDPR logo &#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.6 – EU flag representing the GDPR logo </p>
			<p>This is an EU regulation about data protection and privacy, aimed primarily at giving individuals control over their data and over how companies handle it.</p>
			<p>This regulation is complex as it also applies to companies outside of the EU that manage the data of EU citizens. </p>
			<p>While there is a lot of criticism about the costs associated in complying with this regulation, some experts embrace this as a legal mechanism, to encourage companies to have a better cybersecurity posture and to prevent misuse of personal information.</p>
			<p>Another good reason to comply is the astronomical cost of the associated fines. As an example, British Airways had to pay more than 200 million <strong class="bold">US Dollars</strong> (<strong class="bold">USD</strong>) due to poor security<a id="_idIndexMarker354"/> practices that caused a massive breach of client <a id="_idIndexMarker355"/>information.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Tip</p>
			<p class="callout">In some cases, regional or international regulations are above local regulations, so the recommendation is to work with your legal department to analyze them carefully.</p>
			<h3>Market/industry regulations</h3>
			<p>There are<a id="_idIndexMarker356"/> some<a id="_idIndexMarker357"/> regulations associated with certain markets or industries. Some of those regulations are very rigorous and may also apply to suppliers and vendors, so it is imperative that you know your business to make sure you are compliant.</p>
			<p>In case your company is in the services sphere, it could be a good strategy to be compliant with these sorts of regulations as that is a great way to attract top-tier customers.</p>
			<p>Some <a id="_idIndexMarker358"/>examples <a id="_idIndexMarker359"/>of<a id="_idIndexMarker360"/> those regulations <a id="_idIndexMarker361"/>are outlined here:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996</strong> (<strong class="bold">HIPAA</strong>)</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Sarbanes-Oxley</strong> (<strong class="bold">SOX</strong>) Act of 2002 </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)</strong></li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Client regulations</h3>
			<p>Some<a id="_idIndexMarker362"/> clients may demand that their service providers <a id="_idIndexMarker363"/>adhere to a set of regulations in order to do business with them. Most of the time, those regulations are a subset of the regulations mentioned previously (country, regional, or market), and companies use them to ensure their providers have a given level of security in their environment. So, while your organization may not be legally required to comply with those regulations, they must do so to maintain business with those<a id="_idIndexMarker364"/> clients.</p>
			<h3>Internal regulations</h3>
			<p>Big international <a id="_idIndexMarker365"/>corporations may have their own<a id="_idIndexMarker366"/> cybersecurity regulations aimed at maintaining a given level of security across all divisions and geographies.</p>
			<p>These regulations are very similar to company policies, but large corporations prefer to use the term <em class="italic">regulation</em>, especially when they have big operations in different countries. This term is also widely used in franchises, to ensure that each franchisee is aligned with their internal cybersecurity regulations.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Tip</p>
			<p class="callout">Create a matrix with the regulations that apply to your infrastructure to make sure you <em class="italic">keep them in your radar at all times</em>, and ensure that they are accounted for when you create your security strategies and policies (see 	an example of this in <em class="italic">Figure 3.5</em>).</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-73"><a id="_idTextAnchor076"/>Achieving compliance</h2>
			<p>As explained <a id="_idIndexMarker367"/>earlier, achieving compliance is a very complex task that may require a considerable investment of time and resources. However, there are some clear incentives that you can provide to senior management to justify an investment in compliance, as illustrated in the following figure: </p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_3.7_B16290.jpg" alt="Figure 3.7 – Benefits of achieving compliance with external regulations &#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.7 – Benefits of achieving compliance with external regulations </p>
			<p>These points should be strong enough to ensure <em class="italic">buy-in</em> from upper management (in fact, just the<a id="_idIndexMarker368"/> first point should be more than enough). Let's now focus on some good practices that you can apply to achieve compliance with most regulations.</p>
			<h3>Creating a plan </h3>
			<p>Let's be<a id="_idIndexMarker369"/> honest—compliance is a very complex task, so in this case the best way to deal with the pain is to invest some time in <em class="italic">planning</em>. Remember that compliance has a binary result—you are either complaint or not; so, as my grandpa used to say: <em class="italic">If you got to do it, you better do it right!</em></p>
			<p>Now, don't see planning as a waste of time—instead, think of it as a tool to ensure that you have a clear path to follow to achieve the required compliance level. </p>
			<p>To make this as simple as possible, I will summarize here the items that you need to include to create a great <em class="italic">compliance plan</em>:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Title</strong>: Name of the regulation or regulations that will be covered by this plan.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Stakeholders</strong>: Names of the people associated with this regulation—for example, the HR manager, legal <a id="_idIndexMarker370"/>counsel, <strong class="bold">chief financial officer</strong> (<strong class="bold">CFO</strong>), and so on.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Regulation details</strong>: A detailed list of the requirements to comply with said regulation—for example, encryption requirements, data handling requirements, and so on.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Penalties and sanctions</strong>: Here, you need to include all the penalties and sanctions related <a id="_idIndexMarker371"/>to each regulation. Also, remember that this is mostly a legal topic, so you <em class="italic">must</em> work with your legal department to properly create this section of the plan. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Scope</strong>: The scope of action of the regulation. This could be defined by geography, industry, and so on.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Impact</strong>: A detailed list of the systems, servers, services, data, and any other IT components that will be impacted by this regulation. Also, make sure you include the name of the owners so that you have them handy.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Relevant dates</strong>: Here, you need to add two different set of dates—firstly, the dates related to when the regulation will come into effect, and secondly, the dates by which you plan to be compliant.<p class="callout-heading">One plan or two plans?</p><p class="callout">Normally, you will create a single plan for compliance, but if you work for a big organization or your company needs to comply with too many regulations, then it may be a good idea to have several plans. A good option is to break the regulations (based on the types explained earlier) into groups and create a plan for each group.</p></li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Creating a compliance team</h3>
			<p>As I already <a id="_idIndexMarker372"/>mentioned in this book, <em class="italic">a good cybersecurity professional is not the one that does everything by themselves, but the one that knows how to get things done</em>.</p>
			<p>Therefore, you need to learn to work with other professionals to achieve your goals.</p>
			<p>A good way to do this is by creating support teams and—in this case—creating a compliance team who will help you to get things moving faster and better.</p>
			<p>Now, this is not about randomly asking who wants to be part of a team; instead, it is about selecting a group of people who have some interest in this regulation. For example, the e-commerce (sales) department<a id="_idIndexMarker373"/> may be a good stakeholder for <strong class="bold">Payment Card Industry</strong> (<strong class="bold">PCI</strong>) certification, while the HR, legal, and medical departments will be the ideal stakeholders for HIPAA.</p>
			<h3>Leveraging your existing information </h3>
			<p>You can <a id="_idIndexMarker374"/>leverage your business information—such <a id="_idIndexMarker375"/>as a <strong class="bold">business impact analysis</strong> (<strong class="bold">BIA</strong>) or risk assessment—to determine the current efforts that you can leverage to comply with a given regulation. </p>
			<p>As we mentioned in <a href="B16290_02_Final_JC_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor035"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>, <em class="italic">Managing Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Risks</em>, risk assessment is an iterative process, and this review may trigger a change in the previously specified response to a risk—for example, a <em class="italic">risk</em> that a company decided to <em class="italic">accept</em> may need to be <em class="italic">remediated</em>, as accepting it is not an appropriate response when dealing with regulations.</p>
			<h3>Reviewing your current controls</h3>
			<p><em class="italic">Remember—we need to work smarter, not harder</em>, and one way to be smarter is to leverage<a id="_idIndexMarker376"/> current systems and controls to achieve new goals. </p>
			<p>Do an inventory of your current controls and correlate them against the regulation to determine which controls can be used to comply with that regulation.</p>
			<p>You will find that many times, you just need to do some adjustments in your current systems in order to be aligned with the regulations.</p>
			<h3>Aligning compliance requirements with cybersecurity policies</h3>
			<p>Not all<a id="_idIndexMarker377"/> regulations can be <a id="_idIndexMarker378"/>addressed with systems because there are many regulations related to users and, in those cases, you need policies.</p>
			<p><em class="italic">However, as mentioned earlier, you want to keep your policies simple, so try to leverage your existing cybersecurity policies instead of creating new ones. </em></p>
			<p>I know that there will be cases in which you may have to create new policies, but that will only happen when you confirm that current policies do not apply.</p>
			<p>A good solution is to create a policy matrix, as seen in the following table, in which you can map your current policies against the applicable regulations:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_3.8_B16290.jpg" alt="Figure 3.8 – Cybersecurity policy matrix&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.8 – Cybersecurity policy matrix</p>
			<p>Such a matrix will help you to easily identify any change that needs to be made on the policy (based on a change in the regulations) or confirm that there will be no compliance impact if a policy is updated.</p>
			<h3>Establishing mechanisms to validate compliance </h3>
			<p>As of <a id="_idIndexMarker379"/>now, we have developed a framework to ensure you are aligned with any given regulation, but <em class="italic">this is not a one-time effort</em>. Instead, compliance is something that needs to be sustained over time, so you need to put a mechanism in place to make sure that you are compliant and that you stay compliant over time.</p>
			<p>The mechanisms used to test and verify compliance are called <strong class="bold">audits</strong>.</p>

			<p>At this <a id="_idIndexMarker380"/>point, we<a id="_idIndexMarker381"/> have<a id="_idIndexMarker382"/> reviewed concepts such as <em class="italic">policies</em>, <em class="italic">regulations</em>, and also a very cool defensive security strategy: <em class="italic">Defense in Depth</em>; however, all these policies, systems, strategies, and controls need to be tested to ensure they are giving the required results and that they are being implemented and followed.</p>
			<p>In simple words, <em class="italic">an audit is a process to test the compliance level of a set of policies, regulations, or requirements</em>.</p>
			<p>Audits can be internal or external, so let's take a quick look at both.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-75"><a id="_idTextAnchor078"/>Internal cybersecurity audits</h2>
			<p>Normally, these<a id="_idIndexMarker383"/> audits are designed by an organization<a id="_idIndexMarker384"/> to ensure their systems, users, and data are compliant with a set of policies and regulations.</p>
			<p>Large corporations may have a corporate-wide audit that includes <em class="italic">data security</em> as part of the audit.</p>
			<p>In most cases, corporate auditors report directly to C-level management to ensure their results are <em class="italic">as objective as possible</em>.</p>
			<p>Due to the level of visibility of these audits, it is recommended that you perform internal (departmental) cybersecurity<a id="_idIndexMarker385"/> audits of your systems to make sure your environment is <strong class="bold">audit-ready</strong>.</p>
			<p>As seen in the following diagram, you may have departmental audits (Wintel team; UNIX Team; IAM team), then organizational audits (networks; development; support), and having both covered will ensure that your IT department remains in <strong class="bold">audit-ready</strong> mode:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_3.9_B16290.jpg" alt="Figure 3.9 – Internal audit structure&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.9 – Internal audit structure</p>
			<p>If your company does not perform audits, then <em class="italic">you must create your own security audits</em> as that is<a id="_idIndexMarker386"/> one of the best mechanisms to ensure that your <a id="_idIndexMarker387"/>policies and controls are in place and are being followed as expected.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-76"><a id="_idTextAnchor079"/>External cybersecurity audits</h2>
			<p>In many cases, companies<a id="_idIndexMarker388"/> are required to be audited by a <a id="_idIndexMarker389"/>third party in order to verify their level of compliance with a law or regulation.</p>
			<p>There are also cases in which a company may want a third party to validate that cybersecurity policies are being followed.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Tip</p>
			<p class="callout">You must ensure that the company performing the audit is not the same company that provides you some cybersecurity services, as that may create some conflicts of interest and may impact the neutrality and objectivity of the results.</p>
			<p>In some cases, the third party will announce the audit to give you some time to prepare the evidence required (logs, reports, and so on), but in other cases an auditor may show up to verify compliance right on the spot, requesting access to servers, validating physical access, and more.</p>
			<p>Normally, the result of the audit (called <em class="italic">findings</em>) will be provided to C-level management and then it will cascade down to you, and that highlights the importance of having your environment <em class="italic">audit-ready</em> at all times.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">The auditor</p>
			<p class="callout">There is a big debate about whether a cybersecurity auditor should or should not be a cybersecurity expert. However, that depends on the goal of the audit. </p>
			<p class="callout">If the <strong class="bold">chief executive officer</strong> (<strong class="bold">CEO</strong>) wants a basic audit of policies based on a checklist, then I <a id="_idIndexMarker390"/>don't see a reason for hiring a cybersecurity professional. On the other hand, if the goal of the audit is to perform a real test of the level of data security in the organization, then I would say that a cybersecurity professional is a <em class="italic">must</em>.</p>
			<p>Now that we <a id="_idIndexMarker391"/>have seen both types of audits (internal and<a id="_idIndexMarker392"/> external), let's move on to see some best practices for how systems and data need to be managed during an audit.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-77"><a id="_idTextAnchor080"/>Data management during audits</h2>
			<p>You need to <a id="_idIndexMarker393"/>pay special attention to the way you manage data and systems during an audit. </p>
			<p>In general, it is recommended to put—<em class="italic">on</em> <em class="italic">hold</em>—any change to the infrastructure to avoid impacts during an audit. Additionally, there are some specific items that you need to consider during an audit, and these are different depending on if you are the auditor or the person being audited (owner of the systems being audited).</p>
			<h3>As the person being audited</h3>
			<p>In this case, you will be responsible for providing all the data and access required by the auditor.</p>
			<p>However, giving this level of access to a third party (or even someone outside of your organization) is very risky, so I compiled the following list of tips that may help you to reduce that risk:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em class="italic">Always</em> do a backup before someone touches your systems and data. This is very important as it lets you do a quick recovery in case any data gets accidentally corrupted (or modified/deleted) during the audit.</li>
				<li>Use the <strong class="bold">principle of least privilege</strong> (<strong class="bold">PoLP</strong>) when<a id="_idIndexMarker394"/> giving access to an auditor.</li>
				<li><em class="italic">Avoid</em> giving external access to your systems for audit purposes. Instead, request that the auditor perform the audit on-site to reduce risks.</li>
				<li>Make sure you comply with the <em class="italic">data retention policy</em> to ensure that all required logs are available for the audit.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Also, make sure you <a id="_idIndexMarker395"/>check with your HR and legal department to ensure that the external auditor signs all required documentation, to reduce the <a id="_idIndexMarker396"/>risk of exfiltration of data (such as signing a <strong class="bold">non-disclosure agreement</strong> (<strong class="bold">NDA</strong>), confidentiality clauses, and so on).</p>
			<h3>As an auditor</h3>
			<p>Auditors have a huge responsibility because the results of their findings may have legal, monetary, or professional consequences. Therefore, as an auditor you must adhere not only to high ethical standards but also to technical standards, to ensure that the data gathered is not tampered with. Here are the best practices:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Adhere to best practices when gathering evidence. A good example is to <em class="italic">hash the files</em> before extracting them from the source. That way, you can demonstrate that the data you have was not altered.</li>
				<li>If you foresee any <em class="italic">conflict of interest</em>—for example, a family relation with the CISO of the company being audited—then speak up before you start to avoid the audit findings getting questioned.</li>
				<li>Sometimes, you may find errors that can be fixed with a simple click on a checkbox, but as an auditor your job is to report and not to fix, so <em class="italic">do not fall into the temptation to apply quick fixes</em>.</li>
				<li>Remember that your access may be monitored, so <em class="italic">do not abuse your access</em>. Something as simple as accessing a folder or files that were not strictly necessary as part of your audit may result in fines or legal action against you and your company, so remember: <em class="italic">with great power comes great responsibility</em>.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Some companies use <em class="italic">generic</em> auditors to perform all type of audits (including security audits). However, an auditor without basic cybersecurity knowledge may <em class="italic">overlook</em> some situations <a id="_idIndexMarker397"/>or can be easily tricked, so the best practice is that <em class="italic">cybersecurity audits must be done by auditors with at least basic knowledge in cybersecurity</em>.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-78"><a id="_idTextAnchor081"/>Types of cybersecurity audit</h2>
			<p>You can audit<a id="_idIndexMarker398"/> almost anything; however, that doesn't mean you are going to waste time and resources on auditing, so next is a list of the most common audits performed in the area of cybersecurity.</p>
			<h3>Systems audit</h3>
			<p>These audits <a id="_idIndexMarker399"/>are normally aimed at testing the level<a id="_idIndexMarker400"/> of compliance of your servers against the cybersecurity policies. Most of the time this is segmented by the operating system, so you may have an audit for Wintel, UNIX, Red Hat, and so on.</p>
			<p>Depending on the scope, this may also include the following: IAM, passwords, and data retention.</p>
			<h3>Policy audit</h3>
			<p>This is <a id="_idIndexMarker401"/>normally an extensive audit that tests the<a id="_idIndexMarker402"/> level of compliance of all cybersecurity policies in a company.</p>
			<h3>IAM audit</h3>
			<p>This audit is <a id="_idIndexMarker403"/>about making sure that all IAM processes are <a id="_idIndexMarker404"/>aligned with a given policy or regulation. This may include the creation of users, disabling users, the deletion of users, and so on.</p>
			<h3>Data-handling audit</h3>
			<p>This is<a id="_idIndexMarker405"/> one of <a id="_idIndexMarker406"/>the most complex audits because data can be associated with a plurality of factors that may impact the regulation or policies related—for example, owner of the data, location of the data, classification of the data, purpose of the data, and so on.</p>
			<p>International regulations such as HIPAA, PCI, and GDPR are highly focused on auditing data.</p>
			<h3>Network audit</h3>
			<p>This is often<a id="_idIndexMarker407"/> associated with pentesting because it is <a id="_idIndexMarker408"/>aimed at testing the level of compliance of a network, and many times, you need to perform a pentest to successfully audit the level of compliance of a network.</p>
			<p>The most frequently used tools for this<a id="_idIndexMarker409"/> purpose are <strong class="bold">Nmap</strong> and <strong class="bold">Wireshark</strong> (both will <a id="_idIndexMarker410"/>be <a id="_idIndexMarker411"/>covered <a id="_idIndexMarker412"/>in <a href="B16290_08_Final_JC_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor193"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></a>, <em class="italic">Enhancing Your Network Defensive Skills</em>). Other tools—such as <strong class="bold">Nessus</strong>, <strong class="bold">Open Vulnerability Assessment System</strong> (<strong class="bold">OpenVAS</strong>), <strong class="bold">Acunetix</strong>, <strong class="bold">SolarWinds</strong> and <strong class="bold">ManageEngine</strong>—are <a id="_idIndexMarker413"/>also <a id="_idIndexMarker414"/>used on<a id="_idIndexMarker415"/> these types of audits.</p>
			<p>The following screenshot shows the Nessus interface:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_3.10_B16290.jpg" alt="Figure 3.10 – Nessus interface&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.10 – Nessus interface</p>
			<p>Additionally, these tools can also be used as a low-cost and convenient solution to test our infrastructure against a given threat or vulnerability<a id="_idIndexMarker416"/> such as <strong class="bold">Spectre Meltdown</strong>, or to determine<a id="_idIndexMarker417"/> if we are compliant against a given<a id="_idIndexMarker418"/> standard such as PCI DDS.</p>
			<h3>Physical access audit</h3>
			<p>This audit<a id="_idIndexMarker419"/> is about testing all your mechanisms <a id="_idIndexMarker420"/>and controls related to physical access, and this is not just about physical access to the server room, but all systems to control and restrict physical access to the company building.</p>
			<p>In fact, <em class="italic">physical security</em> (which we will see in depth in <a href="B16290_09_Final_JC_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor213"><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em></a>, <em class="italic">Deep Diving into Physical Security</em>) must be at the core of your defense strategy because the associated risks (for<a id="_idIndexMarker421"/> example, the <strong class="bold">Universal Serial Bus</strong> (<strong class="bold">USB</strong>) vulnerabilities reviewed in <em class="italic">Chapter 2</em>, <em class="italic">Managing Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Risks</em>) may cause a catastrophic impact to a company.</p>
			<p>Additionally, an intruder may have access to the most vulnerable asset—<em class="italic">the users</em>, and could gain access to valuable information just by talking with them (we will see more about this type of social engineering attack in <a href="B16290_04_Final_JC_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor092"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></a>, <em class="italic">Patching Layer 8</em>).</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">One of the biggest hacks of a social network was one targeting Twitter, in which an attacker was able to compromise the top 100 accounts (influencers with +2 million followers) by<a id="_idIndexMarker422"/> using social engineering <a id="_idIndexMarker423"/>techniques against some Twitter employees. </p>
			<h3>Code audits</h3>
			<p>These<a id="_idIndexMarker424"/> audits can be focused on a plurality of factors, such <a id="_idIndexMarker425"/>as the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Identification of bugs</li>
				<li>Auditing the functionality of the code</li>
				<li>Auditing the security of the code (to make sure best practices were applied)</li>
				<li>Adherence<a id="_idIndexMarker426"/> to a given development framework (such as the <strong class="bold">Software Development Life Cycle</strong> (<strong class="bold">SDLC</strong>) and <strong class="bold">Agile</strong> development)</li>
				<li>General best practices (such as comments and indentation)</li>
				<li>Version management</li>
				<li>Secure code repositories and deployment rules</li>
			</ul>
			<p>There is a common misconception that these audits are <em class="italic">exclusively applied on software development companies</em>; however, if a company modifies some of their apps, then code audits are still applicable.</p>
			<h3>Password compliance audits</h3>
			<p>Most <a id="_idIndexMarker427"/>modern<a id="_idIndexMarker428"/> systems have tools in place to ensure user passwords are compliant with company policies; however, there are some legacy systems that lack this capability and therefore may enable users to select non-compliant passwords.</p>
			<p>Another risk is that a privileged account (such as root) may be able to <em class="italic">bypass</em> those restrictions and set up a non-compliant password on other user accounts.</p>
			<p>Additionally, there is also a risk of devices being left with default passwords (very common on <a id="_idIndexMarker429"/>network and <strong class="bold">Internet of Things</strong> (<strong class="bold">IoT</strong>) devices).</p>
			<p>Therefore, many companies invest in having at least an annual review of their systems (servers, network devices, IoT devices, and others) to make sure that all passwords are complaint <a id="_idIndexMarker430"/>with current password <a id="_idIndexMarker431"/>policies.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-79"><a id="_idTextAnchor082"/>What triggers an audit?</h2>
			<p>There are several <a id="_idIndexMarker432"/>factors that may trigger an audit—for example, external audits are usually very expensive, so they are performed when required by a regulation such as PCI.</p>
			<p>Internal (corporate) audits are also expensive because of the resources that need to be dedicated to this effort, so these audits are normally scheduled by upper management based on budget.</p>
			<p>Now, you may wonder: <em class="italic">Is there a mechanism that I can use to test my environment that is easier and faster but also enables me to know not just where I am in terms of security, but also how to achieve the next level?</em> </p>
			<p>Yes—this is called a <strong class="bold">Cybersecurity Maturity Model</strong>.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-80"><a id="_idTextAnchor083"/>Applying a CMM</h1>
			<p>The main idea <a id="_idIndexMarker433"/>behind a CMM is to provide a standard mechanism for any organization to perform a self-assessment of their cybersecurity level.</p>
			<p>They are being used and implemented by many organizations all around the globe, from top multinational organizations to small businesses, and each can leverage all the advantages associated with the implementation of a CMM.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-81"><a id="_idTextAnchor084"/>The goals of a CMM</h2>
			<p>A CMM is a<a id="_idIndexMarker434"/> great tool that allows cybersecurity professionals to achieve the following three goals:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Determine (by using a standardized mechanism) the level of cybersecurity of a given company.</li>
				<li>Determine, based on company objectives (or regulations), the expected level of cybersecurity (based on a standardized mechanism).</li>
				<li>A clear path to go from point #1 to point #2.</li>
			</ol>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-82"><a id="_idTextAnchor085"/>Characteristics of a good CMM</h2>
			<p>A good CMM needs<a id="_idIndexMarker435"/> to have the following characteristics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Easy to implement</strong>: We don't want the complexity of an <strong class="bold">International Standards for Organization</strong> (<strong class="bold">ISO</strong>) system; we want something that can be self-explanatory and easy to follow so that organizations can use their own resources to implement it.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Integral view of cybersecurity</strong>: A good CMM is not just about assessing the servers and network but also about assessing all the components that may affect the overall cybersecurity posture—for example, human resources (does the company have appropriate disciplinary processes in place?) or suppliers (controls; <strong class="bold">service-level agreements</strong> (<strong class="bold">SLAs</strong>); penalties). </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Customizable</strong>: You should be able to easily tweak it based on the needs of the business. This means that you can add or remove sections without affecting the final result of the evaluation.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Scalable</strong>: A good CMM should be able to be used by a small company as well as a big international corporation.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Adaptable</strong>: It should be adaptable to any industry, any requirement, and any geography.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Clearly defined levels</strong>: The CMM must have the same levels (ratings) across all domains to ensure the results are realistic and can be successfully used as a benchmark.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>There are several kinds of CMM available—some of them are proprietary (used internally by some companies); some of them are private (you need to pay first in order to see them, which I<a id="_idIndexMarker436"/> don't think is a good idea); and some of them are public (those are the best because normally, they are open and receive feedback from the community).</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-83"><a id="_idTextAnchor086"/>The structure of a good CMM</h2>
			<p>A good CMM must <a id="_idIndexMarker437"/>be modular so that the company implementing it can add or remove sections without impacting the final results—for example, not all companies have developers, so asking a company without developers to fill in those sections just to complete the model doesn't make any sense.</p>
			<h3>Domains and controls</h3>
			<p>When<a id="_idIndexMarker438"/> implementing<a id="_idIndexMarker439"/> the CMM, the IT person in charge of it (let's say <em class="italic">an analyst</em>) will assess a plurality of items <a id="_idIndexMarker440"/>called <strong class="bold">controls</strong>. </p>
			<p>To make the implementation (including the analysis of the results) easier, the controls should be logically grouped with other<a id="_idIndexMarker441"/> related controls. These groups are called <strong class="bold">domains</strong>.</p>
			<p>As seen in the following table, a good CMM evaluates other areas that have a direct impact on your cybersecurity strategy—for example, HR: </p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_3.11_B16290.jpg" alt="Figure 3.11 – Domains and controls of ECM2 &#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.11 – Domains and controls of ECM2 </p>
			<p><strong class="bold">ECM2</strong> is modular and it contains a comprehensive list of 14 domains, from which you can select <a id="_idIndexMarker442"/>the <a id="_idIndexMarker443"/>ones that are relevant to your organization.</p>
			<h3>Maturity levels</h3>
			<p>Now that you <a id="_idIndexMarker444"/>have the controls sorted by domain, it's time to evaluate them. The evaluation should be done using a scale that clearly defines each level. The most common evaluation scales are 3-level, 5-level, and +7-level scales. </p>
			<p>A 3-level scale may be very simplistic and gives you very little room for rating and improvement, therefore that is not the best option for you.</p>
			<p>On the other hand, a +7-level scale may be too complex to evaluate, analyze, and report, and since one of the goals of a CMM is to be simple to implement, then this is not a good option either.</p>
			<p>However, a 5-level scale is considered the best standard because it allows you to accurately rate a control or domain without unnecessary complications.</p>
			<p>The following table illustrates how all the components come together on the assessment page of a CMM. This is based on Enterprise Cybersecurity Maturity Model (<a href="http://www.ecm2.info">www.ecm2.info</a>), and you can see how easy it will be for you to assess the cybersecurity level of your company using this model:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_3.12_B16290.jpg" alt="Figure 3.12 – Enterprise Cybersecurity Maturity Model &#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.12 – Enterprise Cybersecurity Maturity Model </p>
			<p>Here, you can <a id="_idIndexMarker445"/>see that we are evaluating a control related to <strong class="bold">Segregation of duties</strong>, which is part of the <strong class="bold">Corporate organization related to cybersecurity</strong> domain, where you will have to select which of the five levels provided <em class="italic">truly</em> represents the current reality of your company.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-84"><a id="_idTextAnchor087"/>Analyzing the results</h2>
			<p>The analysis of<a id="_idIndexMarker446"/> results is also a very simple task with <strong class="bold">ECM2</strong>. Once you finish assessing all the relevant controls and domains, you will get three different reports, as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">By control</strong>: This is very useful when you want to support your budget request in one area—for example, the lack of an IAM system and the risk of not having one.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">By domain</strong>: This is very simple to calculate; basically, the level of the domain is equal to the rate of the lowest control. For example, if you have very good cybersecurity policies (Level 4) but the company lacks a plan to distribute them (Level 0), then the overall rate of the cybersecurity policies domain is 0. These results are exceptionally useful in helping you define weak areas in which you should be investing your budget (it's better to have all controls at Level 2 than having two at Level 4 and two at Level 1).</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">By company</strong>: This result is normally used to report the overall cybersecurity level of an organization to corporate executives (C-level). Again, this is especially useful for justifying a budget request to improve any of the domains.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The following figure illustrates an example of the results shown by company. Notice how easily<a id="_idIndexMarker447"/> you can determine that the company invested heavily in <strong class="bold">Access Control</strong> and <strong class="bold">Network Security</strong>, but also how some other critical components need attention and should be prioritized in the next budget:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_3.13_B16290.jpg" alt="Figure 3.13 – Graphical results of the implementation of ECM2&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.13 – Graphical results of the implementation of ECM2</p>
			<p>I know what you are thinking, and <em class="italic">YES</em>: the results of ECM2 are a great tool that you can leverage when requesting a budget for cybersecurity and also to support your numbers and future investments.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-85"><a id="_idTextAnchor088"/>Advantages of a CMM</h2>
			<p>Now, let me <a id="_idIndexMarker448"/>summarize some additional benefits of implementing ECM2. </p>
			<p>The following are management advantages:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Clear understanding of the real status of the company/organization in regard to cybersecurity.</li>
				<li>Better understanding of cybersecurity best practices.</li>
				<li>The results can be used as a great benchmarking tool.</li>
				<li>Easy identification of cybersecurity risks.</li>
				<li>Provides visibility to the risk scenario and exposure level of a company.</li>
				<li>Supports investment in cybersecurity initiatives.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The following are financial advantages:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Helps you create a better (smarter) cybersecurity budget</li>
				<li>Helps you identify critical areas of investment required to improve your cybersecurity program</li>
				<li>Helps you to<a id="_idIndexMarker449"/> identify the <strong class="bold">return of investment</strong> (<strong class="bold">ROI</strong>) on cybersecurity initiatives</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The following are operative advantages:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Smart assignment of resources for cybersecurity</li>
				<li>Provides a clear guideline to understand the most vulnerable areas in cybersecurity</li>
				<li>Reduces <em class="italic">waste</em> in resources and efforts related to cybersecurity tasks</li>
				<li>Provides a better understanding of the company strategy in terms of cybersecurity</li>
				<li>Helps to promote a<a id="_idTextAnchor089"/> cybersecurity culture in your organization<p class="callout-heading">Tip</p><p class="callout">Do you want to <a id="_idIndexMarker450"/>know more about ECM2? If so, visit <a href="http://www.ecm2.info">www.ecm2.info</a>.</p></li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-86"><a id="_idTextAnchor090"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>By now, you should know the value of having cybersecurity policies and procedures in place and the importance of investing time and resources in creating them.</p>
			<p>You learned how to implement the CUDSE method to create and manage cybersecurity policies and procedures like a pro! You then expanded your knowledge of compliance and learned how to achieve and manage it.</p>
			<p>However, staying compliant requires assessment, so you also expanded your knowledge on the different types of audits and how to deal with them. </p>
			<p>But since audits are complex and expensive, you learned about a great tool to perform a self-evaluation of your cybersecurity level in a faster, easier, and more effective way, with the implementation of ECM2.</p>
			<p>In the next chapter, we will see a series of systems, tools, and techniques to deal with the most challenging, complex, and vulnerable layer of any IT infrastructure: Layer 8, also known as the Users layer!</p>
