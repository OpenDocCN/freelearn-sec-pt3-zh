These are the systems that we wear and that support us in building and running cities, companies, our personal online shopping tours, and our friendships. These systems are attractive to use—and abuse. Consequently, all criminal fields such as theft, fraud, blackmailing, and so on expanded to the IT. Nowadays, this is a multi-billion, criminal, global shadow industry.</p><p>Can a single person spot traces of criminal or suspicious activity conducted by a multi-billion, criminal, global shadow industry? Well, sometimes you can. To analyze the modern crime, you do not need magnifying glasses and lifting fingerprints off wine bottles. Instead, we will see how to apply your Python skills to get a close look at the most promising spots on a file system and take digital fingerprints from the traces left behind by hackers.</p><p>As authors, we believe in the strength of examples over dusty theory. This is why we provide samples for forensic tooling and scripts, which are short enough to be understood by the average Python programmer, yet usable tools and building blocks for real-world IT forensics.</p><p>Are you ready to turn <span class="emphasis"><em>suspicion</em></span> into hard facts?</p><div class="section" title="What this book covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>
<a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Setting Up the Lab and Introduction to Python ctypes">Chapter 1</a>,<span class="emphasis"><em> Setting Up the Lab and Introduction to Python ctypes</em></span>, covers how to set up your environment to follow the examples that are provided in this book. We will take a look at the various Python modules that support our forensic analyses. With ctypes, we provide the means to go beyond Python modules and leverage the capabilities of native system libraries.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Forensic Algorithms">Chapter 2</a>,<span class="emphasis"><em> Forensic Algorithms</em></span>, provides you with the digital equivalent of taking fingerprints. Just like in the case of classic fingerprints, we will show you how to compare the digital fingerprints with a huge registry of the known good and bad samples. This will support you in focusing your analysis and providing a proof of forensical soundness.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. Using Python for Windows and Linux Forensics">Chapter 3</a>,<span class="emphasis"><em> Using Python for Windows and Linux Forensics</em></span>, is the first step on your journey to understanding digital evidence. We will provide examples to detect signs of compromise on Windows and Linux systems. We will conclude the chapter with an example on how to use machine learning algorithms in the forensic analysis.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Using Python for Network Forensics">Chapter 4</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Using Python for Network Forensics</em></span>, is all about capturing and analyzing network traffic. With the provided tools, you can search and analyze the network traffic for signs of exfiltration or signature of malware communication.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. Using Python for Virtualization Forensics">Chapter 5</a>,<span class="emphasis"><em> Using Python for Virtualization Forensics</em></span>, explains how modern virtualization concepts can be used by the attacker and forensic analyst. Consequently, we will show how to find traces of malicious behavior on the hypervisor level and utilize the virtualization layer as a reliable source of forensic data.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Using Python for Mobile Forensics">Chapter 6</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Using Python for Mobile Forensics</em></span>, will give you an insight on how to retrieve and analyze forensic data from mobile devices. The examples will include analyzing Android devices as well as Apple iOS devices.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. Using Python for Memory Forensics">Chapter 7</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Using Python for Memory Forensics</em></span>, demonstrates how to retrieve memory snapshots and analyze these RAM images forensically with Linux and Android. With the help of tools such as LiME and Volatility, we will demonstrate how to extract information from the system memory.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="What you need for this book"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec03"/>What you need for this book</h1></div></div></div><p>All you need for this book is a Linux workstation with a Python 2.7 environment and a working Internet connection. <a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Setting Up the Lab and Introduction to Python ctypes">Chapter 1</a>,<span class="emphasis"><em> Setting Up the Lab and Introduction to Python ctypes</em></span>, will guide you through the installation of the additional Python modules and tools. All of our used tools are freely available from the Internet. The source code of our samples is available from Packt Publishing.</p><p>To follow the examples of <a class="link" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. Using Python for Virtualization Forensics">Chapter 5</a>,<span class="emphasis"><em> Using Python for Virtualization Forensics</em></span>, you may want to set up a virtualization environment with VMware vSphere. The required software is available from VMware as time-limited trial version without any functional constraints.</p><p>While not strictly required, we recommend trying some of the examples of <a class="link" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Using Python for Mobile Forensics">Chapter 6</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Using Python for Mobile Forensics</em></span>, on discarded mobile devices. For your first experiments, please refrain from using personal or business phones that are actually in use.</p></div>
<div class="section" title="Who this book is for"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec04"/>Who this book is for</h1></div></div></div><p>This book is for IT administrators, IT operations, and analysts who want to gain profound skills in the collection and analysis of digital evidence. If you are already a forensic expert, this book will help you to expand your knowledge in new areas such as virtualization or mobile devices.</p><p>To get the most out of this book, you should have decent skills in Python and understand at least some inner workings of your forensic targets. For example, some file system details.</p></div>
<div class="section" title="Conventions"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec05"/>Conventions</h1></div></div></div><p>In this book, you will find a number of text styles that distinguish between different kinds of information. Here are some examples of these styles and an explanation of their meaning.</p><p>Code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles are shown as follows: "Note that in the case of Windows, <code class="literal">msvcrt</code> is the MS standard C library containing most of the standard C functions and uses the <code class="literal">cdecl</code> calling convention (on Linux systems, the similar library would be <code class="literal">libc.so.6</code>)."</p><p>A block of code is set as follows:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">def multi_hash(filename):
    """Calculates the md5 and sha256 hashes
       of the specified file and returns a list
       containing the hash sums as hex strings."""</pre></div><p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">&lt;Event &gt;&lt;System&gt;&lt;Provider Name="Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing" Guid="54849625-5478-4994-a5ba-3e3b0328c30d"&gt;&lt;/Provider&gt;
