    a serious security vulnerability.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker needs to *mimic* one of those *trusted*
    Wi-Fi **access points** (**AP**) so that the victim device will automatically
    connect to it. But the question is, how does the attacker know the name of the
    trusted networks on the victim's device? Well, here is where the clever attack
    starts.
  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'When your device (laptop, smartphone, and so on) has Wi-Fi turned *on* and
    it is not connected to any network, it will broadcast **Probe Request Frames**
    (**PRFs**), which contain the list of SSIDs that your device trusts. Those frames
    are captured by AP that review them and see whether their SSID is on the list;
    if so, it will start the connection process:'

    *probe requests are not encrypted*, captures them, and reads the list of trusted
    and open SSIDs.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Then the device automatically creates an open AP (with no password) and uses
    the name of one of the trusted and open SSIDs. At this point, the victim's device
    will connect immediately to it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now that the victim's device is connected to the **rogue access point**, the
    attacker can execute a plurality of attacks, including the famous **man-in-the-middle
    attack**, which will be discussed in detail in [*Chapter 8*](B16290_08_Final_JC_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor193),
