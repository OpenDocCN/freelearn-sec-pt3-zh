- en: After focusing on the fundamentals of incident response that are critical to
    any information security team, you’ll move on to exploring the incident response
    framework. From understanding its importance to creating a swift and effective
    response to security incidents, the book will guide you with the help of useful
    examples. You’ll later get up to speed with digital forensic techniques, from
    acquiring evidence and examining volatile memory to hard drive examination and
    network-based evidence. All of these techniques will be applied to the current
    threat of ransomware. As you progress, you’ll discover the role that threat intelligence
    plays in the incident response process. You’ll also learn how to prepare an incident
    response report that documents the findings of your analysis. Finally, in addition
    to various incident response activities, the book will address malware analysis
    and demonstrate how you can proactively use your digital forensic skills in threat
    hunting.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 1*](B18571_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor013), *Understanding Incident Response*,
    covers how an understanding of the foundational elements of incident response
    is critical to any information security team. Without an understanding of how
    to address the phases of incident response, individual personnel and organizations
    will not be able to craft an efficient and effective response to security incidents.
    This chapter will focus on the critical aspects of incident response that will
    provide you with that solid foundation.'

- en: '[*Chapter 2*](B18571_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor028), *Managing Cyber Incidents*,
    explores the pressing issue of how to execute the planning and preparation in
    an actual incident, as [*Chapter 1*](B18571_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor013) provided
    the foundation of incident response. Drawing on critical incident management techniques,
    you will be guided through the critical components of managing a cyber security
    incident from the beginning where the incident is detected through the remediation
    and recovery that brings the organization’s IT system back to operation.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 3*](B18571_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor046), *Fundamentals of Digital Forensics*,
    focuses heavily on proper evidence-handling procedures. A significant portion
    of the response to an incident is the ability to properly acquire, analyze, and
    report on that analysis. Digital forensics, like any forensic discipline, requires
    a solid understanding of the technical, legal, and operational requirements. A
    lack of this understanding, such as proper evidence handling can cause evidence
    to become tainted or otherwise unusable.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 4*](B18571_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor061), *Investigation Methodology*,
    presents a sound investigation methodology and intrusion analysis framework to
    ensure that intrusions and other cyber attacks are properly investigated. Digital
    forensics and incident response is the overall process for an organization to
    properly address a cyber attack. The digital forensics investigation methodology
    is a systematic way to investigate cyber attacks that integrates into the overall
    incident response process.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 5*](B18571_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor084), *Collecting Network Evidence*,
    explains that the first step in digital forensics is data acquisition. One major
    source of data is contained within network traffic. With today’s complex networks,
    various devices can send detailed information about connections, sessions, and
    in some cases, complete reconstructions of files sent over network connections.
    Properly acquiring this evidence can provide valuable data points to reconstruct
    an incident.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 6*](B18571_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor105), *Acquiring Host-Based Evidence*,
    guides you through how to acquire host evidence in a forensically sound manner.
    Incidents rarely involve an attack against only network hardware. Adversaries
    routinely attack hosts to establish a foothold, stage further tools for attacks,
    and finally, move to other systems. When they do this, they will often leave traces
    through log files, code in memory, or other traces.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 7*](B18571_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor123), *Remote Evidence Collection*,
    presents a solution and scenarios to demonstrate the capabilities of remote forensic
    evidence collection. The focus of the previous chapters has been on localized
    evidence collection. While this approach is forensically sound, the challenge
    is that it does not scale for large enterprises where hundreds or possibly thousands
    of endpoints may be in-scope of an incident. This requires the deployment of specialized
    tools and techniques to gather and search for evidence across the enterprise.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 8*](B18571_08.xhtml#_idTextAnchor136), *Forensic Imaging*, guides
    you through how to acquire and verify a forensic image of either a logical drive
    or partition or, in some cases, the entire physical drive. While there is a good
    deal of evidence acquired through the previous chapter, there often come incidents
    where a complete examination of the filesystem and associated storage is needed.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 9*](B18571_09.xhtml#_idTextAnchor156), *Analyzing Network Evidence*,
    focuses on the analysis of digital evidence, having addressed the acquisition
    of network evidence in a previous chapter. The primary focus will be on reconstructing
    data found in packet captures as well as the analysis of Command and Control traffic.
    Finally, taking this data and correlating it with other log files to determine
    the potential root cause will be addressed.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 10*](B18571_10.xhtml#_idTextAnchor173), *Analyzing System Memory*,
    examines the various aspects of analyzing system memory with an eye on identifying
    the root cause. There is a maxim in digital forensics that states, “Malware can
    hide but it has to run.” While a bit simplistic, it does point to one key facet
    of digital forensics – that is, the memory on a compromised system contains a
    good deal of evidence. This is also becoming more of a concern as memory-only
    malware and other exploits gain a foothold.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 11*](B18571_11.xhtml#_idTextAnchor188), *Analyzing System Storage*,
    allows you to take the evidence collected in the previous chapter, extract the
    pertinent data, and analyze it with the intent of determining the root cause of
    the compromise. Much like memory, there is often a good deal of evidence to be
    analyzed on the system’s storage.'

- en: '[*Chapter 12*](B18571_12.xhtml#_idTextAnchor204), *Analyzing Log Files*, guides
    you through analyzing logs using a variety of open source tools. The Windows operating
    system has several separate log files that log a variety of activities on the
    Windows system. This includes events such as logons, PowerShell use, and events
    associated with executing processes. These log sources are invaluable as a source
    of evidence.'

- en: '[*Chapter 13*](B18571_13.xhtml#_idTextAnchor220), *Writing the Incident Report*,
    shows the critical elements of an incident report. Reporting the findings of the
    analysis of data and the sequence of events is a critical component of incident
    response. This chapter covers the various audiences that need to be addressed,
    how to prepare the technical reports, and how to properly debrief the stakeholders
    of an organization.'

    Response*, provides an overview of ransomware and the necessary steps to prepare
    for such an incident. Over the last few years, ransomware has become the number
    one threat to organizations. The relative ease of carrying out such attacks is
    dwarfed by the impact such attacks have on an organization. Properly preparing
    and handling such incidents is critical to bring operations back to normal to
    minimize downtime.'

    builds on your understanding of ransomware by focusing on specific investigation
    steps. This will be a technical deep dive into the tools and techniques that are
    commonly leveraged by ransomware threat actors with a focus on initial access,
    credential theft, lateral movement, and command and control.'

    Response*, guides you through various techniques to examine malicious code and
    leverage malware data in an incident. When examining incidents, especially those
    in the last 5 years, most of them involve malware as an initial attack to gain
    access to a system. While many malware variants are well known, there is also
    the potential for new malicious code to be found on systems involved in an incident.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 17*](B18571_17.xhtml#_idTextAnchor304), *Leveraging Threat Intelligence*,
    explores threat intelligence and how you can leverage this data prior to and during
    an incident. In the last decade, data and intelligence about threat actors, their
    methods, and the signs of their attacks have become more available to organizations
    outside of the government. While this information can be leveraged, many organizations
    do not have the necessary skills or knowledge to leverage threat intelligence
    properly.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 18*](B18571_18.xhtml#_idTextAnchor323), *Threat Hunting*, guides
    you through the practice of threat hunting, the methodology, and finally, how
    to integrate many of the skills presented in the previous chapters in a proactive
    manner. Threat hunting, the practice of using digital forensic techniques in a
    proactive manner to identify previously unidentified threats, is a practice that
    is currently gaining traction in many organizations.'
