                    <h1 class="header-title">Networking, Mentoring, and Shadowing</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>To ensure that you have a smooth start to, and progress through, your career, there are three essential processes that you can follow. These are <strong>mentoring</strong>, <strong>shadowing</strong>, and <strong>networking</strong>. Mentoring involves a one-to-one relationship between you and a professional who can give you timely advice, motivation, and direction. Shadowing involves going to the workplace with a professional attitude and observing what they do. This allows you to discover more about the career you intend to pursue by watching what actually takes place in a normal workday. Lastly, networking involves building professional links with other people within, and outside, your line of work. Networking helps you get information, guidance, and support from others when it comes to developing your career, or switching from one career to another. This chapter will discuss the importance of these three essentials in your career in the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mentoring</li>
<li>Networking</li>
<li>Shadowing</li>
</ul>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Mentoring</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Mentorship is important both in your education and career. There is always the excitement of getting things done all by yourself so that you can attribute all the success to yourself. Getting a job all by yourself is a significant achievement. Planning your career development all by yourself is also a significant achievement, or so it seems. However, the reality is quite different from expectations. You might have the best of ideas, but not actually know how to execute them. Your plan for growing in your career might not exactly fall into place in real life. Your expectations of getting a job by merely spending hours on job boards, applying for positions that you are qualified for, might not go as you expected. This is why you need a mentor to give you guidance and, also, to monitor the steps that you take. Mentoring is a one-to-one relationship where you seek the continued support and advice of a more experienced professional to guide you through any stage of career development. The following is a detailed list of the reasons why mentors are necessary to one's career life:</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">They provide knowledge and wisdom</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The best mentors, as we shall see later in the chapter, are professionals that have lengthy experience in their fields. They tend to have lots of knowledge that someone starting his or her career would benefit from. For instance, a mentor will be best placed to tell you the right programming languages and frameworks to learn. From a beginner's perspective, the best languages and frameworks are those fetching most money in the market. Programmers who have been working in the field for a long time know how hyped up languages and frameworks end up. Therefore, they might tell you to focus on other languages and frameworks. The same goes for many other professions. Besides this, you can tap into their wealth of knowledge. You can approach a mentor when you are faced with dilemmas or hard choices to make and they will help you make the best decisions.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">They give insights on where you should improve</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Mentors are good at identifying faults that you may have overlooked. These faults might be in your projects, your decisions, your execution, or your plans. You may have downplayed these faults assuming that they would not have any significant impact on your personal or career development. Mentors will be brutally honest and tell you that you need to correct areas where you have had faults. This is how you get to improve. Constructive criticism from mentors often helps people attain most of their goals as they will have eliminated the faults that were preventing them from being successful. Without a mentor, you rely on self-criticism which is, at times, deceptive, as it leads you to think that you are better or worse than you actually are. Mentors will give you a true reflection of yourself and tell you what you can do to improve.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">They give encouragement</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Your career path might not be as smooth as you had imagined or planned. Sometimes you will face challenges and you will be on the brink of quitting. Without any motivation, you will decide to quit, take a break, or forfeit your success. Mentors come with encouragement that can keep you going. Oprah Winfrey, an inspirational entrepreneur, defined a mentor as <em>"someone that allows you to see the hope inside yourself."</em> A mentor's principal concern in your engagement is to ensure that you achieve your goals and, when you are almost caving in, they are there to get you back up. Therefore, mentors will hardly let you stop, and, when you are facing the most challenging of obstacles, they will encourage you to keep going, and give guidance on how you should do that.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Mentors create boundaries and ensure discipline</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Taking charge of your life or career is a huge responsibility and you must be committed to it. However, you will naturally try to give yourself a break or follow the least cumbersome path to success. You will also run into many distractions. These distractions, taking unnecessary breaks, or looking for shortcuts, might delay your success. This is why mentors have a strict sense of discipline and create boundaries in respect of what you can or cannot do. These are what help create a solid work ethic, unshaken focus, and help you set your priorities in the right way.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Mentors give unfiltered opinions</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>You will have very many ideas which will convincingly sound achievable to you and others. However, mentors view such ideas from different perspectives. Based on their observations from the different perspectives, mentors can give their honest opinions regarding the viability of your ideas. Mentors can help you identify ideas that have potential in the long term so that you can act on them. For instance, if you want to learn a new framework at an inflated cost just because there are openings paying attractive salaries, a mentor could advise you on whether you should commit to learning the language. It could simply be a wave passing, and, after a year of learning the framework, a new one could be released rendering you jobless. These insights might be lacking in your decision making, and that is why you should consult your mentor before committing.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">They are trustworthy advisers</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>When working on sensitive projects, especially those that involve proprietary information, it becomes hard to trust anyone but yourself. Sharing such information, or even ideas, with the wrong people can lead to duplication of the product that you plan on making. Therefore, there is a challenge when you have to ask another party to give you fresh ideas or new insights into what you are working on. Mentors act as third parties without any stake in your ideas and will be happy to share with you their advice on sensitive projects. However, you should still exercise caution in what you divulge to others. Mentors will hardly sell out your ideas or steal proprietary information that you share with them confidentially.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">They can be good connectors</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>As will be discussed later in the chapter, there is a lot of value in professional connections. Mentors will often be willing to give you access to professionals in the industry who can provide some support for what you are doing, or aiming to achieve. Mentors can take you to events, introduce you to opportunities, or link you with recognized professionals that you would otherwise never meet.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">They have lengthy experience that you can learn from</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Mentors often have a lot of experience that you can learn from. They have been in your shoes, they have made informed decisions, they have made mistakes, and they have learned from the school of experience. With a mentor, you do not have to go through the same challenges they went through, or make the same mistakes they did. They will share with you their stories and their mistakes so that you do not have to repeat them. They will also share with you the wise decisions or sacrifices they made to achieve something big.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Mentors are satisfied by your success</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Mentors, unlike many other professionals, are not in your life just to enrich themselves. Mentors are free; thus, they are not motivated by financial gains from you. Mentors derive satisfaction from watching you succeed. They will, therefore, be willing to support you and connect you with professionals in your industry. Some people who end up being successful after several tries want to help others become successful, through mentoring.</p>
<p>The list of benefits that come from having a mentor is long. You can have the best ideas or plans, but, during execution, you might need someone who has done something similar before to give you insights about the mistakes to avoid and the decisions to make at each stage. You could be hitting a snag with each idea or project you have, just because you do not have someone else to guide you. Having looked at the importance of having a mentor, you ought to understand how to choose one and the following section gives tips on how to do it.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">How to choose a mentor</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Mentors are the reasons behind the success of many people. However, not every mentor will take you to success, and that is why, before approaching them, you should consider a few things. The following are what you should look for:</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Compatibility</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>You should look for a mentor that you can work with comfortably without strain. Your first few interactions with potential mentors should be used as an opportunity to gauge whether you are compatible with them. If there is a sense of discomfort or a conflict of ideals, it is best not to take the mentorship relationship any further. If the mentor is assigned by a company, you can request for them to be changed.</p>
<p>To gauge your compatibility with a mentor, you should look at their worldviews, ideals, and philosophies. Their views or ideals might not be the same as yours, but they should be reasonable. You should avoid people that demonstrate signs of extremism in their views, as they might end up enslaving your personality to follow one strict path. You should also avoid mentors who have stark differences with you that might get in the way of the two of you working together. You should not try and force the mentorship relationship: follow your instincts. When you feel that you might end up getting into a long-term conflict with the mentor, it is best to cut off links with them.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">The mentor's strengths and weaknesses</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>You will be looking for someone to emulate, and this is why you should look at their strengths and weaknesses. Mentors that have too many weaknesses could have a negative effect on you. It is never good to have to spend too much energy trying to accommodate the weaknesses of a mentor. However, you should also consider that no one is perfect and a few flaws are acceptable. Some important qualities you should pay attention to when assessing a mentor are their empathy, honesty, timekeeping, dedication, and their listening skills. Listening skills, particularly, are of great importance, as much of the time that you will be interacting with the mentor will involve you presenting your challenges to them. If the mentor never lends listening ears, it is probably best to highlight this to them or cut off the mentorship ties with them.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Contrast</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Previously, we mentioned that you should look for a mentor you are compatible with. However, you ought to know that you need a mentor who is outside your comfort zone. Your mentor should not be based on your best friend's traits. You need someone that contrasts with you so as to encourage you to step out of your comfort zone. For instance, if you are poor at timekeeping, you need a mentor who is strict on time because this will push you to start trying to keep time. Therefore, you should be open to having a mentor who thinks or acts differently, provided that their traits will help you move out of your comfort zone. You should also be open to being mentored by someone outside your industry. If you are a web developer, a football coach could still be your mentor. Such a person has a different outlook on life than someone within your professional circles and will look at your challenges from a different perspective as would another programmer.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Expertise</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>In mentorship, titles or years of experience do not matter, but expertise does. The best choice for a mentor is someone who has gone through different challenges, or has had several experiences that you can learn from. You cannot be assured that, simply because someone holds a high office in a particular organization, they will make a great mentor. They could have gotten to such positions without facing major obstacles, or by being pulled up by someone influential. You would be better off having an armed forces veteran as your mentor or someone that has overcome many life challenges to get to where they are today. Their experience will be helpful to you and you will learn from it.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Trust</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>We had mentioned that mentors are trustworthy with confidential information, but you have to do your part in finding a mentor that is trustworthy. Mostly, you will end up sharing with your mentor some information in confidence. Therefore, it is best if you can trust them. Trust has to be two-way and you should trust your mentor just as much as they trust you. To avoid getting in unwanted scenarios where you share sensitive information with the wrong person, it is best to take your relationship with the mentor slowly. You should take time building up some ground rules on how you will interact with your mentor, and, after several sessions, you will learn whether the mentor is trustworthy. The mentor will also find you sufficiently trustworthy to share with you their own personal information.</p>
<p>These factors to consider while seeking out a mentor will help you to find someone trustworthy, reliable and best-placed to help you grow. Once you are in a good relationship with your mentor, you must make the most out of it and grow your career, or move closer to achieving your life goals. After you have found a good mentor, you should be curious, and ready to leave your comfort zone; you should be honest, appreciate feedback or constructive criticism, and ensure that there is mutual respect between the two of you. The next section looks at yet another important part of your professional life: networking.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Networking</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Networking is the building of relationships that help you get information, guidance, and support in your career. Networking has proven benefits of helping one advance more quickly in your career, get better compensation for your skills, develop career mobility, and get more satisfaction from your work life. Networking can be said to be social capital. The more people that you have in your network, the more social capital you have. This capital can be used to get information, opportunities, exposure, more networks, and long-term support in your career. With social capital, you can also advance and develop your career more quickly. An effective network must be built with certain considerations to ensure that you derive maximum social capital from it. The two most important considerations are network size and composition. Network size involves the number of contacts that you have. These contacts determine the opportunities that you have access to from your network. However, network size alone is not sufficient to give you enough social capital to grow your career as you could have many low-level contacts. This is why network composition is the most important factor in your network. Network composition is simply the type of people that make up your network. It is important to ensure that your network has contacts from different social environments, demographics and organizational statuses. Social environments or contexts include colleagues at your workplace, family members, and communities, among others. It is good to build a network with a mix of different social environments. This improves your chances of getting opportunities passed to, or shared, with them. Having contacts from different demographics plays a big role in opening you up for careers in distant places. Your current location might be saturated with people who have the same skills as you, but overseas there might be an acute lack of people with such skill sets. A diverse demographic network helps you get such opportunities, and this could accelerate your career development. Lastly, contacts with different organizational statuses are important in your network. If you only have contacts holding executive statuses, you can get promotions or well-paying jobs. If you have contacts with lower organizational statuses, you get many opportunities passed to you that you could apply for. There are benefits of having contacts that hold junior, middle, and senior level jobs.</p>
<p>Networking is vital to your career growth and ensures that you build reputable relations over a period of time. The following are some of the benefits of networking: </p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Job opportunities</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The contacts in a network help in starting or building your career. The contacts could be HR personnel, individuals working in organizations with job vacancies, or executives in organizations. Such contacts could help you to get jobs easily, with minimal struggle. There is a statistic that 80% of jobs are not advertised on job boards. Therefore, relying on applying for jobs from sites such as <strong>indeed</strong> is not as nearly effective as having contacts who can inform you when there are job vacancies. While other job seekers are competing for the 20% of the jobs posted on job boards, you stand a better chance of landing jobs passed to you by contacts that work in the organization with the vacancy. A network can also be helpful in getting jobs that are outside your locale. As discussed before, there could be places that have a shortage of a skillset; as a result, they will be willing to not only hire, but compensate more, someone from overseas. For instance, there might be a non-profit organization working in a remote place in Africa which cannot find a reliable local developer skilled in a certain framework. If you have a contact within the country, they could offer you the job with several perks. Lastly, contacts within your network can serve as good referrals if you get job interviews within organizations that they work for. This significantly increases your chances of getting hired.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Career advice and support</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Your network contacts who have lengthy stays in particular industries are a source of valuable career advice and support. They can give you advice at every stage of your career and support you as they grow. Without this advice, you could follow a potentially dangerous career path that will not lead you to better opportunities. For instance, you could make the mistake of staying in one company that continually abuses and unfairly compensates you, due to a lack of advice from experienced people, that there is a point at which you have to switch employers. You can also stay in a career with limited growth prospects, and a contact that has been in the same shoes could give advice on whether you should try a career change. It is very easy to get stuck in an unpromising career while there are other opportunities. Your professional network can help prevent such a scenario, through sound career advice and support.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Building confidence</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Growing your network involves meeting new people and engaging them in  conversation, so that you can build a professional relationship with them. Each time you approach a new person to build a new link, you step outside your comfort zone. This allows you to gain confidence and develop essential social skills that will benefit you in your life. The more you go to events, or other places, to meet professionals so that you can build your network, the more confidence you gain. Ultimately, it becomes effortless for you to approach anyone and build a professional relationship with them.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Developing personal relationships</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Some of the strongest and long-lasting relationships are built from your professional contacts. The main goal of building your network is to get professionals that can help you grow your career. However, there are times when these professional relationships develop into something more. This is because it is inevitable that you will stumble upon a contact who shares the same goals and has almost the same mindset. This causes the professional relationship to become a personal relationship. Such a relationship is likely to stay strong for a long period of time.</p>

<p>Your network can be utilized as a source of many resources for career needs. Each contact, if well-utilized, could have something to offer. Some contacts have inside information about organizations that you are applying to for jobs. Other connections can help you polish your CV. There are others that are HRs or executives who can offer you opportunities in their companies. Lastly, there are contacts that will continually send you lists of vacancies that you are qualified for,and possibly link you up with professionals who can help you get the job. In short, there are so many resources that you can harvest from a network. These resources can be used to help with career growth and success.</p>

<p>You can limit your potential by not exploring some paths. However, many people fail to reach their full potential in life because they do not discover things that they can flourish at. With a professional network, you are presented with different types of people that can broaden your mindset. This helps you discover career options that you may not have thought of initially. For instance, a web developer working a 9-5 job in one organization could discover sites that they can work as freelancers and get additional income, or easily get two jobs, and quit the 9-5. Therefore, a professional network serves as a free outlet for new ideas that you can discover and explore. Without the network, you would probably never get to know about the ideas.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Tips for establishing a professional network</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Having taken a look at the benefits of a professional network, it is important to go over the tips for establishing a professional network that can yield one these benefits. Not every professional network will have these advantages, especially if it is not established in a thoughtful way. It is noteworthy that networking where you can meet new professionals, can happen in different ways. Some of these ways include meeting people in person, attending industry events, connecting over social media networks such as LinkedIn, or meeting in public places. These are just a few of the many places where you can engage with others as a professional and add them to your network. The following are some of the tips that you should follow when networking.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Build genuine relationships</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Strong professional networks are established on genuine relationships. Networking is not as simple as approaching a stranger, having a short conversation, and telling them that you want to add them to your professional network. This will likely lead to a superficial network and it will not bear any fruit. When in a scenario where you wish to grow your network, you must first create a genuine relationship with the people you are targeting. You should listen to what they say, add to their talk, reciprocate what they share, and find out their interests and goals. It is best to assume that you are creating a lifelong friendship rather than just aiming to using strangers to gain social capital. You could invite the person you are interacting with to another event, or offer to show them one of your products that matches their interests. If they connect with you in a way that is not superficial, they will most likely be more open to you and give you advice, support, resources, and links, in your professional relationship.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Offer to help</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>You should build relationships in which you are not considered a pest who only wants to gain without offering anything in return. It is good to show support and generosity to other people that you want to connect with. You could ask strangers about the project that they are working on, and, if you have skills that can help them, you should offer to help. You could even recommend someone who can help out if you lack the skills to do so. Therefore, be as ready to offer assistance to others as you are ready to ask others for help. In the process of  asking for help, or offering it to others, you can build a meaningful professional relationship.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Diversify your events</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Events offer some of the best places for linking up with new people who share your interests. For instance, going to a developers' event will help you link with other developers. You can also try going to events that have professionals from other fields. Additionally, you can try improving your chances of meeting even more people by seeking to be a speaker rather than an attendee. For instance, if you have information that some developers could benefit from, you could offer to give a small talk either at the beginning or end of a developers' meeting. Appearing as a speaker at an event improves your credibility in front of others and gets you recognized by many people. This could ease the process of starting conversations with others after the event, and they could become contacts in your network. You might also be sought by other attendees to be in their networks if they enjoyed your presentation. In summary, try attending events that you did not consider previously, and also seek opportunities to appear as one of the speakers during an event.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Keep in touch</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Communication is key in any relationship. Therefore, you should remember to keep in touch with the contacts in your network every once in a while. This is critical in strengthening your relationships, and possibly expanding your network. You could periodically say hello to each and offer to catch up with them in upcoming events if they are willing to attend. Social media is also another way to remain in touch with your network. You should try to have your contacts added as connects on LinkedIn. On LinkedIn, you could periodically send them messages, like their posts, or endorse their skills. This enables you to remain relevant to them and they will also keep you in mind just in case they have opportunities that may benefit you.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Shadowing</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>When starting your career straight from campus, you can opt not to wait till you are on-boarded in an organization, and, instead, follow shadowing. Shadowing is, however, not limited to those joining the workforce. Those that have established careers can do it, probably to learn more about an organization or to get insights about a career they want to switch to. Job shadowing allows those who are already in their careers to test whether another career choice would be ideal for them before they make a bold move to switch careers. Shadowing is a career development process where one accompanies a professional to the workplace and observes what their job entails.</p>
<p>For job seekers that are new in the market and have not joined the workforce,  shadowing allows them to learn more about prospective companies to join. There is a lot that can be learned about companies just through job shadowing. For instance, one can learn about the culture of an organization you want to join when you are within the organization's premises. You can see how employees are treated, how focused each employee is, what employee relationships are like, as well as the overall working atmosphere in the organization. By observing the cultural differences in an organization, you are more informed about the types of workplaces you want to end up in. For instance, through job shadowing, you are able to observe how employees that dress casually differ from those in organizations which are strict and where all employees have to wear suits and ties. The following is a breakdown of the different types of job shadowing:</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Regular briefings</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>This is a type of shadowing that aims to help you learn more about a specific task carried out by employees. Therefore, it involves you shadowing an employee only when carrying out specific activities. For instance, a prospective engineering employee who has just completed campus could go to a site, only when an important task is being carried out. Regular briefings allow you to get a better understanding of roles that are important to these industries. Unlike other types of shadowing, regular briefings require a lot of planning and timing to ensure that the host gets you at the right place and time to observe the specific task being carried out.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Observation</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>This is where you go only to observe what the host or other employees do in a normal workday. This type of job shadowing is passive and you are not normally allowed to try carrying out what you have observed. Observation can happen through attendance at meetings or simply by watching the host and other employees work. Observation is simple and allows you to learn a lot about the organizational culture, work ethics, and work atmosphere in an organization.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Hands-on</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>This is where you are given some tasks to carry out in an actual workplace. It involves observation followed by a hands-on exercise. For instance, you can observe how computers in an organization are dusted off and, after that, you can take a blower and repeat the dusting off process. Hands-on job shadowing is quite risky as inexperienced people can make mistakes when carrying out tasks and these mistakes could financially impact the organization. This is why there are only a few organizations that can offer this. Most organizations will have strict guidelines so that, when you are allowed to carry out some tasks, the financial implications are not significant if an accident occurs.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Preparing for job shadowing</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Job shadowing offers a learning experience that you should take advantage of. The following sections are some of the ways you should prepare for a job shadowing exercise.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Preparing questions beforehand</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Job shadowing allows you to interact with people working in careers that you may wish to take up in the future. Therefore, it is important to prepare some questions in good time that will help paint a better picture of what the host or other employees do, and to help you discover some tips on the skills that you should develop before joining the workplace.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Taking notes</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>There is a lot that can be learned from a job shadowing exercise and it is hard to keep it all in mind. It is therefore handy to have a notebook to take notes of important things said or done in the workplace.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Picking an appropriate time</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>As was discussed above, one type of job shadowing involves regular briefings where a specific task is observed at a certain time and place. It is therefore essential to pick the right time for such a job shadowing exercise. There are other organizations that are seasonal; therefore, you should also ensure that you go during the most convenient times, either when there is a reduced workload and employees can interact more freely, or when there is a full workload when you can see employees working at their peak performance.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Gratitude</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>After attending a job shadowing exercise, it is important to show gratitude to the organization and the host. Therefore, it is advisable to write a thank you note that you will give at the end of the tour, acknowledging that you appreciated the opportunity to learn more about a particular line of work in the organization. The note could also mention the prospects of joining the organization in future through opportunities such as internships.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Summary</h1>
