    last several years and continues to do so at an astounding pace. These smaller
    computing devices are so common, with the ability to replace their desktop counterparts
    in human-to-computer interactions. Sit in any café, airport, or public place that
    offers Wi-Fi and you will see humans with their faces ostensibly glued to their
    device screens, interacting on their device with such focus, seemingly oblivious
    to their own physical environment.

    store our personal and professional secrets. Strangely enough, with little faith,
    we have also begun to allow ourselves to accept backup up of this data to the
    *cloud* so that important aspects of our local device storage are now also in
    *cloud storage*. Why did I mention cloud storage? Cloud backup data can be accessed
    outside of the device itself through other processes, when access to the device
    data itself may be obstructed due to security mechanisms. This book addresses
    *cloud forensics* from the various smartphone platforms.

    in the field of mobile forensics, no one tool can do it all. I know and say this
    from experience because I have used all the tools mentioned in this book. All
    tools have their strengths and limitations. But to be effective, an examiner must
    have at least several tools to cover the broad range of technology in mobile forensics.

    Mobile Forensics*, introduces the concept of mobile devices as a source of valuable
    evidence. The chapter describes what types of evidence are generally available
    in mobile devices. It also outlines acquisition options depending on whether the
    reader has access to the actual device, knows the user’s login and password (such
    as an Apple ID or Google Account password), or has access to the computer that
    was used to sync the mobile device. This chapter also discusses the various techniques
    used by suspects to counter forensic efforts, and suggests methods to overcome
    such efforts. This chapter is essential to understand what, why, and how the expert
    is trying to achieve when investigating mobile devices. After reading this chapter,
    you will understand the big picture of mobile forensics and realize that there
    is no single straightforward path to acquiring mobile evidence, and understand
    that available acquisition options strongly depend on various factors. You’ll
    get an idea of how to seize and store mobile devices and how to detect and counter
    anti-forensic efforts.'

    for all models. Some acquisition methods depend on the phone’s lock and encryption

    In this chapter, the reader will learn what acquisition methods are available
    for the Android platform, which acquisition techniques are available in what circumstances,
    and how to choose the appropriate acquisition method for a given device. This
    chapter also covers one of the most challenging aspects of mobile forensics: the
    ability to recover destroyed evidence. In this chapter, we discuss exactly how
    modern smartphones handle deleted data, depending on the operating system (Android,

    manufacturer-specific low-level service modes (LG, Qualcomm, and Mediatek), using
    custom recoveries (CWM, TWRP) for dumping the data partition, making NANDroid

    between encrypted and unencrypted backups are explained, outlining the benefits
    of producing encrypted backups with a known password over unencrypted one. This

    of the sheer diversity of ecosystems, generations of operating systems, devices,

    on something the right tool could accomplish in minutes. There are tens of thousands
    of different device models, and each model can be running a different version
    of the OS or use a different set of OEM or operator customizations, each with
    its own security implications. There are millions of applications, each implementing
    their own way of storing, organizing, and protecting data. It is technically impossible
    for a single expert to know everything. However, it is still possible to learn
    about methods, tools, and techniques to acquire and analyze evidence in most real-life
    situations.

    in a single step, and you risk losing access to evidence, locking down the easier
    acquisition paths, or even permanently destroying the very data you were about
    to access. And even if you succeed in extracting evidence, if you don’t stick
    to the guidelines, the evidence you obtained may not be admissible. This is why
    we’ll cover the entire workflow from seizing a mobile device to acquiring its

    is of great importance to corporate security. However, a passcode lock in a smartphone
    that was used by an ex-employee may become a major problem if the company does
    not store recovery keys for each and every mobile device allowed in the corporate
    network. How do you break into an ex-employee’s passcode-locked iPhone? What can
    you do with a BlackBerry smartphone? Is there a good reason behind not allowing
