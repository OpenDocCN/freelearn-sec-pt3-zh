- en: Backup copy creation is the main method of data extraction from mobile devices
    running BlackBerry OS. On computers running Windows OS, backups of mobile devices
    running BlackBerry OS are created via BlackBerry Desktop Software or BlackBerry
    Link. Backup copies have a `.bbb` extension (in MacOS, backup copies have a `.ipd` extension).

- en: For Windows Phone devices, starting with the x30 series, data extraction via
    the debugging interface (JTAG) is not available, as the test points have been
    removed from their system boards. On the other hand, the In-System Programming
    method became popular, which allows us to solder conductors directly to the memory
    chip on the system board of the mobile device and extract data much faster than
    the data extraction speed via the debug interface (JTAG).

- en: The method of data extraction from integrated memory chips (Chip-off) is a method
    that is used only when other methods did not provide the desired result. It is
    difficult to get the result as encryption of the user partition or lock code installed
    on the memory chip is used in mobile devices running the Windows Phone operating
    system. It is impossible to get access to the data that is stored in the integrated
    memory chip if you do not know the lock code installed on the memory chip.
