    overwhelming. From simple script kiddies using off-the-shelf code to nation-state
    adversary tools, it is critical to be prepared. For example, an internal employee
    can download a single instance of ransomware and that can have a significant impact
    on an organization. More complex attacks, such as a network exploitation attempt
    or a targeted data breach, increase the chaos that a security incident causes.
    Technical personnel will have their hands full attempting to determine which systems
    have been impacted and how they are being manipulated. They will also have to
    contend with addressing the possible loss of data through compromised systems.
    Adding to this chaotic situation are senior managers haranguing them for updates
    and an answer to the all-important questions: *How did this happen?* *Was this
    a web server vulnerability or a phishing email that led to lateral movement?*
    Management also wants to know: *How bad is it?* *Is the damage limited to the
    web server or is a large portion of the network compromised?*'

    efficient manner allows organizations to both limit the damage of a potential
    cyber attack and also recover from the associated damage that is caused. To facilitate
    this orderly response, organizations of all sizes have looked at adding an **incident
    response** (**IR**) capability to their existing policies, procedures, and processes.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    must be addressed. First, organizations need to have a working knowledge of the
    IR process. This process outlines the general flow of an incident and general
    actions that are taken at each stage. Second, organizations need to have access
    to personnel who form the nucleus of any IR capability. Once a team is organized,
    a formalized plan and associated processes need to be created. This written plan
    and processes form an orderly structure that an organization can follow during
    an incident. Finally, with this framework in place, the plan must be continually
    evaluated, tested, and improved as new threats emerge. Utilizing this framework
    will position organizations to be prepared for the unfortunate reality that many
    organizations have already faced, an incident that compromises their security.

    If the organization has a mature IR capability, it will have taken measures to
    ensure it is prepared to address an incident at each stage of the process. Each
    incident starts with the first time the organization becomes aware of an event
    or series of events indicative of malicious activity. This detection can come
    in the form of a security control alert or an external party informing the organization
    of a potential security issue. Once alerted, the organization moves through analyzing
    the incident through containment measures to bring the information system back
    to normal operations. There is no set IR process. One standard that is widely
    used is the **National Institute of Standards and Technology** (**NIST**) IR process.
    The following diagram, taken from the NIST **Special Publication** (**SP**) *800-61*
    shows how the NIST process flows in a cycle, with **preparation** as the starting
    point. A closer examination reveals that every incident is used to better prepare
    the organization for future incidents as the **post-incident activity**, and is
    utilized in preparation for the next incident:'

    properly trained. This includes processes, procedures, and any additional tools
    necessary for the investigation of an incident. In addition to a plan, tools such
    as forensics hardware and software should be acquired and incorporated into the

    Depending on the size of the organization, they may have over 100 million separate
    events per day. These events can be records of legitimate actions taken during
    the normal course of business or be indicators of potentially malicious activity.
    Couple this mountain of event data with other security controls constantly alerting
    to activity and you have a situation where analysts are inundated with data and
    must subsequently sift out the valuable pieces of signal from the vastness of
    network noise. Even today’s cutting-edge **Security Information and Event Management**
    (**SIEM**) tools lose their effectiveness if they are not properly maintained
    with regular updates of rulesets that identify which events qualify as a potential
    incident. The detection phase is that part of the IR process where the organization
    first becomes aware of a set of events that possibly indicates malicious activity.
    These events that have been detected and are indicative of malicious behavior
    are then classified as an incident. For example, a security analyst may receive
    an alert that a specific administrator account was in use when the administrator
    was on vacation. Detection may also come from external sources. An **internet
    service provider** (**ISP**) or law enforcement agency may detect malicious activity
    originating in an organization’s network and contact them to advise them of the
    situation. In other instances, users may be the first to indicate a potential
    security incident. This may be as simple as an employee contacting the help desk
    and informing a help desk technician that they received an Excel spreadsheet from
    an unknown source and opened it. They are now complaining that their files on
    the local system are being encrypted. In each case, an organization would have
    to escalate each of these events to the level of an incident (which we will cover
    a little later in this chapter) and begin the reactive process to investigate
    and remediate.'

    or a trusted third party will begin the analysis phase. In this phase, personnel
    begins the task of collecting evidence from systems such as running memory, log
    files, network connections, and running software processes. Depending on the type
    of incident, this collection can take from as little as a few hours to several
    days. Once evidence is collected, it then needs to be examined. There are a variety
    of tools to conduct this analysis, many of which are explored in this book. With
    these tools, analysts attempt to ascertain what happened, what it affected, whether
    any other systems were involved, and whether any confidential data was removed.

    and reconstruct the actions of the threat actor, from initial compromise to detection.'

    actors to continue compromising other network resources, communicating with **command
    and control** (**C2**) infrastructures, or exfiltrating confidential data. Containment
    strategies can range from locking down ports and **Internet Protocol** (**IP**)
    addresses on a firewall to simply removing the network cable from the back of
    an infected machine. Each type of incident involves its own containment strategy,
    but having several options allows personnel to stop the bleeding at the source

    compromised user accounts. If an organization has identified a vulnerability that
    was exploited, vendor patches are applied or software updates are made. Recovery
    activities are very closely aligned with those that may be found in an organization’s
    **business continuity** (**BC**) or **disaster recovery** (**DR**) plans. In this
    phase of the process, organizations reinstall fresh operating systems or applications.
    They will also restore data on local systems from backups. As a due diligence
    step, organizations will also audit their existing user and administrator accounts
    to ensure that no accounts have been enabled by threat actors. Finally, a comprehensive

    during this phase of the process that a written report is completed. Documenting
    the actions taken during the incident is critical to capture both what occurred
    and whether the incident will ever see the inside of a courtroom. For documentation
    to be effective, it should be detailed and show a clear chain of events with a

- en: There is a misconception that is often held by people unfamiliar with the realm
    of IR, which is that IR is merely a digital forensics issue. As a result, they
    will often conflate the two terms. While digital forensics is a critical component
    of IR (and for this reason, we have included a number of chapters in this book
    that address digital forensics), there is more to addressing an incident than
    examining hard drives. It is best to think of forensics as a supporting function
    of the overall IR process. Digital forensics serves as the mechanism for understanding
    the technical aspects of an incident, potentially identifying the root cause,
    and discovering unidentified access or other malicious activity. For example,
    some incidents such as **denial-of-service** (**DoS**) attacks will require little
    to no forensic work. On the other hand, a network intrusion involving the compromise
    of an internal server and C2 traffic leaving the network will require extensive
    examination of logs, traffic analysis, and examination of memory. From this analysis,
    the root cause may be derived. In both cases, the impacted organization would
    be able to connect with the incident, but forensics plays a much more important
    role in the latter case.

    techniques of digital forensics but goes beyond what digital forensics provides
    by addressing additional elements. These elements include containing possible
    malware or other exploits, identifying and remediating vulnerabilities, and managing
    various technical and non-technical personnel. Some incidents may require the
    analysis of host-based evidence or memory while others may only require a firewall
    log review but, in each, the responders will follow the IR process.

    administrator assigned to the CSIRT to examine network traffic between the SQL
    database and the web server. Also, based on the circumstances, the CSIRT analyst
    escalates this to the CSIRT coordinator and informs them of the situation. The
    CSIRT coordinator then begins the process of engaging other CSIRT core teams and
    technical support members to assist.'

    actor has compromised both systems and is in the process of exfiltrating the customer
    database from the internal network. At this point, the CSIRT coordinator identifies
    this as a high-level incident and begins the process of bringing support personnel
    into a briefing. As this incident has involved the compromise of customer data,
    CSIRT support personnel—such as marketing or communications and legal—need to
    become involved. If more resources are required, the CSIRT coordinator will take
    the lead in making that decision.

    have the proper authority and training to call upon resources when needed. The
    escalation procedures should also address the involvement of other personnel outside
    the core CSIRT members, based on the severity of the incident. One of the critical
    functions of escalation procedures is to clearly define which individuals have
    the authority to declare anomalous activity in an incident. The escalation procedures
    should also address the involvement of other personnel outside core CSIRT members,
    based on the severity of the incident.

    of preparing for an incident. From an initial understanding of the process involved
    in IR, we moved through the creation of an IR plan and associated playbooks.

    to flush out any gaps or deficiencies. This exercise should include a high-level
    incident scenario that involves the entire team and one of the associated playbooks.
    A report that details the results of the table-top exercise and any gaps, corrections,
    or modifications should also be prepared and forwarded to senior leadership. Once
    leadership has been informed and acknowledges that the CSIRT is ready to deploy,
    it is now operational.

- en: As the CSIRT becomes comfortable executing the plan under a structured scenario,
    they may want to try more complex testing measures. Another available option is
    the Red/Blue or Purple team exercise. This is where the CSIRT is tasked with responding
    to an authorized penetration test. Here, the team is able to execute against a
    live adversary and test the plans and playbooks. This significantly increases
    the value of the penetration test as it provides an insight into the security
    of the infrastructure as well as the ability of the organization to respond appropriately.

- en: Regardless of the makeup of the team, another key component of CSIRT deployment
    is the inclusion of regular training. For CSIRT core members, specific training
    on emerging threats, forensic techniques, and tools should be ongoing. This can
    be facilitated through third-party training providers or, if available, in-house
    training. The technical support members of the CSIRT should receive regular training
    on techniques and tools available.

    to assist with evidence collection or remediation activities. Finally, other support
    members should be included in the annual test of the IR plan. Just as with an
    inaugural test, the organization should pick a high-level incident and work through
    it using a table-top exercise. Another option for the organization is to marry
    up the testing of their IR plan with a penetration test. If the organization is
    able to detect the presence of the penetration test, they have the ability to
    run through the first phases of the incident and craft a tabletop for the remaining
    portions.

- en: One final component of the ongoing maintenance of an IR plan is a complete annual
    review. This annual review is conducted to ensure that any changes in personnel,
    constituency, or mission that may impact other components of the plan are addressed.
    In addition to a review of the plan, a complete review of the playbooks is conducted
    as well. As threats change, it may be necessary to change existing playbooks or
    add new ones. CSIRT personnel should also feel free to create a new playbook in
    the event of a new threat emerging. In this way, the CSIRT will be in a better
    position to address incidents that may impact their organization. Any major changes
    or additions should also trigger another table-top exercise to validate additional
    plans and playbooks.

- en: 'Benjamin Franklin is quoted as saying: “*By failing to prepare, you are preparing
    to fail*.” In many ways, this sentiment is quite accurate when it comes to organizations
    and the threat of cyber attacks. Preparing for a cyber attack is a critical function
    that must be taken as seriously as any other aspect of cybersecurity. Having a
    solid understanding of the IR process to build on this with an IR capability can
    provide organizations with a measure of preparation so that in the event of an
    incident, they can respond. Keep in mind as we move forward that forensic techniques,
    TI, and reverse engineering are there to assist an organization to get to the
    end—that is, back up and running.'
