			<p>In this book, we will cover various topics within the <strong class="bold">information security</strong> (<strong class="bold">InfoSec</strong>) domain, and help you to translate your organization's strategic requirements into actionable improvements in securing their most valuable assets. </p>
			<p>You can expect to learn about a wide range of InfoSec paradigms, including the foundations of risk management, implementing processes and controls, designing information systems securely, and managing the day-to-day activities required to ensure security is maintained at your organization. </p>

Beyond that, delving deeper into any and all of the topics covered in this book will help you to progress in your career as an InfoSec professional. </p>
