- en: This book will provide you with a clear understanding of digital forensics,
    from its relatively recent emergence as a sub-discipline of forensics to its rapidly
    growing importance alongside the more established forensic disciplines. It will
    enable you to gain a clear understanding of the role of digital forensics practitioners
    and their vital work in cybercrime and corporate environments, where they recover
    evidence of criminal offences and civil transgressions. Examples of real case
    studies of digital crime scenes will help you understand the complexity typical
    of many cases and the challenges digital evidence analysis poses to practitioners.

- en: During the past 10 years or so, there has been a growing interest in digital
    forensics as part of tertiary courses and as a career path in law enforcement
    and corporate investigations. New technologies and forensic processes have developed
    to meet the growing number of cases relying on digital evidence. However, it has
    been apparent that the increasing complexity, size, and number of cases is creating
    problems for practitioners, who also face resource and costing restrictions and
    a shortage of well-trained and experienced personnel. The book will describe these
    challenges and offer some solutions, which hopefully will assist and empower current
    and prospective practitioners to manage problems more effectively in the future.

- en: These are truly exciting and challenging times for practitioners seeking to
    enhance their skills and experience in recovering evidence and assisting the legal
    fraternity in making sense of their important findings. For those wishing to enter
    the discipline, they do so at a time when banality, complacency, and fatigue are
    disappointingly quite common. The enthusiasm of entering the profession can rapidly
    dissipate because of tedium and heavy caseloads, notwithstanding the inherently
    exciting and important nature of the work. Presented in this book are new and
    more effective ways to reduce tedium and time wastage, reinvigorate practitioners,
    and restore the excitement of the hunt for evidence heralded by fresh winds of
    change.

    Need for Enhanced Forensic Tools*, emphasizes the redundancy of conventional forensic
    imaging and the indexing of increasingly larger datasets and introduces new forensic
    processes and tools to assist in sounder evidence recovery and better use of resources.
    The chapter introduces the disruptive technology now challenging established digital
    forensic responses and the overreliance on forensic specialists, who are themselves
    becoming swamped with heavier caseloads and larger, more disparate datasets.'

    its authenticity, relevance, and reliability. Some common pitfalls that diminish
    the admissibility of digital evidence, as well as the evidentiary weight or value
    of evidence, are discussed, as is the need for open-minded and unbiased testing
    and checking of evidence to be a routine matter. The presentation of digital evidence
