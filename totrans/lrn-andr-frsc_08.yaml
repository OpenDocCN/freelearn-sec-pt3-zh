    Carrier. Autopsy started as a graphical user interface for the underlying Linux-based
    SleuthKit toolset, but since version 3, it is a standalone tool built for Windows.
    Autopsy can be downloaded from [http://www.sleuthkit.org/autopsy/](http://www.sleuthkit.org/autopsy/).

    most common Android filesystems (such as YAFFS and EXT). For this example, we
    will load a full physical image obtained via `dd` from a Samsung Galaxy J7.
