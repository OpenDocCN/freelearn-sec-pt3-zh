<div><h1 class="header-title">An introduction to Android malware</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Nowadays, malicious programs are common on any operating system, and mobile devices are no exception. Even such secure devices as those running iOS, iPhones, and iPads, can be infected. A good example is <strong>Pegasus</strong> spyware, which was used to attack Arab human rights defender, Ahmed Mansoor, in 2016. It is able to jailbreak the target device and plant spyware on it, thereby enabling attackers to read a victim's messages, track calls, collect passwords, trace the phone's location, and gather information from different applications. </p>
<p>If we are talking about Android, the situation is even worse. It is easier to install applications from untrusted sources, making it the most malware-affected mobile platform. What's more, security researchers often find lots of malware samples even on the Google Play Store! A good example is the <strong>Android Grabos</strong> campaign, discovered by McAfee in late 2017/early 2018. This campaign pushed unwanted apps onto unsuspecting users—this is commonly known as a pay-per download scam. 144 apps were identified by security researchers and removed from Google Play. But around 17.5 million global smartphone devices had already downloaded those applications before they were removed from the store.</p>
<p>Let's go further now and look at the most common types of Android malware.</p>

<div><h1 class="header-title">Android malware overview</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p> As you may know, different types of malware have different goals, so they have different functionalities as well. Some malicious programs spy on the victim and attempt to steal application data, for example, SMS messages, and emails, while others just show the user unwanted advertisements. This section will introduce you to the most common types of Android malware.</p>


            

            
        
    </div>



  
<div><h1 class="header-title">Banking malware </h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Banking malware is one of the most popular varieties on the Android platform. It can be distributed as fake banking applications to steal banking information typed by the users, or as a third-party application that will steal such info from a genuine one. Also, usually, banking Trojans can intercept banking transactions, and perform actions typical of spyware, such as sending, deleting, and intercepting SMS messages, and keylogging. Some pieces of banking Trojans have even more advanced capabilities. A good example is <strong>MysteryBot</strong>—this can also send spam from the affected device and has ransomware capabilities.</p>


            

            
        
    </div>



  
<div><h1 class="header-title">Spyware</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Spyware monitors, logs, and sends important information from the target device to the attacker's server. This information might be comprised of SMS messages, recorded phone calls, screenshots, keylogs, emails, or any other application data that may be of interest to the attacker. An interesting example is <strong>BusyGasper</strong>, identified by Kaspersky Lab experts in early 2018. It not only possesses common spyware capabilities, such as collecting information from popular messаging applications, such as WhatsApp, Viber, and Facebook, but it also has device sensor listeners, including motion detectors.</p>


            

            
        
    </div>



  
<div><h1 class="header-title">Adware</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Adware is another popular malicious or unwanted application type that is very common on Android devices. It is relatively easy to detect, as the victim will receive continuous popups and ads on their device's screen. Such unwanted programs are not always harmless, since popups may result in the downloading of another piece of malware, including the types already mentioned—spyware and banking Trojans.</p>

<div><h1 class="header-title">Ransomware</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Of course, the main targets of ransomware are desktop Windows-based computers and servers, but it also exists on mobile platforms, and on Android in particular. Usually, it only locks the device screen with a ransom note, but sometimes it encrypts users' data as well. A good example is <strong>WannaLocker </strong>ransomware, which targeted Chinese Android users in 2017, and used AES to encrypt users' files, except those whose names start with <kbd>.</kbd> and files that have <kbd>DCIM</kbd>, <kbd>download</kbd>, <kbd>miad</kbd>, <kbd>android</kbd>, and <kbd>com</kbd>. in their pathname.</p>

<div><h1 class="header-title">Cryptomining malware</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Cryptocurrencies are extremely popular nowadays, so this type of malicious program is available even for mobile platforms, such as Android. The goal of such applications is to mine cryptocurrency, using a victim's device computation capacity, for example, Monero. Occasionally, this type of malware can even put smartphone hardware at risk. For example, <strong>Loapi</strong>, a Trojan with cryptomining capabilities, worked victims' phones so hard that their batteries swelled up in less than 48 hours!</p>
<p>The following section walks you through identifying malicious applications on Android devices.</p>

<div><h1 class="header-title">Android malware identification</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>This section walks you through the process of identifying Android malware in forensic images using antivirus scanners, VirusTotal, and YARA rules.</p>


            

            
        
    </div>



  
<div><h1 class="header-title">Android malware identification using antivirus scanners</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Using antivirus scanners is a typical way to find known pieces of malware, so it's a recommended first step for picking low-hanging fruit. There are a multitude of antivirus scanners, with many of them having free versions that can be used by mobile forensic examiners to complete such tasks. Most of them are Windows-based, so the first step is to mount a previously created physical image so that it will be accessible to the operating system and antivirus scanner.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>As you already know, most Android devices use EXT4 as the filesystem for the most interesting partition from a forensic point of view—the userdata partition. By default, this filesystem isn't supported by Windows, so we need a third-party tool to be able to mount it and, more importantly, in read-only mode, as we don't want the antivirus scanner to delete anything from the image we are going to examine.</p>
<p>Of course, forensic examiners have such a tool available. It's called <em>Linux File Systems for Windows</em>, and its trial version is available for download here: <a href="https://www.paragon-drivers.com/en/lfswin/">https://www.paragon-drivers.com/en/lfswin/</a>. After installation, you are ready to start mounting the userdata partition. You'll need FTK Imager, but you should have it already installed, as we used it in the previous chapters. Here is how to mount an ext4 partition on a Windows host in two simple steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open FTK Imager and go to File | Image Mounting...</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-605 image-border" src="img/b72c30f2-fa90-491e-9020-b47122bd2c00.png" style="width:21.67em;height:13.50em;" width="335" height="209"/></p>
<p>AccessData FTK Imager</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Choose the image file. In our case, it's an Android 9 userdata partition physical image. Choose Physical &amp; Logical as the mount type, Block Device / Read Only as the mount method, and then click the Mount button:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-606 image-border" src="img/8f03e091-3b99-425a-b94f-036702d5b3e2.png" style="width:47.17em;height:49.42em;" width="658" height="689"/></p>
<p>Mounting an EXT4 image with FTK Imager</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">That's it! Now the filesystem is available as logical disk <kbd>E:</kbd> on our Windows 10 host:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-608 image-border" src="img/f38c5744-b3b6-4234-ba87-b042d0b75b98.png" style="width:19.83em;height:35.25em;" width="323" height="574"/></p>
<p>Part of a mounted filesystem, as seen in Windows Explorer</p>
<p>Now it can be easily scanned with an antivirus scanner. Usually, user-installed applications can be found under the <kbd>/data/app</kbd> directory, so it may be a very good idea to start our malware hunting by scanning this folder. For this example, we will use ESET NOD32 antivirus (<a href="https://www.eset.com/int/home/antivirus/">https://www.eset.com/int/home/antivirus/</a>). It has a very interesting option from a forensic point of view—<strong>Scan without cleaning</strong>. This enables an examiner to find a piece of malware, but not delete or quarantine it. To choose it, right-click on your folder of choice, and go to Advanced options. In our case, scanning only took a few seconds, and the result yielded two malicious objects:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-609 image-border" src="img/e6fe3801-cfc8-4dbb-84e2-9f9d7b70a41e.png" style="width:73.67em;height:22.67em;" width="884" height="272"/></p>
<p>Antivirus scan log</p>
<p>As you can see, sometimes, especially if you know where to look, you can find Android malware very quickly and easily using antivirus engines. Of course, the software you are using may not contain corresponding signatures and may miss malicious applications, so it's highly recommended to use multiple engines for scanning.</p>


            

            
        
    </div>



  
<div><h1 class="header-title">Android malware identification using VirusTotal</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>VirusTotal is a free service that can be used to analyze suspicious files and URLs for malware. As you may have noticed, Android applications have an <kbd>.apk</kbd> extension, so if you find a suspicious file, you may want to upload it to VirusTotal to check whether it's actually malicious. Why is this better than scanning with an antivirus scanner? It will scan your file with at least 55 antivirus engines! What's more, you may not want to upload any files from your real cases to the internet, but it's not a problem, as you can search for files that have already been uploaded using their hash sums, MD5, SHA1, or SHA256. This service is available here: <a href="https://www.virustotal.com">https://www.virustotal.com</a>.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>We have already found two malicious files in our Android 9 image, so let's upload one of them to VirusTotal and see how it is detected by other antivirus engines. Go to VirusTotal using a web browser of your choice, and click the Choose file button:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-610 image-border" src="img/02a25991-91ea-4b69-9112-718b6b67baaa.png" style="width:46.42em;height:37.00em;" width="897" height="715"/></p>
<p>VirusTotal interface</p>
<p class="mce-root">If a file's hash is already in the database, you'll immediately be redirected to the page with the results; if not, it will need some time to scan it. In our case, the file's hash has been found immediately, and we see the results:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-611 image-border" src="img/2443dee3-00ac-4a5b-ac79-cb16edafa447.png" style="width:114.67em;height:70.17em;" width="1376" height="842"/></p>
<p>VirusTotal scan results</p>
<p>As you can see, our malware sample has been detected by 29 antivirus engines out of 56 – not bad at all. But what if we didn't want to upload our sample? As previously mentioned, you can use hashes to search for malicious files on VirusTotal.</p>
<p>To obtain a suspicious file's hash sum, you can use Eric Zimmerman's free tool, called Hasher, which is available at <a href="https://ericzimmerman.github.io">https://ericzimmerman.github.io</a>. Now take the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Start the tool, go to Tools - Options, and choose hashing algorithms. In our case, we chose MD5 and SHA256.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>To select the file you want to hash, go to File - Select file, or press <em>Alt</em> + <em>1</em>. You'll see the results in the main window:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-612 image-border" src="img/aac87593-fabc-432a-8edc-697a85d1b3e4.png" style="width:105.08em;height:6.67em;" width="1261" height="80"/></p>
<p>Hashing results</p>
<p>To copy the hash value, click on the corresponding field and press <em>Alt</em> + <em>C</em>. Now you are ready to go to VirusTotal. Click on the Search tab, and paste the hash value:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-613 image-border" src="img/14f6da0d-076b-4fef-9c12-28119f10f86e.png" style="width:43.33em;height:34.58em;" width="898" height="716"/></p>
<p>Searching VirusTotal using hash values</p>
<p>As we used the SHA256 hash sum of the file already scanned by VirusTotal, we will be redirected to the same page. But even if we didn't upload the file, we would get the result, as the file had already been uploaded by a third party.</p>
<p>Sometimes, you have a bunch of files to scan, and it may be a problem to upload them one by one. To upload a bunch of files automatically, you can use VirusTotal Uploader, which is available here: <a href="https://support.virustotal.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002179065-Desktop-Apps">https://support.virustotal.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002179065-Desktop-Apps</a>.</p>
<p>To upload a file or multiple files, click Select file(s) and upload:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-614 image-border" src="img/63432575-4f4c-492b-bba1-3dab0a0546a2.png" style="width:20.08em;height:31.50em;" width="340" height="531"/></p>
<p>VirusTotal Uploader inteface</p>
<p>For demonstration purposes, let's upload the second malicious file we have already identified. Its hash value was found as well, so the tool immediately opened the browser tab containing the scan results:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-615 image-border" src="img/dace1291-1a32-493e-8a91-4a97822218f8.png" style="width:100.08em;height:73.17em;" width="1201" height="878"/></p>
<p>VirusTotal scan results</p>
<p>This file has even better detection results—34 engines out of 60. But what is a forensic examiner going to do if the file isn't detected by any of the antivirus engines as there are no signatures for it? Write your own rules using YARA! You'll learn how to do this in the following section.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>


            

            
        
    </div>



  
<div><h1 class="header-title">Android malware identification using YARA rules</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>According to the official documentation (which can be found at <a href="https://yara.readthedocs.io/en/v3.8.1/">https://yara.readthedocs.io/en/v3.8.1/</a>), YARA is a tool aimed at helping malware researchers (and forensic examiners—both computer and mobile, of course) to identify and classify malware samples. </p>
<p>With the help of YARA, an examiner can write rules based on textual or binary patterns. Here is an example of such a rule:</p>
<pre>rule test_rule<br/>{<br/>   meta:<br/>      description = "Test YARA rule"<br/>      author = "Oleg Skulkin"<br/>   strings:<br/>      $string = "teststring"<br/>   condition:<br/>      $string<br/>}</pre>
<p>This rule will detect any file that contains the <kbd>teststring</kbd> string. Let's look closely at the principal parts of the rule:</p>
<ul>
<li><kbd>meta</kbd>: This part contains the rule's metadata, for example, what exactly it detects, and who wrote it. It may even not be included in the rule.</li>
<li><kbd>strings</kbd>: These are strings that your malware sample must contain in order to be detected. You can use multiple strings or even binary patterns. Strings can be case-sensitive or not, and in ASCII or wide form (two bytes are used to encode a single character), or both.</li>
<li><kbd>condition</kbd>: This contains a Boolean expression telling us under what circumstances a file satisfies the rule. It may be all the strings defined in the <kbd>strings</kbd> section, or a limited number of them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's write a YARA rule to detect a piece of malware we already identified in the previous sections. First of all, we must find unique strings. To be able to do this, let's use another forensic tool from Eric Zimmerman – bstrings: <a href="https://ericzimmerman.github.io/">https://ericzimmerman.github.io/</a>.</p>
<p>This is a command-line tool, so you'll have to run it from the Windows Command Prompt. Use the <kbd>-f</kbd> switch to point to the file you want to extract strings from:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-616 image-border" src="img/aef46ecf-dfae-4611-969e-93c7e19d8f9e.png" style="width:94.75em;height:37.17em;" width="1137" height="446"/></p>
<p>Using bstrings to extract strings from an APK file</p>
<p>An interesting string emerges from the very outset – <kbd>com.example.horsenjnj</kbd>. But how can we determine whether it's unique? A good idea is to search for the string in Google or another available search engine:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-617 image-border" src="img/cbd489ac-3fd8-4a6e-8a47-79ab4fd05674.png" style="width:88.42em;height:30.25em;" width="1061" height="363"/></p>
<p>Google search results</p>
<p>As you can see, there is only one search result, which makes the string we found unique. What's more, if we click the link, it will bring us to the VirusTotal page we already saw in the previous section. </p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>If we scroll the output of strings, we will find more interesting strings, for example, <kbd>res/xml/shit.xml</kbd>– not a very common name for an XML file from application resources. </p>
<p>Let's use two of the strings we have found to write a YARA rule for the detection of our piece of malware. As you may remember from the previous sections, most antivirus engines detected it as Android Banker, so let's call our rule <kbd>android_banker</kbd>. The same can be written in the description—<strong>Detects Android Banker</strong>; we will add this to the <kbd>meta</kbd> section. We have two strings for our rule. Since we don't know how they are encoded, we can add <kbd>ascii wide</kbd> after each of them. The final section—the condition (the file that will be detected by the rule) must contain both strings, so let's use <kbd>all of them</kbd> as the condition.</p>
<p>Here is what we end up with:</p>
<pre>rule android_banker<br/>{<br/>  meta:<br/>     description = "Detects Android Banker"<br/>     author = "Oleg Skulkin"<br/>strings:<br/>     $s1 = "com.example.horsenjnj" ascii wide<br/>     $s2 = "res/xml/shit.xml" ascii wide<br/>condition:<br/>   all of them<br/>}</pre>
<p>To use it, you must save it as a file with the <kbd>.yar</kbd> extension. Now, all you need is a scanner capable of using YARA rules. You can get one here: <a href="https://github.com/virustotal/yara/releases/">https://github.com/virustotal/yara/releases/</a>.</p>
<p>The scanner is another command-line tool. Use the <kbd>-r</kbd> switch to scan a directory of your choice recursively:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-618 image-border" src="img/eaf608a2-2b85-4c0a-96f9-8d05b09049a2.png" style="width:64.42em;height:4.50em;" width="773" height="54"/></p>
<p>Scanning for malware using YARA rules</p>
<p>As you can see from the preceding screenshot, our malware sample was successfully identified by the YARA scanner.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>You can create more complex rules, of course, and the official YARA documentation is a very good reference source. This can be found at <a href="https://yara.readthedocs.io/en/v3.8.1/">https://yara.readthedocs.io/en/v3.8.1/</a>.</p>
