- en: The purpose of this book is to provide you with a clear understanding of digital
    forensics from its relatively recent emergence as a subdiscipline of forensics
    to its rapidly growing importance alongside the more established forensic disciplines.
    This chapter will enable you to gain a clear understanding of the role of digital
    forensic practitioners and the cybercrime and corporate environments, where they
    are actively seeking evidence of crimes and civil offences. A small sample of
    case studies of digital crime scenes will enable you to understand the complexity
    typical of many cases and the challenges posed to the forensic practitioner.

- en: During the past 10 years or so, there has been a growing interest in digital
    forensics as a part of tertiary courses and as a career path in law enforcement
    and corporate investigations. New technologies and forensic processes have developed
    to meet the growing number of cases relying on digital evidence. However, it has
    been apparent that the increasing complexity, size, and number of cases is creating
    problems for practitioners, who also face resource and costing restrictions as
    well as a shortage of well-trained, experienced personnel. The book will describe
    these challenges and offer some solutions that have helped me in my practice and
    research endeavors, and which will hopefully assist and empower current and prospective
    practitioners to manage problems more effectively in the future.

    crime scenes by photographing corpses and other evidence left behind at the scene.
    Bertillon's novel photographic records of crime scenes and his precise cataloging
    and measurement of corpses provided the foundation for the forensic science relating
    to sudden deaths and homicides. It assisted in the identification of the deceased

    assert that no one can act with the force that the criminal act requires without
    leaving behind numerous signs of it: either the wrongdoer has left signs at the
    scene of the crime or, on the other hand, has taken away with him—on his person
    or clothes—indications of where he has been or what he has done.'

    have been used on Chinese legal documents for centuries as a proof of identity
    and the authenticity of the documents. However, it was not until the end of the
    nineteenth century that Edward Henry devised a workable classification system
    and implemented it in India in 1897, publishing his book, *Classification and
    Uses of Fingerprints*, in 1900\. The following year, Henry's classification was
    introduced to the London Metropolitan Police; later that year, it was fully functional
    at the Fingerprint Office at New Scotland Yard, with the first court conviction
    by fingerprint evidence being obtained in 1902.

    in a number of jurisdictions, with concerns over the lack of valid standards for
    evaluating whether two prints match. No uniform process exists for determining
    a sound basis for confirming identification based on fingerprint examinations.
    Some examiners rely on counting the number of similar ridge characteristics on
    the prints, but there is no fixed requirement about the number of points of similarity,
    and this varies significantly in different jurisdictions. Some courts in the USA
    have gone as far as to state that fingerprint identification is not based on sound
    forensic science principles. Similar criticism about the lack of standardization
    and scientific research has been directed at digital forensics, a far newer discipline.

    for many decades and required a small number of staff to input data for processing
    and then receive the output in hardcopy form. They were regarded as secure information
    repositories as so few had the expertise and understanding to use the devices.
    Security was simply not a problem, and computer printouts were readily accepted
    by courts without issue. However, the advent of cheaper and easier-to-use desktop
    machines, combined with network systems, changed the security landscape of computing.

    be traced back to as early as 1984, when the FBI laboratory and other law enforcement
    agencies began developing programs to examine computer evidence. Andrew Rosen
    wrote the first purpose-built digital forensic tool, Desktop Mountie, for the
    Canadian police, which he followed up with versions of Expert Witness, Encase,
    and SMART. The rapid and almost worldwide acquisition of relatively cheap and
    easy-to-use desktop computers for personal and work use quickly attracted the
    attention of transgressors keen to exploit the new technology.

    and governments began to develop and implement computer security policies and
    countermeasures. Digital forensics emerged in response to victims of cyberattacks
    and exploitation realizing that some structure was needed to deal with an escalating
    problem. Eventually, some established forensic processes emerged in the late eighties,
    but much of the research and development of digital forensic tools and software
    was vendor-driven or produced by enthusiastic law enforcement officers with some
    basic computer knowledge.

    entirely a civil matter as it involves disputes between different organizations,

    and it can be applied to digital forensics with some refinements as the only way
    to handle large data volumes. [Chapter 5](ch05.html "Chapter 5. The Need for Enhanced

    evidence analysis process. Careful planning of the examination is not always supported
    by existing processes and certainly not for practitioners faced with unfamiliar
    case types or unusually complex, large-scale cases. In such circumstances, practitioners
    need to be provided with the correct balance of case background information to
    assist them with filtering voluminous case information, which may otherwise prove
    overwhelming.

    evidence of a crime and clearly define the scope and goals in the absence of tools,
    standards, or structured support processes. Regrettably, current forensics tools
    often fail to provide adequate investigatory support to practitioners and may
    be described as first generation without incorporating any decision support to

    compared to proven investigative processes existing in more traditional forensic
    disciplines. The rapid pace of technological advancement together with the changeability

    required to collect large volumes of data unprecedentedly in support of investigations,
    were further hampered by non-standardized analytical procedures and protocols
    lacking standard terminology. It was apparent then, and remains so to this day,
    that there was a need for forensic tools to be more carefully crafted to analysis
    processes. This would then meet the needs of the practitioner by providing more
    friendly user interfaces to address the problem of training and enhancing practitioner
    experience.

    and this is very true in cases where digital evidence is being tendered. US courts
    are especially sensitive to expert testimony relating to digital evidence, and
    the much-publicized legal case in 1993 between Daubert and Merell Dow Pharmaceuticals
    set a precedent for forensic practitioners and the processes and tools they used
    to recover evidence. The ruling has set a standard of expectation by US courts
    based on case law where the initial ruling held sway. The Daubert Standard, which
    replaced earlier case law, requires practitioners to establish their personal
    expert qualifications and necessitates them validating the reliability and accuracy
    of the forensic processes and tools they use in recovering evidence.

    to measure whether digital evidence meets specific criteria to address the need,
    applicability, and admissibility of digital forensics practitioners in a given
    situation, such as the one in the United States based on the Frye test, now replaced

    provide expert testimony to verify whether, for example, network systems provide
    and have maintained a sound protection of the stored data. Vendor hype used to
    secure the sale of a network system is not always reflected in them providing
    reassurance as to the accuracy and completeness of the data stores. Vendors often
    do not provide sufficient information about the software and networks' ability
    to protect the integrity of data. Consequently, practitioners are unable to validate
    the devices to the extent that they could survive legal challenge.

    to ensure that no parts of the examination process were overlooked or were repetitive,

    determine its validity, which may require new lines of investigation and further
    verification of other evidence as circumstances dictate. It is often a tedious
    process, and frequently, an inordinate amount of time and resources is required
    to collect and analyze digital evidence. The sheer volume of the cases and the
    time required for investigation can negate the efficacy of practitioners to reconstruct
    and provide an accurate interpretation of the evidence.

    in the digital forensic process should pass the acceptable "reasonableness test",
    meaning that all possible effort shouldn't be put into finding all conceivable
    trace evidence and then seizing and analyzing it. This is especially becoming
    more challenging to practitioners as the volume of data to be analyzed becomes
    enormous and crosses over many networks. In my casework, it is evident that in
    practice, a gap exists between what is theoretically possible and what is necessary
    to complete an examination. While in theory there may be a desire to complete
    analysis of every byte of data, there is rarely any justification in doing so.

    the development of digital forensics, and defined its purpose in light of more
    established forensic disciplines. An outline was presented of its value in public
    and private investigations and the rise and nature of cybercrime. The role of
    digital forensic practitioners, the skills and experience required, and the challenges
    they face were provided along with some case studies of digital forensic crime
    scenes to highlight the topic. The chapter provided not only a brief insight into
    the challenges the discipline faces but also some solutions to better manage them
    through enhanced forensic processes and tools that are emerging. Finally, the
    chapter endeavored to share some basic ideas for those of you considering becoming
    a practitioner, which you will hopefully find insightful and constructive.
