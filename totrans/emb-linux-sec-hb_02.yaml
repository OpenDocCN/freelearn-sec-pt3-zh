    Here in the design phase, I’d say that’s radically insufficient. I say it’s *Measure
    twice, change rulers, compare the new ruler to the old one, measure two more times
    with the new ruler, and then consider the cut carefully*. If still in doubt, you
    should get a third ruler (and start again!). I would also recommend a peer review
    before the initial cut. A peer review is something I cannot recommend highly enough.

    pitching the proposal to management, it’s absolutely a necessity to spend some
    time where you need to roll up your sleeves and set some clear design goals for
    the product.
  prefs: []

- en: Let’s walk through this together. You need to ask yourself some questions and
    be able to answer them in vast detail. The age of building a technological solution
    and throwing it on the market just because it’s shiny is long over. Your prospective
    customers have tight budgets and massive time constraints. Adding value to the
    customer must be the single greatest attribute of any proposed solution.

    This answer must be a clear and exacting response to this question, *What business
    need or problem is your appliance solution designed to address in order to add
    value to the end-customers?* To answer this question, one must know a few key
    points. What exactly is the problem? What are the workarounds (if any)?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    in several boxes. Next, ask yourself, *How complex this solution is to implement
    and does the average customer have the in-house ability to design/implement a
    home-grown solution themselves?* The answer must be *My solution adds value to
    people’s lives or provides a valuable service that otherwise may be hard* *to
    obtain.*

    knowledge of your targeted buyers’ and users’ requirements. This insight will
    greatly aid in determining which features you must plan for to achieve the technological
    win and eventually the sale of your embedded Linux systems appliances. Both have
    vastly different drivers and motivators that explicitly impact what they demand
    from a solution. Preemptively getting access directly or indirectly to these people
    within your target industry in order to gather intelligence will be a strategic
    activity for your teams. Focus groups and surveys can also be an invaluable tool
    in the requirements information collection effort as well. Use every tool and
    method at your disposal. Business can be like war, so don’t play fairly. Take
    every advantage.

    indulge me a moment for one more warning. Failure to address the needs and wants
    of your target audiences will ultimately result in poor adoption rates for the
    solution. I’d be remiss if I didn’t add in the fact that politics within your
    customers’ organizations can be a hidden factor as well. Gather as much intelligence
    as you can before you speak to these personas. Preparation and having answers
    to questions they will or may ask is crucial. The political and hidden motives
    of the customer, although not directly involved with security, can easily shift
    to a security feature discussion or bashing session where your competition is
    thrown on center stage with you (metaphorically, of course).

    anyone who will be actually involved in the deployment, testing, or usage of your
    product. These customer personas might be a department head, an executive, someone
    in the finance department, or a procurement specialist. So, let’s dive into the
    differences in driving factors for some of these examples.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    mean the difference between success, a reduced adoption rate, or, even worse,
    a failed deployment altogether. The weight they carry in their respective organizations
    often can move obstacles for your team, but remember this – if you fail to plan
    for their requirements in your solution, the very mountains they move might be
    ones moved against your initiative.
  prefs: []

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A department head can become your easiest ally or your hardest obstacle, as
    their realm of control and experience is deeply in tune with the needs of their
    organization. They may have already had experience (or general knowledge) of your
    solution or a competitor’s solution in the past when they were in a different
    role. Their security requirements can be both strategic and tactical based on
    their unique domain knowledge.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The department head may also be in favor of a home-grown solution, or your solution
    may be in the running to replace one they had previously created (which is why
    they got promoted to department head in the first place).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Commonly, a department head persona will also most likely lean on one or more
    of their staff for their input and consideration. That level of collaboration
    makes them the most *in the know* of the target buyers. Because of this, they
    often come to the table with their lists of *must-have* security features along
    with secondary lists of *nice-to-haves*.

    wholly upon that notion. These people are the bane of any sales team’s existence.
    They truly do not care about the value of a solution or the enablement it provides.
    Oftentimes, these individuals come from a legal or financial background, which
    makes sense as their purpose is to negotiate purchasing contracts.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In seeking out solutions on behalf of their company, they are often given a
    shopping list of features, but often, they are not educated exactly on what the
    solutions do nor how they work. This persona might require additional enablement
    to understand why your solution is the best. If you can get to them during your
    design phase, they can help drive the required features and help the product team
    set an initial price point for your solution. In my experience and my humble opinion,
    these folks are the toughest customers to deal with in any sales/presales cycle.

    hopefully, using your solution on a regular basis. They are the most informed
    on what features make their lives easier. They will have the greatest level of
    opinion on your interface and the operation of the appliance. They may already
    have an older version of your solution or, even worse, a competitor’s solution
    already in place. This group can make or break a deal. As they are the ultimate
    consumers of the solution, their influence is key in the procurement of products
    and services for their organizations.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    that you are building into the solution. Your solution’s very purpose is to make
    their jobs easier and to grant them additional capabilities that they may not
    have on their own. Appliance solutions’ sole purpose is to provide advanced functionality
    to those who do not have technical abilities or advanced levels of support within
    the organization for that function.

    give a massive advantage in the elimination of certain guesswork regarding specific
    security features being required, which security features are a *nice-to-have*,
    and, finally, which security features may be considered optional initially. Take
    this all with a pinch of salt as the landscape changes, personnel change, and
    this list of design requirements you are creating is also subject to change.

    my years of experience are more directly focused on the North American marketplace.
    It can also be argued that the largest marketplace for embedded systems is North
    America itself; this fact alone creates the opportunity for manufacturers worldwide
    to create solutions to sell there.

    secure your hardware supply chain, you induce massive amounts of risk in the future
    in supporting your product once it’s been adopted by end-customers. What does
    this actually translate into? It becomes an issue if you can no longer support
    the existing hardware initially deployed and may create a complex situation where
    your product has multiple platforms that become a support nightmare and a logistics
    nightmare. Or, even worse, by changing platforms, you introduce an unknown vulnerability
    or software incompatibility. And let’s be honest, we’re here because we want to

    ending their downstream support of the operating system, hence transitioning CentOS
    to a development release set in between Fedora and **Red Hat Enterprise Linux**
    (**RHEL**) rather than a downstream free-to-use somewhat similar operating system
    to RHEL. Rocky is named in honor of one of the original founders of CentOS who
    has sadly passed away.

    that is a good question to ask. It’s even more important to have multiple plans
    to mitigate it. This is vastly more critical if you are manufacturing a hardware-based
    appliance solution.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is common, if not critical, to align your planned life cycle with your hardware
    vendors. What if your solution requires additional third-party components? What
    other sources do you have for spare parts? Is there a plan to maintain some parts
    on hand at repair facilities? And let’s not forget to ensure that support staff
    have every possible combination of platform hardware and third-party components
    in their lab in order to troubleshoot customer issues and provide quality support.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another instance where this adds a level of intricacy is when changes in hardware
    components induce changes in required drivers, kernel modules, libraries, and
    so on. This means each combination must be fully vetted, scanned, and validated
    to the same level of security measures. Keeping the number of combinations to
    a minimum will ultimately assist your teams in being able to deliver at scale.
    Otherwise, it becomes death by a thousand cuts; every customer has a slight variation
    from the next, or even worse, not every system for an individual customer is even
    the same. There you have it. A security *AND* support nightmare on your hands.
    With each new release or patching schedule, every combination must be accounted
    for. This can also impact how you provide updates to your customers and further
    impact the customer experience.

    your design and product planning strategies. I highly recommend creating a detailed
    checklist based on what your needs and desires are for your product’s future.
    Ensuring the stability, supportability, and longevity of your solution will make
    it easier to design, create, and sell a better, more secure appliance. Ultimately,
    you’ll just be giving the end-customer more of what they expect from your solution.
