- en: Digital forensics is an expansive term that can cover a multitude of subject
    areas. Broadly speaking, it refers to the investigation of crimes committed on,
    or with the use of, a computing device. Several years ago, this may have only
    been applicable to cases in which an investigator was looking at financial fraud,
    intellectual property theft, or similar cases where computers are, by definition,
    necessary in order to commit the crime.

    even a crime that seems to be unrelated to computing—a house burglary where jewellery
    is stolen, for example, or the abduction of a child walking home from school—can
    involve a whole host of digital evidence.

    different from earlier versions both forensically and from a user experience point

    the most salient points in investigation and to discuss the broad implications

    behind the filesystems creation was that it would be easily scalable, as well
    as being secure and reliable at all levels. This does present some unique challenges
    for forensic investigation and administrative usage, however knowing that any
    file can be located anywhere on the system makes it challenging to understand
    precisely what one is looking at when analyzing a machine.

    by almost any case is the sheer amount of data and number of sources available
    to be worked through. A useful skill to have is the ability to look through the
    sources of evidence involved with a case and make a value judgement as to which

    across many different types of investigations. While some will vary from case
    to case—looking for evidence of intellectual property theft or financial fraud
    will differ hugely from the sources you'd be locating in a child protection investigation,
    for instance on the whole, the following sources of evidence can generally provide
    useful information from which you can then extrapolate further.

    programs to deal with, and therefore fewer sources of potential evidence, but
    there was also less room for confusion. XP was when Windows began to support the
    NT filesystem, which gave a boost to the previous FAT setup and allowed for more
    in—depth analysis of the system.

    sources of evidence, which is still the case today. The aim from a user experience
    perspective was essentially to speed things up. Prefetch files take note of which
    programs are used most frequently and make sure that those programs are pre-loaded
    into the memory, so that when a user boots up a machine and then tries to access
    one of the programs, it will load more quickly. From a forensic point of view,
    this means that prefetch files provide a wealth of information regarding a user's
    general computer habits—which programs they use most often, and to some extent,
    how they are being used. Prefetch files are stored in the `%SystemRoot%Prefetch`
    directory and will be discussed in more depth in [Chapter 7](68f38c3f-3c60-45d9-a745-72cb085bb9d7.xhtml),

    devices, called **BitLocker To Go**. Provided that the password is known, decryption
    of BitLocker information is relatively straightforward and can be performed using
    a range of forensic software, some of which will be detailed later in this book.
    The simplest way to ascertain whether a volume has been encrypted using BitLocker
    is to look for `-FVE-FS-` in the volume header. Once this has been determined
    and the password has been found or recovered, tools such as FTK or EnCase can
    be used to decrypt the information.

    the way in which user accounts are structured within Windows also changed. This
    is mainly noticeable from the perspective of the user themselves, in that the
    main change is that many system-wide modifications that could previously be made
    by any user can now only be made by an administrator. This can also be an important
    point forensically, particularly in cases where a computer has multiple users,

    to demonstrate will probably depend, at least in part, on the nature of the case
    on which you are working. Civil cases, for example, will generally not require
    such a high level of evidential integrity as criminal investigations, since civil
    cases are less likely to end up in court. It is good practice, however, to get
    used to maintaining as high a level of forensic soundness as possible;"doing so
    means that, if in the future you specialize in more in-depth investigations, you
    will already you will already be used to setting the right level of groundwork

    to create an exact copy of the data contained therein—and then to use this forensic
    image as the basis for your analysis, rather than conducting analysis on the physical
    device you have seized from the scene. Sometimes, you may also be required to
    verify both that the copy is authentic, and that the process you used to copy
    the data did not alter it in any way. Audit trails are a large part of this—if
    you can demonstrate where the data sources have been stored, in which devices,
    for how long, and who has had access to them, this should suffice.

    is the first step in this process and must be done with care. Switching off or
    unplugging a machine, typing in a password, moving a mouse, or performing any
    other kind of interaction with an object encountered in the course of a crime
    scene investigation can have unpredictable effects on the outcome of the investigation.
    Sometimes, devices are set up to be wiped automatically when turned off; some

    in the state in which it is found. For example, if a mobile phone is recovered

    and therefore prevent signals from coming through while the phone is being transported.

    with it—for example, if a desktop PC is plugged in and turned on, but needs to
    be taken away for analysis—the person tasked with the removal of the item should

    absolutely necessary, and that any actions that take place are detailed within

    happens. However, this is a broad overview of the basic general requirements for
    the sound preservation of evidence, and these will differ—sometimes quite widely—depending
    on local or national legislation. One of the most challenging things about being
    a specialist in computer forensics is that computer crimes often have an international
    flavor, and it is not unheard of for an investigation to span several continents,
    let alone states within a given country.

    different way. End users are increasingly looking for more lightweight, quick
    to run devices that make their work and personal lives easier, which means that,
    in turn, technology companies such as Microsoft are turning to collaborations
    with other entities and making the personal computer less of a single, standalone
    piece of equipment and more of a portal to data stored elsewhere. It is quite
