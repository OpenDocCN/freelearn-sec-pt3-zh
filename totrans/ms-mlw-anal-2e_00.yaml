- en: New and developing technologies inevitably bring new types of malware with them,
    creating a huge demand for IT professionals who can keep that malware at bay.
    With the help of this updated edition of *Mastering Malware Analysis*, you’ll
    add valuable reverse engineering skills to your CV and learn how to protect organizations
    in the most efficient way.

- en: This book will familiarize you with multiple universal patterns behind different
    malicious software types and teach you how to analyze them using a variety of
    approaches. You’ll learn how to examine malware code and determine the damage
    it can cause to systems to ensure that the right prevention or remediation steps
    are followed. As you cover all aspects of malware analysis for Windows, Linux,
    macOS, and mobile platforms in detail, you’ll also get to grips with obfuscation,
    anti-debugging, and other advanced anti-reverse engineering techniques.

    perform the static analysis of samples for various platforms, including the basics
    of architecture and assembly. While you may already have some prior knowledge
    of the x86 family, less common architectures, such as PowerPC or SH-4, are also
    extensively targeted by malware nowadays, so they shouldn’t be underestimated.
