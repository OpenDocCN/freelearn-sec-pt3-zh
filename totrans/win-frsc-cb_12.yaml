    additional third-party software (usually it''s included in the package by the
    developers); you could fail to process the data source properly because it''s

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the most frequent criticisms levelled at digital forensic investigators
    comes in the form of a challenge to the soundness of the evidence they are presenting.
    This includes the common *It wasn't me* defense, wherein a defendant insists that
    they were not the one using the device in question; the suggestion that the evidence
    itself is somehow faulty; either because of a virus or malware having infected
    a device before it was analysed, or because the process of analysis itself has
    modified the data in some way.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are a couple of ways to deal with these concerns, so lets take a look
    at them one by one.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It wasn't me
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the most difficult challenges to deal with in digital forensic investigations
    is the defense that someone else must have been using a device when a crime or
    other nefarious activity occurred. It is a favorite among defendants around the
    world.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'It is almost always impossible to definitively prove that a specific individual
    was the one using a particular device at a given time. However, in most courts
    of law and certainly in civil cases, all the investigator is required to do is
    demonstrate that this is the case beyond reasonable doubt. Sure, someone else
    could have broken into the defendants house, guessed their password, and downloaded
    some indecent images of children onto their machine when they were out shopping
    for their elderly mother, but the likelihood of this is rather remote. This is
    an extreme example, but it does illustrate the point: most of the time, the user
    who actually owns the device is the person using it.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In cases where this is a little more difficult to prove—for example, when evidence
    is admitted from a machine which is shared by several people who live in the same
    household—there are sometimes other ways to prove beyond reasonable doubt that
    a particular person was the one accessing the device at that time.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Some useful questions to consider in such a case include:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Did the users behavior model that of a specific person within the household
    during the time the activity in question was taking place? For example, which
    tabs had recently been opened online? Were they checking a particular email account
    or social profile?
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If looking at a text-based document, does the language used correspond to the
    normal speech and writing patterns of the individual in question? Are they using
    words they commonly use in their other documents? Are some of the same words misspelled
    when you compare the document with messages you know they have sent?
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Can data from other devices help to establish the presence or absence of other
    household members at the time the activity took place?
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So for example, lets say that one member of a household is accused of downloading
    illegal files from the internet. Person A is your most likely suspect, because
    it is their account that was logged in when the downloads occurred.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, you might not have caught the person red-handed, so you will need to
    look for other data sources in order to demonstrate beyond any reasonable doubt
    that it was them. Lets say the desktop computer in question is used by several
    members of the household, and each has their own account. Showing which account
    logged in would be the first step toward proving who downloaded the files.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At this point, the defendant may say that someone else must have used their
    account; perhaps they accidentally left it logged in, or perhaps someone guessed
    or knew the password.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Guessing the password is always a possibility, but another persons writing style
    is much harder to fake, so this is where you can bring in the other questions
    that were listed above. Firstly, look at the language used by the person who downloaded
    the files. Did they run any related searches before the downloads occurred, and
    if so, do the search terms contain any linguistic markers that may prove useful?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Generally, by this point, you will have demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt
    that your defendant is guilty. But, for the sake of argument, lets say your defendant
    is very insistent that they were not using the computer. No matter how much evidence
    you present to them, they never admit to a word you say, and continue to say *It
    wasn't me*.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You may now want to look at evidence gathered from the other people in the household,
    to see whether data from their devices can establish that none of them downloaded
    the files.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Luckily, the booming internet of things industry is making such data increasingly
    easy to collect. Lets say you have managed to seize every device in the house,
    and you have the datasets in front of you. You look through them in the Timeline
    views we discussed in [Chapter 11](1553dc63-2b62-49f7-ae18-7db64dd6bc0d.xhtml),
    *Data Visualization,* and you narrow down your investigation to the time when
    the files were being downloaded.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now you can discover what each household member was doing at a given time. Lets
    say that person B in the house does all the cooking, and at the time the messages
    were sent, the **Amazon Echo** was on the counter in the kitchen, talking through
    a recipe for beef bourguignon. Data from the smart TV shows that someone was sitting
    on the sofa watching a movie, and this is backed up by data from person C's smartphone,
    which was being used idly to Google names of the actors who were appearing on
    the screen.

    cascading avalanche of desperation. Lets stick with our example above. Having
    established that it must have been person A at the computer when the files were

    although they were using the device, they didn''t deliberately download the files.
    So either the machine must have a virus, or they might have been hacked.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    Alongside the usual challenges with trying to prove a negative, investigators
    also come up against increasingly intelligent malware which can cover its tracks,
    overwrite logs, and delete itself from systems with barely a trace.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In most cases, however, you can use a few methods to establish the likelihood
    that a virus is present on a machine.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Firstly, and most importantly, run a scan. Unless you are working a particularly
    complex case, most malware will show up in an initial scan, and once you know
    what it is, you will be able to work out what it can and cannot do. Also, check
    whether the machine has antivirus software, and if so, whether it is up to date.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Secondly, if your investigation is focused on a specific time frame, as in our
    current example, look at what else was happening on the machine at that time.
    If someone was sending messages in one tab while illegal files were being downloaded
    in another, it is highly unlikely that they did not know about it. Likewise, it
    is unlikely that a virus would have navigated to a website, downloaded P2P software,
    given the computer permission to install said software, clicked through all the
    options, agreed to the terms and conditions, opened the software, and then used
    it to download images.
  prefs: []

- en: Your process is faulty
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A much more serious defense is when a person claims that the investigator's
    process was faulty. They may claim, for example, that the evidence was contaminated;
    that their case was unfairly handled; that their rights were not upheld; or that
    crucial data was skipped, among other things.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The most efficient way to troubleshoot against such things happening is to take
    precautions to make sure you do not come up against them in the first place. Arguably,
    the most important of these is establishing and maintaining a proper chain of
    custody.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A chain of custody is essentially the paperwork that shows where the evidence
    you have collected has been, how long it has been there, and who was responsible
    for it. So if you are working in a team of investigators, your chain of custody
    documentation should detail who attended the scene, who viewed the devices at
    the scene and decided whether to remove them or not, how were they handled when
    they were removed (for example, were they shut down and unplugged, or were they
    already switched off when they were found), how they got to the processing area,
    who was responsible for them during that time, and who was ultimately responsible
    for analyzing the data.

    are legal and jurisdictional constraints.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    of which is in a country which has no reciprocal agreement with your own. Perhaps
    data is stored on the cloud and its legal jurisdiction is unclear. Perhaps you
    have compiled a case against a suspect, but they are in another jurisdiction and
    you have no authority there.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Ultimately, we all have to work within the boundaries of the law. While popular
    culture may show digital forensic experts illegally hacking into suspects' computers
    and breaking all sorts of rules to make sure their case reaches a conviction,
    in the real world this is not a possibility.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you do come up against a jurisdictional challenge, your best bet is to follow
    through with the relevant authorities as best you can. In cases involving serious
    crimes, for example child protection or drug trafficking investigations, there
    will often be a way to work with international law enforcement agencies to ensure
    that your case can be solved. This can take time and requires a lot of patience,
    however the end result is usually worth it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The main thing to bear in mind when it comes to legal challenges is that, tempting
    as it may be to cut a few corners when you know someone is committing a crime,
    this will only damage your investigation. Not only will your own reputation be
    put on the line, but your potential contamination of evidence may lead to a case
    being thrown out, thus having the opposite effect to the one you intended.
