    devices running Android operating systems. These tools include all the best mobile
    forensics tools, such as UFED Physical Analyzer (Cellebrite), Oxygen Forensics
    (Oxygen Forensics, Inc), .XRY (MSAB), MOBILedit Forensic Express (COMPELSON Labs),
    and Secure View (Susteen).

    for extracting and analyzing mobile devices in their products. These tools are:
    Encase Forensic (OpenText Corp.), MPE+ (AccessData), Belkasoft Evidence Center

    dumps and backups can be analyzed via a free tool – Autopsy, or via a cheap tool
    that has good functionality - Andriller.

    They can be viewed. You can generate the report for all detected thumbnails or
    only for thumbnails tagged by an expert. Also, if the thumbnails have headers,
    and similar headers of  the graphics file in JPG format, the program can extract
    metadata, which will also be presented in the report, from the headers.
