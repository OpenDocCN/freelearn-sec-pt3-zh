    devices running Android operating systems. These tools include all the best mobile
    forensics tools, such as UFED Physical Analyzer (Cellebrite), Oxygen Forensics
    (Oxygen Forensics, Inc), .XRY (MSAB), MOBILedit Forensic Express (COMPELSON Labs),
    and Secure View (Susteen).

    functionality in the examination of mobile devices. This is due to the fact that
    every year the number of mobile devices that come for examination to forensic
    laboratories increases. It means that experts need software for their analysis.
    Encase Forensic is following this trend. If we take a look at User Manual Encase
    Forensic, we can see that one third of this document is dedicated to the mobile
    devices' data extraction and analysis, their physical dumps, and backups. Encase
    Forensic can extract data from Android mobile devices and analyze their backups
    and physical dumps.

- en: Any expert understands the importance of analyzing the thumbnail databases of
    graphics files and video files on the device. As well as on computers, similar
    bases can be found on Android mobile devices. The complexity of their examination
    is that its bases have different names and are saved on different paths (depending
    on the Android version). Even before the option of such bases analysis appeared
    in mobile forensics tools, in our forensic laboratory, ThumbnailExpert was used
    for detection and analysis of such databases.

    graphics files created by various computer programs, but in addition to the extraction
    and analysis of thumbnail databases of the programs that are known to the tool,
    you can also search for new thumbnail databases. In order to search for such bases
    on an Android mobile device, you should copy the partition "user" filesystem from
    your mobile device to your computer or, for example, to a flash drive. This procedure
    must be done before the analysis.'

    and similar headers of  the graphics file in JPG format, the program can extract
    metadata, which will also be presented in the report, from the headers.
