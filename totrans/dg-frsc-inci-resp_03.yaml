    to legal matters. In an incident, **CSIRT** (short for **computer security incident
    response team**) members may be called upon to perform analysis on digital evidence
    acquired during the incident, utilizing digital forensics tools, techniques, and
    knowledge. To make certain that the evidence is processed correctly and can subsequently
    be admitted in a courtroom, digital forensics examiners need to understand the
    legal issues, along with the fine points, of the digital forensics process.

    digital forensics examiners, as well as the rules that govern how evidence is
    admitted in court. To provide context to the kinds of actions taken, we will also
    explore the digital forensics process and, finally, address the infrastructure
    necessary to incorporate a digital forensics capability into a CSIRT.

- en: In the last 20 years, we have seen an explosion in the interest in forensic
    science. Simply put, forensics is the application of science to legal matters.
    The actual practice of forensics is to take physical and digital evidence through
    a process of analysis and present scientific findings in a court of law. Despite
    its depiction within popular media, forensic science is a detailed and exacting
    process, which requires well-thought-out processes and procedures, technology,
    and experience.

    the purview of criminal justice. Air crash investigators use forensic techniques
    to investigate aircraft failures, for example. Accounts use very similar principles
    and techniques when conducting investigations into suspected fraud and money laundering
    schemes. Even the art world, known for historic fakes, employs forensic techniques
    to verify the authenticity of works of art.

    Ripper murders in the late 1800s. Investigators in the London Metropolitan Police
    were able to identify, collect, and later examine physical evidence left by the
    unknown perpetrator. Around that time, two other tried and true forensic practices,
    fingerprint comparison and crime scene photography, were added to the growing
    body of knowledge and practices.

    until after World War II. This seventy-five-year period would see the inclusion
    of DNA evidence as a powerful way to identify perpetrators. Technology was applied
    to tool marks and ballistics. It was also in the latter half of the twentieth
    century that digital forensics found its way into the various forensic science
    disciplines.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A key principle that guides forensics is **Locard’s exchange principle**. Dr.
    Edmond Locard was a pioneer in the fields of forensics and criminalistics. His
    contributions to these fields led to many deeming him the Sherlock Holmes of France.
    His principle, simply put, is that every moment of contact with the physical world
    leaves a trace. For example, a burglar breaks a window to enter a home. They then
    crawl through this window and begin to grab the items around them. According to
    Locard’s exchange principle, the burglar will leave traces of dirt from their
    shoes on the carpet. Skin and hairs may fall away from their body onto the various
    surfaces of the home. Without gloves, the burglar might also leave fingerprints
    on the door handles.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This exchange is a two-way street. As our burglar leaves traces of themself
    around the house, traces of the house are left on them. Carpet fibers attach to
    their shoes. Fragments of the broken windows may also embed themselves into the
    burglar’s footwear and clothing. These pieces of trace evidence can tie the burglar
    to the scene.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This principle has been in force since the first criminal activity took place.
    What has changed is the ability of forensic scientists and criminalistic practitioners
    to detect and analyze this trace evidence. For example, DNA evidence has been
    around since Cain slew Abel. It is only recently that it has become useful in
    an investigation because methods and technologies have developed to the point
    that forensic scientists can definitively prove that biological material can be
    tied to a specific individual to the exclusion of every other human being.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are a few considerations to keep in mind about this principle. First,
    there is a good deal of variation in how long trace evidence can be found. For
    example, some trace evidence, such as tool marks that are left when a pry bar
    is used to force open a door, may persist for months or even years. On the other
    hand, fingerprints exposed to the elements are easily rendered unsuitable days
    or even hours after they were left. Second, certain processes that maintain the
    integrity of trace evidence need to be followed. If trace evidence is not collected
    properly, it can be altered or destroyed, making it completely unusable for investigative
    purposes. Third, there needs to be a corresponding technology that aids in the
    analysis of trace evidence. DNA has existed since the dawn of life on Earth. The
    ability to leverage this trace evidence for investigative purposes relies on the
    technology to properly compare and analyze DNA samples. Finally, the human element
    is also present. Trace evidence needs to be handled by trained and qualified analysts
    who can review the data and draw conclusions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It may seem a bit odd to be discussing Locard’s exchange principle within the
    field of digital forensics. The reality is that the same principle that underpins
    forensics in the physical world has the same applicability in digital forensics.
    For example, a simple connection to a system via the Microsoft Windows Remote
    Desktop feature leaves traces. In this case, an external threat actor has obtained
    valid user credentials and is able to connect through an exposed system. The connection
    itself would create a log entry on the exposed system. The use of valid credentials
    to log into the system would create a second log entry. Contained within this
    log entry is the IP address of the threat actor’s system. This IP address may
    also be contained within firewall logs. The threat actor would also have log entries
    and potentially files from the compromised system on their own system.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What is important to understand about Locard’s exchange principle is the concept
    of trace evidence. Threat actors will go to great lengths to remove their tracks
    the same way very good criminals will but there is still a trace. The key is having
    the tools and ability to discover these traces and tie them back to a threat actor.

    control, if the users have a reasonable expectation of privacy. This can lead
    to an organization being held liable for sniffing traffic on its own network if,
    in fact, its users have a reasonable expectation of privacy. For CSIRT members,
    this creates potential legal problems if they access network resources or other
    systems. This can be easily remedied by having all system users acknowledge that

    of incident response. It is often the application of digital forensics methods
    that allows incident responders to gain a clear understanding of the chain of
    events that led to a malicious action, such as a compromised server or other data
    breach. For other incidents, such as internal fraud or malicious insider activity,
    digital forensics may provide the proverbial smoking gun that points to the guilty
    party. Before a detailed examination of tools and techniques available to incident
    responders, it is critical to address the foundational elements of digital forensics.

    the use of computers by criminals began to gain more prominence, agencies such
    as the United States **Federal Bureau of Investigation** (**FBI**) decided to
    incorporate a dedicated digital and forensic investigation capability. This led
    to the creation of the FBI **Computer Analysis and Response Team** (**CART**).

    long enough to trace the connection. These efforts paid off and Stoll, along with
    other authorities, was able to trace the hacker and eventually prosecute him for

    digital forensics into their investigative capabilities, the need for the standardization
    of forensic processes became more apparent. In 1993, an international conference
    was held to specifically address the role of computer evidence. Shortly thereafter,
    in 1995, the **International Organization on Computer Evidence** (**IOCE**) was
    formed. This body was created to develop guidelines and standards around the various
    phases of the digital forensic examination process. In 1998, in conjunction with
    the IOCE, federal crime laboratory directors created the **Scientific Working
    Group on Digital Evidence** (**SWGDE**). This group represented the United States

    levels in a variety of cybercriminal investigations. The capability of the RCFL
    has grown over the last two decades, with 17 separate RCFLs spread across the
    United States. In addition, other federal, state, and local police agencies have

    the infected system. As some malware requires access to a C2 server, analysts
    can search firewall connections or proxy logs for any outbound traffic from the

    of host systems such as desktops, it may become necessary to isolate the system
    from the rest of the network, through either physical or logical controls, network
    access controls, or perimeter controls. It is also critical that no users are
    allowed to access a suspect system. This ensures that users do not deliberately
    or inadvertently taint the evidence. Another facet of preservation measures has

- en: Chain of custody describes the documentation of a piece of evidence through
    its life cycle. This life cycle begins when an individual first takes custody
    of the piece of evidence and ends when the incident is finally disposed of and
    the evidence can either be returned or destroyed. Maintaining a proper chain of
    custody is critical. In the event that a piece of evidence has to be brought into
    a courtroom, any break in the chain of custody can lead to the piece of evidence
    being excluded from ever being admitted into the proceedings. It is therefore
    critical to ensure that the entire life cycle of the piece of evidence is recorded.

    custody of a piece of evidence.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first is **electronically**. There are manufacturers that provide organizations
    such as forensic laboratories or law enforcement agencies with hardware and software
    that automates the chain of custody process for evidence. These systems utilize
    unique barcoded stickers for each piece of evidence. A scanner then creates an
    electronic trail as it reads these barcodes.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The second method for creating and maintaining a chain of custody is the **paper
    and pen** method. This method makes use of paper forms that contain the necessary
    information to start and maintain a chain of custody. While the paper and pen
    method can be a bit cumbersome and requires more due diligence to ensure that
    the form is safeguarded from destruction or manipulation, it is a much more cost-effective
    solution for smaller CSIRTs that may not have the resources necessary to implement
    an automated solution.

    infected a desktop system as part of a larger attack, the extraction of specific
    information from an acquired memory image would take part at this stage. In other
    cases, digital forensics examiners may need to extract **Secure Shell** (**SSH**)
    traffic from a network capture. The examination of digital evidence also continues
    the process of proper preservation, in that examiners maintain evidence with the
    utmost care during the examination. If the digital forensics examiner does not

    a compromised host has an open connection to an external IP address, they would
    then correlate that information with an analysis of a packet capture taken from
    the network. Using the IP address as a starting point, the analyst would be able
    to isolate that traffic. From here, the analyst may be able to determine that
    the compromised host is sending out a beacon to a C2 server. From here, using
    additional sources, the analyst may be able to determine which attack vector is

    It is during this testimony that the forensic examiner will be required to present
    the facts of the forensic examination, in much the same dispassionate manner as
    the report. The examiner will be required to present facts and conclusions without
    bias and may be limited as far as what the opinions they can testify are. How
    an examiner will be allowed to testify is often dependent on their training and

    It is imperative that forensic examiners have a location that is separate from
    normal business operations. The best approach to achieving this separation is
    to provide CSIRT members directly involved in the examination of digital evidence
    with a location that is completely separate from the rest of the organization.
    A digital forensics lab should have several key features to ensure that examiners
    have the necessary privacy, but also to ensure the integrity of the evidence while

    a chain of custody, only those with a justifiable need should be allowed access
    to the lab. This limitation is necessary to remove any chance that the evidence
    can be tampered with or destroyed. The lab should therefore remain locked at all
    times. Ideally, access should be granted via access cards or fobs, with a central
    management system granting access. This allows for a complete reconstruction of
    all personnel who access the laboratory within a specific time period.

    properly stored while not being examined. Lockers should be secured, either through
    an onboard lock or through the use of a combination lock. The keys to these lockers
    should be secured within the laboratory and access should only be given to examiners.
    If the organization has adequate resources, each specific incident should have
    its own locker, with all the evidence contained within a single locker. This reduces
    the chance of digital evidence becoming commingled.

    store several images at a time. Smaller USB drives are also useful to have on

    notes in pen may seem old-fashioned but they are the best way to reconstruct events
    as an incident continues to develop. Having several steno notebooks and pens as
    part of the kit ensures that CSIRT personnel do not have to hunt down these items
    when a critical event has just occurred. Jump kits should be inventoried at least
    monthly so that they are fully stocked and prepared for deployment. They should
    also be secured and accessible to CSIRT personnel only. Left in public view, these
    kits are often raided by other personnel in search of a screwdriver, network cable,
    or flashlight. For CSIRTs that support geographically dispersed organizations,
    with several kits at key locations, such as major office headquarters, data centers,
    or other off-site locations, it may be a good idea to have several of these jump
    kits prestaged for use. This avoids having to cart the kit through an airport.
    An example of some items to be stocked in a jump kit can be seen in the following
    photo.'

- en: Incident response spans a wide range of disciplines, from legal to scientific.
    CSIRT members responsible for conducting digital forensics examinations should
    be very familiar with the legal and technical aspects of digital forensics. In
    addition, they should be familiar with a wide variety of tools and equipment necessary
    to acquire, examine, and present data discovered during an examination. The proper
    application of forensic techniques is critical to provide insight into the chain
    of events that led to the deployment of the CSIRT to investigate an incident.
    In this chapter, we initially delved into the various legal aspects of digital
    forensics, such as the rules of evidence and laws pertaining to cybercrime. Next,
    we discussed the science of digital forensics, providing an understanding of how
    techniques should be applied to investigations. To enhance this knowledge, we
    looked at how these techniques fit into a framework of digital investigations.
    We then conducted an overview of the various tools available for digital forensics
    examiners.
