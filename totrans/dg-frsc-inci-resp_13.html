<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.1">An incident response team functions in the same way that a fire department does. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.2">Both teams take time to prepare themselves with training on their respective techniques, tools, and practices, and they can respond at a moment’s notice to a fire or an incident. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.3">During their response to a fire, the firefighters take notes and record their actions, ensuring that critical decisions are documented and that individual contributions are noted. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.4">Once the fire is out, they sift through the debris to determine the causes and origins of the fire. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.5">Once the proper documentation has been prepared, the fire department conducts an after-action review to critique their performance and find avenues for improvement. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.6">Other reports allow fire departments and safety experts to update building codes and improve the survivability of structures should a fire </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.1">break out.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.1">Incident response teams utilize much of the same workflow. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.2">During an incident, notes are taken and actions are recorded. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.3">Evidence is obtained from systems and maintained in a forensically sound manner. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.4">A root cause analysis is conducted utilizing the notes, observations, and evidence obtained during the incident. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.5">This root cause analysis is utilized by information technology personnel to patch up vulnerabilities and further harden systems. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.6">Finally, the team conducts its own after-action review where the series of events is laid out and critiqued so that the team may improve their processes, their tools, and their techniques as well as make any corrections to the incident </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.1">response plan.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.1">To maximize the benefits of the root cause analysis and after-action brief, incident responders will need to ensure that all their actions are recorded in a proper fashion. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.2">They will also be required to prepare several documents that senior leaders and decision-makers will use when considering the future state of the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.1">IT infrastructure.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.1">To better prepare responders to craft the necessary documentation, the following topics will </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.1">be addressed:</span></span></p>

<h1 id="_idParaDest-217"><a id="_idTextAnchor222"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.1">Documentation overview</span></h1>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.1">This will be an </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1107"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.1">overview of incident documentation. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.2">In this section, we will look at what data to capture, the different audiences, and how to properly source the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.1">report content.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.1">The documentation associated with an incident takes several forms. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.2">The length of any documentation is often dictated by the type of incident. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.3">Simple incidents that take very little time to investigate and have a limited impact may be documented informally in an existing ticketing system. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.4">However, in more complex incident investigations, such as a data breach that has led to the disclosure of confidential information (such as medical records or credit card information), you may require extensive written reports and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.1">supporting evidence.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-218"><a id="_idTextAnchor223"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.1">What to document</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.1">When</span><a id="_idIndexMarker1108"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.1"> looking at documenting an incident, it is not very difficult to ascertain what should be documented. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.2">Following the five </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.1">Ws</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.1">Who</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.1">, </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.1">What</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.1">, </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.1">Where</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.1">, </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.1">When</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.1">, and </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.1">Why</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.1">), and sometimes </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.1">How</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.1">, is an excellent foundation when considering what to document during an incident. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.2">Another good piece of wisdom when discussing documentation, especially when discussing the legal implications of security incidents, is the axiom that if you didn’t write it down, it didn’t happen. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.3">This statement is used to drive home the point that proper documentation is often comprised of as much detail as the incident response analyst can provide. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.4">Analysts may be involved in an incident that ends up in a civil proceeding. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.5">The wheels of justice often move slowly, and an analyst may be called to the witness stand after 18 months, during which 10 other incidents may have transpired. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.6">Having as much detail available in the incident reporting will allow analysts to be able to reconstruct the events in a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.1">proper manner.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.1">An excellent example of using these five Ws (and one H) structure in your documentation is when looking at a digital forensics task, such as imaging a hard drive. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.2">In </span><a href="B18571_08.xhtml#_idTextAnchor136"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.1">Chapter 8</span></em></span></a><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.1">, proper documentation was partially addressed when we looked at the practice of imaging the suspect drive. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.2">The following is a more detailed record of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.1">the event:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.1">Who</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.1">: This is the easiest detail to note. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.2">Simply, who was involved in the process? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.3">For example, the person involved was analyst </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.1">Jane Smith.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.1">When</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.1">: Record the date and time that the imaging began and when it ended. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.2">For example, the imaging process started at 21:08 UTC on June 16, 2022, and ended at 22:15 UTC on June 16, 2022. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.3">Time is critical, and you should ensure that a normalized time zone is utilized throughout the investigation and indicated in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.1">the report.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.1">Where</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.1">: This should be a detailed location, such as </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.1">an office.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.1">What</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.1">: The action that was performed; for example, acquiring memory or firewall logs or imaging </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.1">a drive.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.1">Why</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.1">: Having a justification for the action helps in understanding the reason why the action </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.1">was performed.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.1">How</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.1">: A description of how an action is performed should be included. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.2">Additionally, if an incident response team utilizes playbooks or standard operating procedures as part of their plan, this should be included. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.3">Any departure from the standard operating procedures should also be </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.1">similarly recorded.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.1">Putting all this</span><a id="_idIndexMarker1109"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.1"> information together, the following sample language can be entered into </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.1">the report:</span></span></p>
<p><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.1">On June 16, 2022, analyst Jane Smith arrived at office 217 of the Corporate Office Park located at 123 Maple St., Anytown, US, as part of the investigation. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.2">Upon arrival, Smith took control of the Dell laptop, asset tag #AccLT009, serial #7895693-862. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.3">An alert from the firewall IDS/OPS indicated that the laptop had communicated with a known Command and Control server. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.4">The laptop was to be imaged in an attempt to ascertain whether it had been infected with malware. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.5">At 21:08 UTC, Smith imaged the drive utilizing the live imaging technique in accordance with the Standard Operating Procedure IR-002. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.6">The process was completed at 22:15 UTC on June </span></em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.1">16, 2022.</span></em></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.1">This entry provides sufficient detail to reconstruct the events that transpired. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.2">Taken together with other documentation, such as photographs and chain of custody, the analyst has a </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1110"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.1">clear picture of the process and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.1">the outcome.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-219"><a id="_idTextAnchor224"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.1">Types of documentation</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.1">There is no one </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1111"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.1">standard that dictates how an incident is documented, but there are a few distinct categories. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.2">As previously stated, the depth of the documentation will often depend on the type, scale, and scope of an incident; however, in general, the following </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.1">categories apply:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.1">Trouble ticketing system</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.1">: Most enterprise organizations have an existing ticketing system utilized to track system outages and other problems that normally arise in today’s network infrastructure. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.2">These systems capture a good deal of data associated with an incident. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.3">An entry usually captures the start and stop date and time, the original reporting person, and the action performed, and also provides an area for notes. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.4">The one major drawback to ticketing systems is that they were originally designed to support the general operations of enterprise infrastructures. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.5">As a result, more complex incidents will require much more documentation than is possible in these systems. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.6">Due to this, they are often reserved for minor incidents, such as isolated malware infections or other such minor incidents that are disposed </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.1">of quickly.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.1">Security Orchestration and Automation (SOAR) platforms</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.1">: Some organizations have seen the need for a dedicated incident response platform and have come up with applications and other types of infrastructure that support incident response teams. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.2">These incident response orchestration platforms allow analysts to input data, attach evidence files, and collaborate with other team members as well as pull in outside resources, such as malware reverse engineering and threat </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.1">intelligence feeds.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.1">There are several of these platforms available both commercially and as freeware. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.2">The main advantage of these platforms is that they automate the capture of information, such as the date, time, and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.1">analyst’s actions.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.1">Another distinct advantage is that they can limit who is able to see the information to a select group. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.2">With ticketing systems, there is the possibility that someone without authorization will observe details that the organization may want to keep confidential. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.3">Having an orchestration system can provide a certain level of confidentiality. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.4">Another key advantage is the ability for team members to see what actions are taken and what information is obtained. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.5">This cuts down the </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1112"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.1">number of calls made and the possibility </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.1">of miscommunication.</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.1">Written reports</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.1">: Even with automated platforms in use, some incidents require extensive written reporting. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.2">In general, these written reports can be divided into three main types. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.3">Each of the following types will be expanded on later in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.1">this chapter:</span></span><ul><li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.90.1">Executive summary</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.1">: The executive summary is a one- to two-page report that is meant to outline the high-level bullet points of the incident for the senior management. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.2">A brief synopsis of the events, a root cause, if it can be determined, and remediation recommendations are often sufficient for </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.92.1">this list.</span></span></li><li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.1">Incident investigation report</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.1">: This is the detailed report that is seen by a variety of individuals within the organization. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.2">This report includes the details of the investigation, a detailed root cause analysis, and thorough recommendations on preventing the incident from </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.1">occurring again.</span></span></li><li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.96.1">Forensic report</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.1">: The most detailed report that is created is the technical report. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.2">This report is generated when a forensic examination is conducted against the log files, captured memory, or disk images. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.3">These reports can be very technical, as they are often reviewed by other forensic personnel. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.4">These reports can be lengthy as outputs from tools and portions of evidence, such as log files, are </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.1">often included.</span></span></li></ul></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.99.1">Understanding the various categories that comprise an incident report allows responders to properly organize their material. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.99.2">Even smaller incidents create documentation, meaning that responders can become overwhelmed. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.99.3">Coupled with the high number of data sources, the reporting process can become a chore. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.99.4">To make the process flow better, responders should be prepared to address the various categories at the onset of an</span><a id="_idIndexMarker1113"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.100.1"> incident and organize their </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.101.1">documentation accordingly.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-220"><a id="_idTextAnchor225"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.102.1">Sources</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.103.1">When preparing </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1114"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.104.1">reports, there are several sources of data that are included within the documentation, whether the incident is small, requiring only a single entry into a ticketing system, all the way to a complex data breach that requires extensive incident and forensic reporting. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.104.2">Some sources include </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.105.1">the following:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.106.1">Personal observations</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.107.1">: Users may have some information that is pertinent to the case. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.107.2">For example, they might have clicked on a file in an email that appeared to come from a legitimate address. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.107.3">Other times, analysts may observe behavior in a system and make a note </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.108.1">of it.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.109.1">Applications</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.110.1">: Some applications produce log files or other data that may be necessary to include in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.111.1">a report.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.112.1">Network/host devices</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.113.1">: A great deal of this book deals with acquiring and analyzing evidence from a host of systems in an enterprise environment. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.113.2">Many of these systems also allow outputting reports that can be included with the overall incident or </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.114.1">forensic reporting.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.115.1">Forensic tools</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.116.1">: Forensic tools often have automated reporting functions. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.116.2">This can be as simple as an overview of some of the actions, as was addressed in the previous chapters, or the actual outputs, such as file hashes, that can be included within a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.117.1">forensic report.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.118.1">Wherever the material comes from, a good rule to follow is to capture and include as much as possible in the report. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.118.2">It is better to have more information </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.119.1">than less.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-221"><a id="_idTextAnchor226"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.120.1">Audience</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.121.1">One final consideration</span><a id="_idIndexMarker1115"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.122.1"> to bear in mind when preparing your documentation is who will read an incident report versus a detailed forensic report. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.122.2">In general, the following are some of the personnel, both internal and external to an organization, that may</span><a id="_idIndexMarker1116"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.123.1"> read the reports associated with </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.124.1">an incident:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.125.1">Executives</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.126.1">: High-profile incidents may be brought to the attention of the CEO or CFO, especially if they involve the media. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.126.2">The executive summary may suffice, but do not be surprised if the senior leadership requires a more detailed report and briefing during and at the conclusion of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.127.1">an incident.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.128.1">Information technology personnel</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.129.1">: These individuals may be the most interested in what the incident response analysts have found. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.129.2">Most likely, they will review the root cause analysis and remediation recommendations </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.130.1">very seriously.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.131.1">Legal</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.132.1">: If a lawsuit or other legal action is anticipated, the legal department will examine the incident report to determine whether there are any gaps in security or the relevant procedures for clarification. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.132.2">Do not be surprised if revisions must </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.133.1">be made.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.134.1">Marketing</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.135.1">: Marketing may need to review either the executive summary or the incident report to craft a message to customers in the event of an external </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.136.1">data breach.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.137.1">Regulators</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.138.1">: In regulated industries, such as healthcare and financial institutions, regulators will often review an incident report to determine whether there is a potential liability on the part of the organization. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.138.2">Fines may be assessed based upon the number of confidential records that have been breached, or if it appears that the organization </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.139.1">was negligent.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.140.1">Cyber insurers</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.141.1">: Cyber insurance is a recent development, largely in response to the explosion in ransomware. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.141.2">Cyber insurance companies may want to examine any written reports by analysts or responders in conjunction with claims filed by </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.142.1">their customers.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.143.1">Law enforcement</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.144.1">: Some incidents require law enforcement to become involved. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.144.2">In other instances, law enforcement may want to capture any IOCs or other data points associated with the investigation as it may help with potential future incidents. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.144.3">In these cases, law enforcement agencies may require copies of incident and forensics reports </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.145.1">for review.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.146.1">Outside support</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.147.1">: There are instances where an outside forensics or incident response support firm becomes necessary. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.147.2">In these cases, the existing reports would go a long way in bringing these individuals up </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.148.1">to speed.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.149.1">Understanding the audience gives incident response analysts an idea of who will be reading their</span><a id="_idIndexMarker1117"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.150.1"> reports. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.150.2">Understand that the report needs to be clear and concise. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.150.3">In addition to this, technical details may require some clarification for those in the audience that do not have the requisite knowledge </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.151.1">or experience.</span></span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-222"><a id="_idTextAnchor227"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.152.1">Executive summary</span></h1>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.153.1">Executives need to</span><a id="_idIndexMarker1118"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.154.1"> know key details of an incident without all the technical or investigative material. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.154.2">This section will examine how to prepare an effective executive summary that captures the needed details and recommendations for executives and other </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.155.1">key stakeholders.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.156.1">As was previously discussed, the executive summary captures the macro-level view of the incident. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.156.2">This includes a summary of the events, a description of the root cause, and what recommendations are being made to remediate and prevent such an occurrence from happening again. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.156.3">In regulated industries, such as financial institutions or hospitals that have mandatory reporting requirements, it is good practice to state whether the notification was necessary, and, if it was necessary, how many confidential records were exposed. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.156.4">This allows senior management to understand the depth of the incident and ensu</span><a id="_idTextAnchor228"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.157.1">re that the appropriate legal and customer communication steps </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.158.1">are addressed.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.159.1">The name of this report can be a bit misleading. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.159.2">The assumption is that this report is only for C-suite executives. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.159.3">While that is one of the target audiences, there are others that will often ask to be read in on an executive summary. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.159.4">Legal and marketing may need to have at least a cursory overview of the pertinent facts so that communications to customers or third parties can be accurately crafted. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.159.5">Other such external regulators may need a summary of the incident before a complete incident and technical analysis report has </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.160.1">been crafted.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.161.1">Let’s expand on the previous discussion on what the executive summary should contain. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.161.2">There is no hard and fast rule when it comes to content, but the following is a good foundation for </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.162.1">the summary:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.163.1">Summary of the events</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.164.1">: This is a brief, maybe half-page summary of the key events that took place during the incident. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.164.2">It is not meant to be a complete hour-by-hour account, but rather the key events that took place such as the initial detection, when the incident was contained, when the threat was completely removed from the environment, and, finally, when operations were back up </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.165.1">and running.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.166.1">Graphic timeline</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.167.1">: A graphic timeline helps in placing the key events on the appropriate day and time. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.167.2">Keep this graphic to about 8-12 specific entries that capture the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.168.1">high-level events.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.169.1">Root cause overview</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.170.1">: The root cause of the incident will be captured in the incident investigation report, but a short summary is helpful to the executive level to</span><a id="_idIndexMarker1119"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.171.1"> understand the nature of the incident. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.171.2">This can be a short statement, a few sentences, or a paragraph. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.171.3">For example, the following is sufficient for a root </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.172.1">cause statement:</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.173.1">The incident investigation determined that a still unknown adversary exploited a vulnerable web server using a specially crafted exploit. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.173.2">From here, the adversary was able to pivot into the enterprise network due to a network misconfiguration and execute ransomware </span></em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.174.1">on systems.</span></em></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.175.1">High-level recommendations</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.176.1">: A table with strategic and tactical recommendations should be included with a tie to the incident </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.177.1">investigation report.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.178.1">Additional reporting</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.179.1">: A brief statement concerning any additional documentation that will be prepared. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.179.2">For example, the author may want to include a statement indicating that the incident and associated forensics reports are being prepared and should be available within two weeks. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.179.3">This lets the readers know that if they need additional context or details, that </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.180.1">is forthcoming.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.181.1">From a workflow perspective, the executive summary can often be crafted as the first written documentation concerning the incident. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.181.2">For example, a major incident that takes two weeks to analyze and remediate will produce extensive documentation. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.181.3">An executive summary can be leveraged as a stop-gap measure for the time it takes to prepare the full report. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.181.4">This allows the leadership and other stakeholders to craft messaging, make immediate changes to the environment, and make other decisions without having </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.182.1">to wait.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.183.1">There are a few guidelines to follow when preparing an executive summary. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.183.2">First, keep the language at a high level of simplicity. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.183.3">Specific technical terms may confuse some readers so keep the language as non-technical as possible. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.183.4">Second, keep it short with an opening to follow on documentation. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.183.5">Third, keep the discussion high level with a focus on a macro </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1120"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.184.1">level impact on the organization. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.184.2">Two pages are usually the maximum. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.184.3">In certain circumstances, it may be beneficial to use a PowerPoint presentation in place of a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.185.1">written summary.</span></span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-223"><a id="_idTextAnchor229"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.186.1">Incident investigation report</span></h1>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.187.1">A comprehensive </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1121"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.188.1">incident investigation involves a wide variety of actions performed by various personnel. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.188.2">These actions are captured in the narrative report that details the sequence of the investigation along with providing a timeline </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.189.1">of events.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.190.1">The incident report has perhaps the widest audience within, and external to, the organization. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.190.2">Even though there are individuals with limited technical skills who will be reviewing this report, it is important to have the proper terminology and associated data. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.190.3">There will always be time to explain technical details to those that may </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.191.1">be confused.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.192.1">The following are some of the key pieces of data that should be captured and incorporated into </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.193.1">the report:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.194.1">Background</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.195.1">: The background is the overview of the incident from detection to final disposition. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.195.2">A background of the incident should include how the CSIRT first became aware of the incident and what initial information was made available. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.195.3">Next, it should draw conclusions about the type and extent of the incident. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.195.4">The report should also include the impact on systems and what confidential information may have been compromised. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.195.5">Finally, it should include an overview of what containment strategy was utilized and how the systems were brought back to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.196.1">normal operation.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.197.1">Events timeline</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.198.1">: As the report moves from the background section to the events timeline, there is an increased focus on detail. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.198.2">The events timeline is best configured in a table format. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.198.3">For each action performed, an entry should be made in the timeline. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.198.4">The following table shows the level of detail that should </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.199.1">be included:</span></span></li>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.229.1">A key facet</span><a id="_idIndexMarker1122"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.230.1"> of the timeline to keep in mind is that entries will be put in place before those that indicate actions by the CSIRT. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.230.2">In the previous table, the Prefetch files will be analyzed with the intent of showing the execution of malware. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.230.3">These entries will obviously predate the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.231.1">CSIRT activity.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.232.1">This log may include several pages of entries, but it is critical to understand the sequence of events and how long it took to perform certain actions. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.232.2">This information can be utilized to recreate the sequence of events, but it can also be utilized to improve the incident response process by examining response and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.233.1">process times.</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.234.1">Network infrastructure overview</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.235.1">: If an incident has occurred that involves multiple systems across a network, it is good practice to include both a network diagram of the impacted systems and an overview of how systems are connected and how they communicate with each other. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.235.2">Other information, such as firewall rules that have a direct bearing on the incident, should also </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.236.1">be included.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.237.1">Forensic analysis overview</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.238.1">: Incidents that include the forensic analysis of logs, memory, or disk drives, an overview of the process, and the results should be included in the incident report. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.238.2">This allows stakeholders to understand what types of analyses were performed, as well as the results of that analysis, without having to navigate the very technical aspects of digital forensics. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.238.3">Analysts should ensure that conclusions reached via forensic analysis are included within this section. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.238.4">If the incident response team made extensive use of forensic techniques, these</span><a id="_idIndexMarker1123"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.239.1"> can be recorded in a separate report covered later in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.240.1">this chapter.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.241.1">Containment actions</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.242.1">: One of the key tasks of an incident response team is to limit the amount of damage to other systems when an incident has been detected. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.242.2">This portion of the report will state what types of containment actions were undertaken, such as powering off a system, removing its connectivity to the network, or limiting its access to the internet. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.242.3">Analysts should also ensure that the effectiveness of these measures is incorporated into the report. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.242.4">If, for example, it was difficult to administratively remove network access via accessing the switch, and a manual process had to be undertaken, knowledge of this fact will help the CSIRT create new processes that streamline this action and limit the ability of a compromised host accessing the other portions of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.243.1">the network.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.244.1">Findings/root cause analysis</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.245.1">: The meat of the report that is of most use to senior leadership and information technology personnel is the findings and, if it has been discovered, the root cause. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.245.2">This portion of the report should be comprehensive and incorporate elements of the timeline of events. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.245.3">Specific factors within hosts, software, hardware, and users that contributed to either a negative or positive outcome within the incident should be called out. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.245.4">If the specific exploit used by the attacker, or a vulnerability that was exploited, has been determined, then this should also be included. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.245.5">The overall goal of this portion of the report is to describe how the threat was able to compromise the infrastructure and lend credence to the remediation and recommendations </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.246.1">that follow.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.247.1">Remediation</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.248.1">: If steps were taken during the incident to remediate vulnerabilities or other deficiencies, they should be included. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.248.2">This allows the CSIRT to fully brief other IT personnel on the changes that were made to limit damage to the rest of the network so that they can then be placed into the normal change control procedures and vetted. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.248.3">This ensures that these changes do not have an adverse impact on other systems in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.249.1">the future.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.250.1">Final recommendations</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.251.1">: Any recommendations for improvements to the infrastructure, patching of vulnerabilities, or additional controls should be included in this section of the report. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.251.2">However, any recommendations should be based upon observations and a thorough analysis of the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.252.1">root cause.</span></span></li>

<ul>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.273.1">Examiner bio/background</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.274.1">: For audience members such as legal or external auditors, it is critical to have an idea of the background and qualifications of the forensic analysts. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.274.2">This background should include formal education, training, experience, and an overview of an analyst’s courtroom experience, which should include whether they were identified as an expert witness. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.274.3">A complete CV can be attached to the forensic report, especially if it is anticipated that the report will be used as part of a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.275.1">court case.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.276.1">Tools utilized</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.277.1">: The report should include a complete list of hardware and software tools that were utilized in the analysis of evidence. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.277.2">This information should include the make, model, and serial number of hardware, such as a physical write blocker, or the software name and version utilized for any software used. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.277.3">A further detail that can be included in the report is that all tools were up to date prior </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.278.1">to use.</span></span></li>

<ul>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.338.1">Conclusions</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.339.1">: Conclusions that are derived from the evidence can be included in the report. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.339.2">For example, if an analyst determines that a specific executable is malware by matching the hash with a known strain, and that this malware steals credentials, they are well within their bounds to make that conclusion. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.339.3">However, analysts should be cautious about supposition and making conclusions without the proper evidence to support them. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.339.4">Responders should be careful to never make assumptions or include opinions in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.340.1">the report.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.341.1">Definitions</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.342.1">: As the forensic report is very technical, it is important to include the necessary definitions. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.342.2">Internal stakeholders, such as legal representatives, will often review the report if legal action is anticipated. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.342.3">They may need further clarification on some of the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.343.1">technical details.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.344.1">Exhibits</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.345.1">: Output from tools that are too long to include within the body of the report can be included as an addendum. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.345.2">For example, if the output of a Volatility command is several pages long, but the most pertinent data is a single line; the analyst can pull that single line out and include it in the forensic analysis portion while making it clear that the entire output is located as an addendum. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.345.3">It is important to include the entire output of a tool as part of this report to ensure that it will stand up </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.346.1">to scrutiny.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.347.1">One of the key factors of the forensic report is to have a peer-review process before it is issued as part </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1133"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.348.1">of the incident documentation. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.348.2">This is to ensure that the actions that have been performed, the analysis, and the conclusions match the evidence. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.348.3">This is one of the reasons that analysts should include as much data as possible from the output of tools or through the review. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.348.4">If a forensic report does go to court, understand that an equally or even more qualified forensic analyst may be reviewing the report and critiquing the work. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.348.5">Another responder or analyst should be able to review the report, review the descriptions of the responder’s work, and come to the same conclusion. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.348.6">Knowing this may make analysts more focused on preparing </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.349.1">their reports.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.350.1">Whether or not an organization chooses to separate the documentation or prepare a master report, there is certain data that should be captured within the report. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.350.2">Having an idea of what this data is comprised of allows incident response personnel to ensure that they take the proper notes and record their observations while the incident investigation is in progress. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.350.3">Failure to do so may mean that any actions taken, or observations made, are not captured in the report. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.350.4">Furthermore, if the case is going to see the inside of a courtroom, evidence may be excluded. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.350.5">It is better to over-document </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.351.1">than under-document.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.357.1">To round out the discussion on reporting, there are two additional subjects that impact the overall reporting process. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.357.2">These two topics, note-taking, and how to ensure the proper language is included in the report. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.357.3">Analysts should pay particular attention to these two topics as they have a direct bearing on the quality of the report and how it can </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.358.1">be used.</span></span></p>

<ul>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.468.1">Conclusions with data</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.469.1">: It is fine for an analyst to have conclusions as we saw in crafting evaluative statements. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.469.2">This must be backed up with data. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.469.3">Any conclusion reached during the analysis and subsequent reporting needs to have firm data to back </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.470.1">it up.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.471.1">Don’t guess</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.472.1">: It is fine for an analyst to provide an expert-based opinion on a scenario that most likely happened if it is backed up by data. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.472.2">If evidence is missing, which does occur often, be honest and indicate that in the report. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.472.3">For example, an analyst may be investigating a ransomware incident and lack specific visibility into lateral movement techniques. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.472.4">They may indicate that they know from an analysis of ransomware threat actors that they utilize tools such as </span><strong class="source-inline"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.473.1">PSEXEC.exe</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.474.1"> or Remote Desktop Protocol along with compromised credentials, but due to the lack of logging, they are unable to determine the exact method of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.475.1">lateral movement.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.476.1">Repeatability</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.477.1">: A comprehensive and well-written technical report should be one where, given the same evidence, an analyst with no prior knowledge of the incident should be able to reconstruct your findings. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.477.2">This is especially true for law enforcement or analysts that may have to testify as the report and associated evidence will be provided to the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.478.1">other party.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.479.1">The language used in the report is often just as important as all the analysis work that goes into it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.479.2">A poorly written report with bad conclusions and improper language can have a negative </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1153"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.480.1">impression on the readers. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.480.2">In cases where the evidence </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1154"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.481.1">will be included as part of a civil or criminal proceeding, it is likely that all the work put in cannot be admitted. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.481.2">Analysts should develop good note-taking and writing along with their </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.482.1">technical skills.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.484.1">Incident response teams put a great deal of effort into preparing for and executing the tasks necessary to properly handle an incident. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.484.2">Of equal importance is properly documenting the incident so that decision-makers and the incident response team itself have a clear understanding of the actions taken and how the incident occurred. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.484.3">It is by using this documentation and analyzing a root cause that organizations can improve their security and reduce the risk of similar events taking place in the future. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.484.4">One area of major concern to incident responders and forensic analysts is the role that malware plays </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.485.1">in incidents.</span></span></p>
