			<h1 id="_idParaDest-152"><a id="_idTextAnchor306"/>Childproofing the Solution: Protection from the End-User and Their Environment</h1>&#13;
			<p><a id="_idTextAnchor307"/>This chapter will give you a crash course on child-proofing your appliance while ensuring a positive customer experience. Yeah. Both must be done in parallel. Delivering a masterful UI is absolutely a challenge that will require a little extra effort in the solution’s development. Just know in advance that your efforts here will pay back in adoption rates exponentially.</p>&#13;
			<p>In this chapter, you will learn crucial information like why locking the end-user out of the operating system is crucial to security. Additionally, you will gain an understanding of some key security concerns at the hardware level. We shall also review where the hosted applications themselves are solely what the end-users really need to access. Finally, we’ll wrap up the chapter by providing you with a deeper understanding of UI design implications that can enhance your appliance’s chances for success.</p>&#13;
			<p>This chapter has the following main headings:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>Introduction to childproofing (i.e., protecting the appliance from the end-user)</li>&#13;
				<li>Ensuring hardware-level protections</li>&#13;
				<li>Operating-system-level and application protections</li>&#13;
				<li>Building a UI to simplify configuration while providing a great User Experience (UX)</li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-153"><a id="_idTextAnchor308"/>Introduction to child-proofing (i.e., protecting the appliance from the end-user)</h1>&#13;
			<p>How to perform <strong class="bold">child-proofing</strong> of an<a id="_idIndexMarker403"/> appliance prototype is<a id="_idTextAnchor309"/> definitely one of my favorite conversations to have with product teams. Please indulge me and allow me to elaborate. This process may be the single greatest factor in determining what meets the definition of an appliance. All efforts to keep the final solution secure and focused solely on its predetermined function are crucial. The end-users must be properly guided on the initial setup requirements and kept within your guardrails of what you choose to allow them to access beyond the application/function of the appliance.</p>&#13;
			<p>There are many efforts to be considered here. How will my product’s end-users actually access the solution? What can be done to minimize or prevent any end-user from obtaining unauthorized elevated or root access? What automation will need to be put in place and obscured via the appliance’s UI?</p>&#13;
			<p>A prime example of what I am describing here is preventing the end-user from leveraging an escape key sequence to <em class="italic">escape</em> from your application regardless of whether it is console-based or graphical. I call this <em class="italic">No Escape!</em> This is achieved through thoughtful modification of the general console settings or editing a keymap. Of all the possible guardrails we will cover in this chapter, I consider this a mandatory first step.</p>&#13;
			<p>Let’s proceed onward to securing hardware access.<a id="_idTextAnchor310"/></p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-154"><a id="_idTextAnchor311"/>Ensuring hardware-level protections</h1>&#13;
			<p>Okay, I <a id="_idIndexMarker404"/>know that we’ve discussed this before, in <a href="B22104_08.xhtml#_idTextAnchor248"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></a> ... I feel that I must remind you that this is real. Ensuring that the end-user cannot change the configuration is key here. You have two main responsibilities in this realm. The first responsibility is the securing of the solution and the second responsibility is prevention of the end-user from controlling the operating system. By achieving both, you guarantee that your team controls the end-user experience.</p>&#13;
			<p>If you create a user interface that simplifies how your appliance can operate securely, ultimately the appliance will be easy to use yet the end-user need not know how it works. I implore you to consider all these factors. Remove the end-user from all access to the operating system.</p>&#13;
			<p>Create an experience where the end-user can trust that you have achieved, above all else, a secure but user-friendly platform. This is truly the field of dreams. This is what we all aspire to create. This should be our legacy.</p>&#13;
			<p>Hardware security <a id="_idIndexMarker405"/>is something we have covered in quite some depth. Yet still, I feel that we must revisit this conversation, if just briefly. So, let’s dive in. Forgive me in advance, but I will reiterate a few details in this chapter. This is meant to protect you and your solution. So, let’s now move on to how to properly configure your BIOS setting<a id="_idTextAnchor312"/>s.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-155"><a id="_idTextAnchor313"/>Tamper-proofing with BIOS security</h2>&#13;
			<p>In this<a id="_idIndexMarker406"/> section, I want to reinforce what I have been building upon for many chapters up to this point. Choose your security settings carefully. Please understand the pros and cons of each configuration option. Not every setting will offer the best outcome. Some, if not most, have caveats as we have reviewed and we shall continue to dive deeper.</p>&#13;
			<p>Choosing to lock down the BIOS admin password is a double-edged sword. Yes, you can completely ensure that the end-user cannot change anything in the BIOS… But… That also ensures that your support team is in the business of replacing a unit – not servicing it remotely. Feel free to revisit <a href="B22104_08.xhtml#_idTextAnchor248"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></a> if you need more ideas on BIOS and boot security functions.</p>&#13;
			<p>This is where your support plan is crucial. Know what it is and own it. Let’s move on to the next hardware security opti<a id="_idTextAnchor314"/>on.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-156"><a id="_idTextAnchor315"/>USB disablement</h2>&#13;
			<p>I’m on the<a id="_idIndexMarker407"/> fence about this security precaution and method of tamper-proofing and I’ll elaborate why. Disabling the USB ports on a system, whether through a BIOS setting or via the operating system, can be an elaborate security measure or one that perpetually guarantees your support model is not one of troubleshooting but of direct replacement. Elimination of the ability to connect a device (like a USB thumb drive) adds another layer of security by preventing data transfer, unauthorized booting to a different OS, or the running of code on the device that your team has never authorized.</p>&#13;
			<p>Choosing this level of security is a significant decision. Or… Maybe it’s not. For some solutions, the decision to disable USB is a no-brainer. Let’s use a couple of examples here to state a case for the disablement of any possible external USB ports on the chassis of the solution.</p>&#13;
			<p>The first example is a hypothetical mobile ventilator used by hospitals and ambulance crews and with other installations across the healthcare industry. It has an LED display and all of its controls are built into a touch screen. Disabling the USB ports is a pure tamper-proofing effort. As most of these ventilators might never be attached to a network or be left waiting in hallways and closets for that all-too-crucial moment when their services are needed, tamper-proofing is critical. These machines are subject to government scrutiny and certification. So, updates are left to trained personnel anyway.</p>&#13;
			<p>My second<a id="_idIndexMarker408"/> hypothetical example is a visual targeting system in a military vehicle. This appliance has its own display and custom hardwired controls. USB disablement is implied as this appliance will never be updated nor maintained in the field and will only receive service from trained engineers when the vehicle itself goes into the maintenance depot by those who work for the firm that built the solution. Field soldiers have no access, nor should they have access to the underlying system.</p>&#13;
			<p>So that’s plenty of reasons in the <em class="italic">pro</em> bucket. Here’s a couple for the <em class="italic">con</em> bucket. I’ll use the example of a medical imaging system. It could be an MRI or a CAT scanner – one of those hypotheticals. These are complex yet very well-maintained systems. They must be. They are not maintained by the hospitals that own (or lease) them. Regular maintenance is part of the support agreement when one acquires such an expensive toy. On average, these complex solutions are maintained on a monthly or quarterly schedule by field engineers who are sent by the manufacturer. These support engineers will absolutely need USB access to run diagnostics, patching operations, etc. The hospital staff is not remotely involved in this and these systems are kept in secure rooms with limited access, so tampering is far less of a concern.</p>&#13;
			<p>My second example is a patient monitoring solution appliance for healthcare that requires a persistent connection with a keyboard, mouse, and, more importantly, a specified USB speaker that is used to alert the nurses at the nurses’ station.</p>&#13;
			<p>My final example against the disabling of USB ports applies to any physical appliance where perhaps the normal UI is delivered through a kiosk-like touch screen. If there is to be any support activity on said device, a physical keyboard and mouse may be needed to simply<a id="_idIndexMarker409"/> navigate the interface until help from support can remediate a situation. This is just an oversimplification of how I believe that, at a minimum, allowing for a keyboard and mouse to connect may always be necessary.</p>&#13;
			<p>For this set of security precautions, I trust that you and your team will weigh the pros and cons. Let’s move on to the next tamper-proofing o<a id="_idTextAnchor316"/>ption.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-157"><a id="_idTextAnchor317"/>Case tamper-proofing</h2>&#13;
			<p>This is an<a id="_idIndexMarker410"/> option with limited value in the end game. Very few hardware manufacturers have enabled this level of detail. To determine if your end-user has actually opened a case without your permission or guidance is an effort in futility.</p>&#13;
			<p>I say, who cares if they open up the system’s case? If your team has properly locked down the operating system and the BIOS, there’s little, if anything, a malicious actor can do to break the system. They surely will not be able to add new hardware without your help. Nor should they ever be allowed to do so.</p>&#13;
			<p>At best, this will only be highlighted when the case has been <em class="italic">opened</em> by displaying a message at the system’s boot time (assuming one can even see the console) ... For this type of lockdown, if your hardware even supports it, you (and your team) wouldn’t know, and the end-user might have the ability to erase this altogether from any logs if, in fact, there is nothing preventing them from entering and altering the BIOS settings.</p>&#13;
			<p>Oddly enough, this is where technology vendors could take a hint from the transportation industry – more specifically, trucking and shipping. Your enclosure will require something like a lock or anti-tamper clamp or numbered tag to prevent the end-user from opening the case (somewhat). Some examples are easily obtained via Amazon. Anything like this could greatly enhance and protect your product from being tampered with. I would recommend having something like the examples custom-made. You should consider two pieces of information to be placed on the tag itself. First, place a serial number that you track internally that is bound to the hardware that you sold that customer. Secondly, have a warning that breaking the seal invalidates any warranties (for your protection).</p>&#13;

			</ul>&#13;
			<p>As there are<a id="_idIndexMarker411"/> a few ways of tamper-proofing your case and protecting the hardware itself, I will humbly acknowledge that not all methods may be appropriate for your solution. Choose wisely. Let’s now move forward to how you might look into locking down the operating system for your s<a id="_idTextAnchor318"/>olution.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-158"><a id="_idTextAnchor319"/>Operating-system-level and application protections</h1>&#13;
			<p>Right, here’s<a id="_idIndexMarker412"/> where things might get a wee bit complicated. I know you may feel a bit of apprehension when I make such a statement. So, with that in mind, I offer this disclaimer: I do not know your application. How could I? I (and you) must trust that your team does.</p>&#13;
			<p>In this section, I am going to challenge you and your team to build a comprehensive interface that isn’t just for your application but user access, updates, etc. The more that you can obscure with your application/user interface the more secure your appliance will be. This, along with the next few sections, are dedicated to how you can make that happen. This challenge I present to you may ultimately determine the success or failure of your product. The more effort you put forth in providing a rich and enjoyable user experience, the more likely the end customers are to applaud your product and adopt it wholesale.</p>&#13;
			<p>These actions are not just for security but can absolutely create a rich and enjoyable end-user experience. Let’s dive into a few of these fac<a id="_idTextAnchor320"/>tors now.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-159"><a id="_idTextAnchor321"/>Minimizing access to root</h2>&#13;
			<p>By <a id="_idIndexMarker413"/>definition, an appliance should be easy to use but not require the end-user to be vastly skilled in the intricacies of managing the application nor the operating system. These factors are implied. If the end-user’s organization had the skills (or the desire) to maintain such solutions, they ultimately would have built them themselves.</p>&#13;
			<p>Hence, my recommendations are brutally prescriptive in this thought process. I cringe as I write this, yet I feel that you should adopt this mentality as well. It will ultimately protect your support team from countless unnecessary calls. Tamper-proof your solution. Yes, I just said it. The more you prevent the end-user from directly accessing the operating system, the more secure your solution will be.</p>&#13;
			<p>Failing to do so and an end-user acquiring root access could create a significant emotional event for your appliance. At this point, they can do anything they want with your appliance. Shall I list some of the horrors that could be created? Oh, yes. I shall.</p>&#13;
			<p>If you have an end-user that has root access, they could possibly carry out any of the following acts with or without malicious intent:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>Add or remove software</li>&#13;
				<li>Alter the system’s configuration</li>&#13;
				<li>Add or remove users from the system or applications</li>&#13;
				<li>Remove security precautions or configurations</li>&#13;
				<li>Alter or delete logs to cover their tracks (or delete logging altogether)</li>&#13;
				<li>Make a change in the system that renders your appliance unusable for the purpose it was procured for</li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>I haven’t even really mentioned the truly evil, malicious activities that could possibly occur. For those, I will allow your imagination to roam free. Enjoy! Perhaps now you understand why I implore you and your team to take every reasonable step to protect your solutions.</p>&#13;
			<p>Regardless <a id="_idIndexMarker414"/>of how your solution is accessed or interacted with, having these settings obscured from all end-users and handled behind the scenes will guarantee the security and stability (hopefully the longevity too) of you<a id="_idTextAnchor322"/>r solution.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-160"><a id="_idTextAnchor323"/>SUDO and restricting console access</h2>&#13;
			<p>Depending <a id="_idIndexMarker415"/>on how exactly your solution is designed and implemented, this next recommendation may not be feasible. Well… at least as it might have been originally envisioned. Please open your mind. I’m trying to save you from future pain.</p>&#13;
			<p>This is where I’m going to reiterate some best practices that I hope you already know. Minimize or totally eliminate end-user access directly to the operating system. An appliance <em class="italic">SHOULD</em> be a black box. The end-users should only have access to the services for which the solution was designed to create, along with any administrative tasks not already automated by the solution.</p>&#13;
			<p>For the administrative tasks, I feel it is paramount to obscure and remove the end-user from directly accessing operating system too. Giving your user base root access will literally ensure that, at some point, some malicious (or accidental) end-users will break something intentionally, reverse engineer the solution, or – even worse – reconfigure the system to do malicious activities.</p>&#13;
			<p>So, how can we achieve this? It’s not difficult actually. Behind your graphical or web UI, have scripts that are run as a non-root user account that has restricted sudo capabilities. That’s the easiest way to keep the user out of the OS or the shell.</p>&#13;
			<p>But what if the end-user can log into the system and has terminal access... Limit what they can see. Limit what they can execute. Ensure that what they are allowed to execute is controlled by ACLs, SUID, SGID, and other mechanisms set within the files’ permissions. Furthermore, I would present a limited interface (even if shell-based) to any user who has access to the system, with the only exception being the access you have created for your support personnel (if any).</p>&#13;
			<p>In this, the end-user can be seen as an enemy – willing or accidental. Hence, every effort that you can create within your interfaces to prevent direct operating systems access should be seen as mandatory. Le<a id="_idTextAnchor324"/>t’s move on.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-161"><a id="_idTextAnchor325"/>Non-interactive LUKS encryption</h2>&#13;
			<p>We <a id="_idIndexMarker416"/>have covered several ways of ensuring disk encryption (without end-user interaction) extensively in <em class="italic">Chapters 6</em> and <em class="italic">7</em>; however, I would feel remiss in not mentioning it again, as this is also seen as another way to child-proof one’s solution.</p>&#13;
			<p>In using automated disk encryption, you take the responsibility out of the end-user’s hands, along with the access to alter it maliciously. Not automating this creates a poor end-user experience and leaves your solution vulnerable. As I know that you already understand my point, I’ll say l<a id="_idTextAnchor326"/>et’s move on.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-162"><a id="_idTextAnchor327"/>Keeping users in the application space</h2>&#13;
			<p>What <a id="_idIndexMarker417"/>does he mean by keeping the users in the application space? Good question. For that, I have a great recommendation. Please allow me to elaborate.</p>&#13;
			<p>Another great way of ultimately preventing your application or your end-users from compromising the operating system is to keep all the end-users as application-level users, not operating-system-level users. In doing this, your applications’ interface is all they can interact with – forever. By this, I mean the end-user only has a user account in your application stack, which is controlled by the application, not within Linux itself. This prevents the end-user from ever accessing a command-line shell.</p>&#13;
			<p>Think of this in the same manner as application sandboxing... but we’re doing it with the end-users... It’s a great layer of separation that adds a protective layer of security to your solution.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-163"><a id="_idTextAnchor328"/>Application auto-launch at boot</h2>&#13;
			<p>Ensuring that <a id="_idIndexMarker418"/>your interface and applications automatically start up at boot is assumed, but I recommend taking it a step further. Run them <a id="_idIndexMarker419"/>with <strong class="bold">systemd</strong> as a non-root user.</p>&#13;
			<p>Here’s an example of how to set up systemd <a id="_idIndexMarker420"/>and <code>myapplication</code>. Enabling linger allows for the application or <a id="_idIndexMarker421"/>service to run appropriately under a non-root user’s login without interactions.</p>&#13;
			<p>Start and enable your application:</p>&#13;
			<pre class="console">&#13;
$ systemctl --user start myapplication.service&#13;
$ systemctl --user enable myapplication.service</pre>			<p>To ensure the service runs even when the <code>$USER</code> is not logged in, we’ll need to use <code>linger</code>. Remember that <code>$USER</code> is the user account you want to run your applications/services: as.</p>&#13;
			<pre class="console">&#13;
$ sudo loginctl enable-linger $USER</pre>			<p>Now your application will run as the defined user at each startup sequence without any elevated or root access. By employing the customizations detailed in this section, we’ve taken more steps to ensure system security and stability. Now let’s move on and look into how we can provide a great user experience whilst <a id="_idTextAnchor329"/>ensuring security.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-164"><a id="_idTextAnchor330"/>Building a UI to simplify configuration while providing a great User Experience (UX)</h1>&#13;
			<p>At some point, your <a id="_idIndexMarker422"/>prospective customers have made the executive decision to seek a commercially ready solution to a problem that they have encountered. This fateful decision was whether to build a solution in-house versus buying one built by someone else. This truly is an important fact to keep in mind. At some point – hopefully soon – someone will choose to buy your future product!</p>&#13;
			<p>Honor those who make that decision by giving them a positive and rewarding <strong class="bold">User Experience</strong> (<strong class="bold">UX</strong>). Delivering<a id="_idIndexMarker423"/> them a secure solution is simply implied. They have placed their trust in your company even more if your solution is a security-services-focused appliance. Trust, in this case, also equals responsibility. Your team is responsible for creating an appliance that doesn’t need the customers’ IT staff to be rocket scientists, or perhaps even an IT staff at all, to assist with the consumption of services from your solution. I challenge you to go beyond that and deliver to the end-customers an interface that goes above and beyond in the following areas:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>Exceeds all expectations in terms of intuitiveness (i.e., the users can navigate with ease)</li>&#13;
				<li>Provides the proper number of details to the end-user and doesn’t over-burden them with administration concerns</li>&#13;
				<li>Accounts for all support and configuration needs that could arise so as the end-user should never need to get direct access to the operating system</li>&#13;
				<li>Provides the end-users with the ability to consume the appliance’s functionality without extensive training</li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>A secure and <a id="_idIndexMarker424"/>successful appliance experience can be highlighted by how much planning and automation goes into its interface. These decisions are made early in the design phase and are implemented here. Regardless of how the user interacts with the appliance, obscuring or totally removing the operating system from the user base is crucial. Let’s explore some examples of bo<a id="_idTextAnchor331"/>th text and web UI’s.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-165"><a id="_idTextAnchor332"/>Initial config – text UI</h2>&#13;
			<p>For this set of <a id="_idIndexMarker425"/>example screens, I’ll be showing you a bare-bones text UI for an initial configuration of an appliance. For argument’s sake, let’s assume the end-user has a keyboard connected and has console access.</p>&#13;
			<p>For this <a id="_idIndexMarker426"/>type of initial configuration UI, you’ll need to set, at minimum, a non-root user for them to log in as and, hopefully, upon the login as this user, they are given only the ability to run this simple setup utility.</p>&#13;
			<p>Our first screenshot here simulates a welcome screen for the end-user. You may also want to add in other friendly messages like <em class="italic">Thank you for choosing us…</em> or something similar.</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div>&#13;
					<img src="img/B22104_10_01.jpg" alt="Figure 10.1 – Text UI – welcome screen" width="553" height="274"/>&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 10.1 – Text UI – welcome screen</p>&#13;
			<p>Once past<a id="_idIndexMarker427"/> the <a id="_idIndexMarker428"/>welcome screen, the end-user would be presented with a main menu of configuration options.</p>&#13;
			<p>&#13;
				<div>&#13;
					<img src="img/B22104_10_02.jpg" alt="Figure 10.2 – Text UI – main menu" width="471" height="522"/>&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 10.2 – Text UI – main menu</p>&#13;
			<p>Let’s also assume this<a id="_idIndexMarker429"/> appliance serves some function on a network. So, let’s help the end-user define the network settings. They will simply give the attribute <a id="_idIndexMarker430"/>values and your automation behind the scenes is what really makes the configuration changes, limiting what the end-user can access and do – no root access.</p>&#13;
			<p>So, these next few screens will show the interactions where the end-user defines the network settings and is eventually asked to confirm them so they can be saved and applied.</p>&#13;
			<p>The first setting the user may be prompted for is the appliance’s hostname.</p>&#13;

			<p>So, there you<a id="_idIndexMarker439"/> have it – a simple network configuration for a text-based <a id="_idIndexMarker440"/>appliance. Try to keep things as simple as possible yet consider adding all facets of your appliance’s usage and configuration to such a menu system. Obscure all operating system operations, whilst protecting the system from the end-user as well.</p>&#13;
			<p>Let’s move on to what a simulated minimal web configur<a id="_idTextAnchor333"/>ation interface may look like.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-166"><a id="_idTextAnchor334"/>Initial config – web UI</h2>&#13;
			<p>Web-based<a id="_idIndexMarker441"/> interfaces<a id="_idIndexMarker442"/> allow for a much more aesthetically pleasing experience but require more programming. You’ll still be collecting the same information as the text UI did but instead of instantly calling sudo scripts, the web UI will leverage sudo scripts called by <code>cgi-bin GET</code> or <code>POST</code> operations. I’m not remotely going to teach you how to program webpages as there are literally hundreds of books that could do a better job at that than I could.</p>&#13;
			<p>I will, however, mention<a id="_idIndexMarker443"/> that for the initial configuration, you should consider leveraging a pre-defined and documented IP address for the new end-user to access your initial setup pages.</p>&#13;
			<p>In the new <a id="_idIndexMarker444"/>few screenshots, we’ll be looking at a simulated walk-through of a simplified web UI for the initial appliance configuration.</p>&#13;
			<p>Let’s start with a welcome webpage. Greet your new customer and let them know the system is working! This page politely indicates that we will need to do some basic configuration work before the end-user can begin to consume the services this appliance provides.</p>&#13;
			<p>&#13;
				<div>&#13;
					<img src="img/B22104_10_08.jpg" alt="Figure 10.8 – Web UI – welcome screen" width="1227" height="345"/>&#13;
				</p>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 10.8 – Web UI – welcome screen</p>&#13;
			<p>From the welcome page, we select <strong class="bold">Start Initial Configuration</strong> and enter a simulated main menu with simple navigation selections available on a sidebar. From here, the end-user is presented with several obvious options that should also remain available beyond the initial configuration event.</p>&#13;
			<p>In this main configuration menu, the end-user will have some key options that should be planned for accordingly – administrative access, user access, network configuration, factory reset, and, of course, a way to process updates.</p>&#13;
			<p>As the end-user is<a id="_idIndexMarker445"/> anxious to get started using this appliance, logical first steps include guiding the end-user to set an admin password and then configure the networking/hostname.</p>&#13;
			<p>In this<a id="_idIndexMarker446"/> example, we’ll see what a simplified web-based UI for an appliance’s administration main menu should contain at a minimum.</p>&#13;
			<p>&#13;
				<div>&#13;
					<img src="img/B22104_10_09.jpg" alt="Figure 10.9 – Web UI – main appliance configuration menu" width="838" height="813"/>&#13;
				</p>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 10.9 – Web UI – main appliance configuration menu</p>&#13;
			<p>Assume that we had selected <strong class="bold">Network Configuration</strong> here and we want to set up the basic networking settings for this appliance. Basic needs for this type of initial configuration should always include not just network configuration but also having the ability for the end-user to assign a proper hostname so that the system can also be referenced by their own DNS systems.</p>&#13;
			<p>&#13;
				<div>&#13;
					<img src="img/B22104_10_10.jpg" alt="" width="1210" height="669"/>&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="IMG---Figure">Fig 10.10 – Web UI – network configuration</p>&#13;
			<p>Now that we’ve <a id="_idIndexMarker447"/>guided our new end-user through a crisp basic appliance configuration process, they<a id="_idIndexMarker448"/> can leverage your product for all the great services it provides them. Eventually, as with any computer system nowadays, the appliance will require patching and updates, which leads us to our next section.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-167"><a id="_idTextAnchor335"/>Update controls – text UI</h2>&#13;
			<p>Your <a id="_idIndexMarker449"/>appliance’s end-user experience would not be<a id="_idIndexMarker450"/> complete unless you add in a method for the appliance to get updated. By updates, I refer to operating systems bug fixes and enhancements, application patches and enhancements, new features, and even firmware updates if your solution is physical.</p>&#13;
			<p>Creating this type of interface also creates a boundary layer from what the end-user can do and what the appliance can do for itself. We must remove any possible need or excuse for any end-user to demand access directly to the operating system itself.</p>&#13;
			<p>Depending on the use case and deployment methodology, the interface should account for how updates are to be presented. Air-gapped systems will not be able to go out to the internet and check for their updates, so the interface should be able to ingest updates alternatively. USB thumb drives, tarballs, and ISO images are all examples of ways that one could deliver <a id="_idIndexMarker451"/>updates to the end-user, however, the end-user would then need to deliver them to the interface and the appliance should process them without the end-user having access to the operating system.</p>&#13;
			<p>Here’s an <a id="_idIndexMarker452"/>example of what appliance update controls may look like in a text UI, where the appliance has access to the internet to check for its updates.</p>&#13;
			<p>&#13;
				<div>&#13;
					<img src="img/B22104_10_11.jpg" alt="Figure 10.11 – Text UI update menu" width="500" height="450"/>&#13;
				</p>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 10.11 – Text UI update menu</p>&#13;
			<p>Now that we’ve addressed the fundamental needs of being able to provide updates to our appliances, we can move on to our next crucial end-user function: appliance resets.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-168"><a id="_idTextAnchor336"/>Factory reset controls</h2>&#13;
			<p>Every good appliance <a id="_idIndexMarker453"/>should have a way of resetting itself back to its factory-new persona. Creating this experience for the end-users will also make it much simpler for them to reprovision an appliance onto a different network or location within their organization, by removing any stored application data or previous configuration. This type of functionality also gives the customers peace of mind that their possibly sensitive data has been erased if they are shipping a unit back to your company. The next screenshots will show examples of what this could look like on a text UI and webpage.</p>&#13;
			<p>Let’s start with an example web UI reset function page. This page would present a two-step process that ensures they really know that the machine will go back to a brand-new state (all data and configuration erased). To achieve this state, they would first have to check the checkbox in the interface and then press the <strong class="bold">RESET</strong> button.</p>&#13;
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>&#13;
			<p class="callout">I would also recommend having a pop-up window asking them to confirm that yet again if you really want to be user-friendly.</p>&#13;
			<p>&#13;
				<div>&#13;
					<img src="img/B22104_10_12.jpg" alt="Figure 10.12 – Webpage factory reset example" width="1006" height="515"/>&#13;
				</p>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 10.12 – Webpage factory reset example</p>&#13;
			<p>And here’s an example reset in a text UI. The end-user is presented with a prompt to confirm that they really want to reset the appliance back to its factory-new configuration <a id="_idIndexMarker454"/>and erase all data. Just like with the web example shown previously, they always have the ability to simply cancel the operation.</p>&#13;
			<p>&#13;

			<p>I trust that these simulations of functions needed in your future UI have been insightful. Yours, of course, will <a id="_idIndexMarker455"/>obviously look far more refined and be well in line with your company’s branding guidelines for your products. By establishing a secure UI/end-user environment, you’ve ensured another factor of security for your solution – tamper-proofing. Let’s now move on to our end-of-chapter summary.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-169"><a id="_idTextAnchor337"/>Summary</h1>&#13;
			<p>Thanks again for driving onward on this journey with me. In this chapter, we’ve reviewed why locking down our appliances is vital. We have recapped some hardware and storage security options to consider. Best of all, we’ve identified key ways of ensuring a great user experience while maintaining security by obscuring the operating system access away from the end-user.</p>&#13;
