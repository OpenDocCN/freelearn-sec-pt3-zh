			<p>This book is a practical guide to the Ghidra reverse engineering tool. Throughout it, you will learn, from zero, how to use Ghidra for different purposes, such as malware analysis and binary auditing. As you progress through the initial chapters, you will also learn how to automate time-consuming reverse engineering tasks using Ghidra scripting and how to check the documentation to solve doubts and expand your knowledge on your own.</p>&#13;
			<p>After reading the initial chapters, once you become an advanced Ghidra user, you will learn how to extend the capabilities of this reverse engineering tool to support new GUI plugins, binary formats, processor modules, and so on. After that part of the book, you will acquire Ghidra development skills, being able to debug Ghidra and develop your own features extending Ghidra at your pleasure.</p>&#13;
			<p>After that, there is an entire chapter dedicated to learning how to contribute to the Ghidra community where you will learn how to offer your own code, feedback, found bugs, and so on to the <strong class="bold">National Security Agency</strong> (<strong class="bold">NSA</strong>) project, apart from interacting with other community members.</p>&#13;
			<p>In the last chapter of the book, advanced reverse engineering topics will be introduced to open your mind to an extremely interesting world, being able to wonder about new useful Ghidra features you can develop to improve the Ghidra reverse engineering tool.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-8"><a id="_idTextAnchor007"/>Who this book is for</h1>&#13;
			<p>This book is intended to be read by reverse code engineers, malware analysts, bug hunters, penetration testers, exploit developers, forensic practitioners, security researchers, and cybersecurity students. In fact, any person who wants to learn Ghidra by minimizing the learning curve and starting to write their own tools, for sure, will enjoy the book and accomplish their goal.</p>&#13;
