- en: 'At the outset of writing *Learning Python for Forensics*, we had one goal:
    to teach the use of Python for forensics in such a way that readers with little
    to no programming experience could follow along immediately and develop practical
    code for use in casework. That''s not to say that this book is intended for the
    Python neophyte; throughout, we ease the reader into progressively more challenging
    code and end by incorporating many of the scripts in previous chapters into a
    forensic framework. This book makes a few assumptions about the reader''s programming
    experience, and where it does, there will often be a detailed explanation with
    examples and a list of resources to help bridge the gap in knowledge.'

- en: The majority of the book will focus on developing code for various forensic
    artifacts; however, the first two chapters will teach the basics of the language.
    This will level the playing field for readers of all skill levels. We intend for
    the complete Python novice to be able to develop forensically sound and relevant
    scripts by the end of this book.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Much like in the real world, code development will follow a modular design.
    Initially, a script might be written one way before rewritten in another to show
    off the advantages (or disadvantages) of various techniques. Immersing you in
    this fashion will help build and strengthen the neural links required to retain
    the process of script design. To allow Python development to become second nature,
    please retype the exercises shown throughout the chapters for yourself to practice
    and learn common Python tropes. Never be afraid to modify the code, you will not
    break anything (except maybe your version of the script) and will have a better
    understanding of the inner workings of the code as a result.

    every examiner''s friend. We use the struct module to parse binary data into Python
    objects from a forensically-relevant source. We will parse the UserAssist key
    in the registry for user application execution artifacts.'
