    that are used only in cases when you cannot get the intended result using other
    methods. For example, you can use the method (chip-off) for extracting data from
    physical damaged devices or water damaged devices. Also, these methods are used
    when a mobile device is not supported by commercial mobile forensics tools or
    when you need to examine a damaged mobile device or even a fragment of it that
    has a memory chip.

    Test Action Group (JTAG) is a standard used for testing system boards. There is
    a contact pad on a system board. Using the JTAG interface, you cannot only test
    a system board, but you can also make a physical dump of a memory chip. This method
    is not destructive. The examined mobile device has to be in working order if you
    want to use this method.'

    memory chip from the system board. Then the data from the memory chip can be extracted
    via the programmer unit or via a special adapter. Using this method, you read
    information directly from the memory chip that allows examining hardly damaged
    mobile devices or parts of mobile devices. The use of the programmer or adapter
    is determined by the type of the memory chip. Although the sizes of the memory
    chips are standardized, there are many different form factors and due to this
    fact, an expert has to have a lot of different expensive adapters for this method.
    After removing the memory chip from the mobile device, it will be impossible to
    use this device.'

    of the JTAG method. Flashers are devices for flashing mobile devices. Unfortunately,
    there is no flasher with which you could make a physical dump of any mobile device.
    As a rule, a flasher supports only devices of one manufacturer (Samsung, LG, Motorola,
    and so on) or even several models of the same manufacturer. For this reason ,
    you have to be ready to buy or rent a flasher to make a physical dump of the examined
    mobile device.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are adapters for some flashers, which are used for the connection of flashers
    to the system boards of mobile devices. It is recommended to purchase such adapters,
    as they reduce the time spent on the connection of the flasher to the mobile device.
    Moreover, in modern mobile devices, the density of JTAG contacts is so high that
    there is no other option but to connect a flasher to a system board via an adapter.

- en: Most of the memory chips that are used in mobile devices have eMMC (embedded
    MMC) types. These chips are used when the memory chips are soldered to the system
    boards of devices. These memory chips have the same interface as SD cards. That
    is why you can read the information from this kind of memory card just by soldering
    the memory card pinouts to the pinouts of your card reader. However, it is more
    convenient to do it using specialized adapters. As memory chips have different
    sizes, companies specializing in the distribution of equipment for data extraction
    from eMMC chips sell such adapters in sets. For example, you can buy a set of
    adapters with the SMARTPHONE KIT from the Rusolut company, the use of which will
    almost guarantee that you will be able to read information from any memory chip.
    Also, a similar set of adapters is included in the PC-3000 MOBILE set of the ACE
    lab company. You can buy adapters separately or sets of adapters from the Allsocket
    company.

    in a certain sequence, avoiding overheating. The heating temperature should be
    sufficient to melt the solder, with which the chip is soldered to the system board.
    If the solder is not melted, you will damage the chip during the process of removing
    it. If you overheat the chip, the data on the chip will be lost. You need to use
    a soldering station with a wide nozzle and temperature sensor, which has to be
    placed on the chip to control its temperature. You can find heating modes for
    particular chips on the internet.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'If you cannot find the heating mode to your chip, we recommend the following: 
    heat the chip for 2 minutes at the temperature of 100 degrees Celsius. Then heat
    the chip for 5 minutes at the temperature of 230 degrees Celsius. Hold the nozzle
    of the soldering station as close to the chip as possible. This is important,
    because when the distance between the nozzle and the chip increases, the temperature
    of hot air drops rapidly. It is important not to miss the moment when the small
    components located next to the memory chip on the system board will begin to shift.
    This indicates that the solder under the memory chip has melted. However, you
    will not be able to remove the chip yet, as the chip is not only soldered, but
    also glued to the system board with epoxy resin. When you see that the solder
    has melted, put the back of a utility knife to any side of the chip and press
    firmly, inserting the blade between the system board and the chip. If you press
    the knife too hard it may lead to mechanical damage of the chip and the examination
    will be impossible:'

    chip-off technique. This is the truth and a lie at the same time. The thing is
    that starting from iPhone 3GS, Apple mobile devices are encrypted, meaning that
    the use of the chip-off method does not make any sense. Some experts suggest to
    use the brute force method to decrypt physical dumps of Apple devices. However,
    if you are familiar with the Apple iOS Security document, you will understand

    100 degrees Celsius. Then heat the chip for 5 minutes at the temperature of 230
    degrees Celsius. Hold the nozzle of the soldering station as close to the chip
    as possible; it is important, because when the distance between the nozzle and
    the chip increases, the temperature of hot air drops rapidly. If you did everything
    correctly, the chip should be easily removed from the system board:'

    unit designed to work with such chips. Place the chip on the programmer unit’s
    pad and read the data from the chip to the file via the control program of the
    programming tool.

    extracted from the chip, which contain additional information. These headers interfere
    with the analysis of the dump via mobile forensics tools. Also, the entire memory
    area of the chip is divided into segments that are interconnected as RAID. However,
    it is not a big problem. The ACE Lab company has a solution base, where it describes
    how to properly configure the extracted data so it is available for further analysis:'
