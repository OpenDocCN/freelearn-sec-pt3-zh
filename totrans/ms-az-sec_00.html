			<p>Security is always integrated into a cloud platform and this causes users to let their guard down as they take cloud security for granted. Cloud computing brings new security challenges, but you can overcome these with Microsoft Azure's shared responsibility model.</p>
			<p><em class="italic">Mastering Azure Security</em> covers the latest security features provided by Microsoft to identify different threats and protect your Azure cloud using innovative techniques. The book takes you through the built-in security controls and the multi-layered security features offered by Azure to protect cloud workloads across apps and networks. You'll get to grips with using Azure Security Center for unified security management, building secure applications on Azure, protecting the cloud from DDoS attacks, safeguarding sensitive information with Azure Key Vault, and much more. Additionally, the book covers Azure Sentinel, monitoring and auditing, Azure security and governance best practices, and secure resource deployments.</p>
			<p>By the end of this book, you'll have developed a solid understanding of cybersecurity in the cloud and be able to design secure solutions in Microsoft Azure.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-8"><a id="_idTextAnchor011"/>Who this book is for?</h1>
			<p>This book is for Azure cloud professionals, Azure architects, and security professionals looking to implement safe and secure cloud services using Azure Security Center and other Azure security features. A fundamental understanding of security concepts and prior exposure to the Azure cloud will assist with understanding the key concepts covered in the book.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-9"><a id="_idTextAnchor012"/>What this book covers</h1>
			<p><a href="B15414_01_Final_JM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor021"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a>, <em class="italic">Introduction to Azure Security</em>, covers how the cloud is changing the concept of IT, and security is not an exception. Cybersecurity requires a different approach in the cloud and we need to understand what the differences are, new threats, and how to tackle them.</p>
			<p><a href="B15414_02_Final_JM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor038"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>, <em class="italic">Governance and Security</em>, goes into how to create policies and rules in Microsoft Azure in order to create standards, enforcing these policies and rules, and maintaining quality levels.</p>
			<p><a href="B15414_03_Final_JM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor060"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></a>, <em class="italic">Managing Cloud Identities</em>, explains why identity is one of the most important parts of security. With the cloud, identity is even more expressed than ever before. You'll learn how to keep identities secure and safe in Microsoft Azure and how to keep track of access rights and monitor any anomalies in user behavior.</p>
			<p><a href="B15414_04_Final_JM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor087"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></a>, <em class="italic">Azure Network Security</em>, covers how the network is the first line of defense in any environment. Keeping resources safe and unreachable by attackers is a very important part of security. You'll learn how to achieve this in Microsoft Azure with built-in or custom tools.</p>
			<p><a href="B15414_05_Final_JM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor099"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></a>, <em class="italic">Azure KeyVault</em>, explains how to manage secrets and certificates in Azure and deploy resources to Microsoft Azure with Infrastructure as Code in a secure way.</p>
			<p><a href="B15414_06_Final_JM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor111"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>, <em class="italic">Data Security</em>, covers how to protect data in the cloud with additional encryption using Microsoft or your own encryption key.</p>
			<p><a href="B15414_07_Final_JM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor119"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></a>, <em class="italic">Azure Security Center</em>, explains how to use ASC to detect threats in Microsoft Azure and how to view assessments, reports, and recommendations in order to increase Azure tenant security. It also looks at how to increase VM security by enabling just-in-time access.</p>
			<p><a href="B15414_08_Final_JM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor132"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></a>, <em class="italic">Azure Sentinel</em>, covers how to use Azure Sentinel to monitor security for your Azure and on-premise resources, including detecting threats before they happen and using artificial intelligence to analyze and investigate threats. Using Azure Sentinel to automate responses to security threats and stop them immediately is also covered.</p>
			<p><a href="B15414_09_Final_JM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor143"><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em></a>, <em class="italic">Security Best Practices</em>, introduces best practices for Azure security, including how to set up a bulletproof Azure environment, finding the hidden security features that are placed all over Azure, and other tools that may help you increase security in Microsoft Azure.</p>
