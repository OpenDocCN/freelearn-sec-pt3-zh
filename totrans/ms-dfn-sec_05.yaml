    they change all your mechanisms to restore your account easily, so while you can

    access to it until the issue has been resolved, which could be hours or even days.
    Attackers know that many companies will not take the risk of leaving their social
    accounts under the control of the attackers (because of the damage to the brand,
    customers and followers), so here is where the attackers demand some payment (normally
    bitcoins) to give the account back to your company.
