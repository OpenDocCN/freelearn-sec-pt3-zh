- en: Today, information technology is a part of almost everything that surrounds
    us. These are the systems that we wear and that support us in building and running
    cities, companies, our personal online shopping tours, and our friendships. These
    systems are attractive to use—and abuse. Consequently, all criminal fields such
    as theft, fraud, blackmailing, and so on expanded to the IT. Nowadays, this is
    a multi-billion, criminal, global shadow industry.

- en: Can a single person spot traces of criminal or suspicious activity conducted
    by a multi-billion, criminal, global shadow industry? Well, sometimes you can.
    To analyze the modern crime, you do not need magnifying glasses and lifting fingerprints
    off wine bottles. Instead, we will see how to apply your Python skills to get
    a close look at the most promising spots on a file system and take digital fingerprints
    from the traces left behind by hackers.

- en: As authors, we believe in the strength of examples over dusty theory. This is
    why we provide samples for forensic tooling and scripts, which are short enough
    to be understood by the average Python programmer, yet usable tools and building
    blocks for real-world IT forensics.

- en: '[Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. Setting Up the Lab and Introduction to Python
    ctypes"), *Setting Up the Lab and Introduction to Python ctypes*, covers how to
    set up your environment to follow the examples that are provided in this book.
    We will take a look at the various Python modules that support our forensic analyses.
    With ctypes, we provide the means to go beyond Python modules and leverage the
    capabilities of native system libraries.'

    provides you with the digital equivalent of taking fingerprints. Just like in
    the case of classic fingerprints, we will show you how to compare the digital
    fingerprints with a huge registry of the known good and bad samples. This will
    support you in focusing your analysis and providing a proof of forensical soundness.'

    *Using Python for Windows and Linux Forensics*, is the first step on your journey
    to understanding digital evidence. We will provide examples to detect signs of
    compromise on Windows and Linux systems. We will conclude the chapter with an
    example on how to use machine learning algorithms in the forensic analysis.'

    Python for Network Forensics*, is all about capturing and analyzing network traffic.
    With the provided tools, you can search and analyze the network traffic for signs
    of exfiltration or signature of malware communication.'

    *Using Python for Virtualization Forensics*, explains how modern virtualization
    concepts can be used by the attacker and forensic analyst. Consequently, we will
    show how to find traces of malicious behavior on the hypervisor level and utilize
    the virtualization layer as a reliable source of forensic data.'

    Python for Mobile Forensics*, will give you an insight on how to retrieve and
    analyze forensic data from mobile devices. The examples will include analyzing
    Android devices as well as Apple iOS devices.'

    Python for Memory Forensics*, demonstrates how to retrieve memory snapshots and
    analyze these RAM images forensically with Linux and Android. With the help of
    tools such as LiME and Volatility, we will demonstrate how to extract information
    from the system memory.'
