    create a placeholder for them in your documentation, and note that they are not
    currently a relevant threat. In the future, if a previously non-relevant threat

    their likelihood and if your assets are affected by them as a result. Floods cause

    new requirements: crossing international borders with PII is now potentially breaking
    the law. A third party storing your organization''s data in plaintext could be
    catastrophic in the event of an insider threat viewing that information. Running
    your platform on a third-party server that, unbeknownst to you, is unpatched and
    vulnerable to exploits that are readily available on the web? There''s another
    risk to your organization''s success. How can you possibly mitigate this? Isn''t
    it the responsibility of the **cloud service provider** (**CSP**) to update their
    systems or encrypt your data? Not unless they have agreed to such, most likely.
    How can you ensure an organization says what it does and does what it says?'

- en: First of all, you'll be happiest when you have legally binding **Service-Level
    Agreements** (**SLAs**). SLAs are a promise from a third party that they will
    keep their service to a certain standard of availability, confidentiality, and
    integrity, among other things. As an example, often, a cloud IaaS SLA might deem
    that in the event of an outage that causes availability to drop below 99.9% (or
    99.99%, or 99.999%) for the month or year, the third-party will reduce the costs
    to their client. This is sometimes referred to as "three nines," "four nines,"
    and so on. It's a way for your organization to mitigate availability risk by offsetting
    the monetary loss experienced from that loss of availability. In a way, your SLA
    is a legally binding control that you are able to report on and ensure is effective.
    SLAs are negotiable in the sales process and can sometimes go back and forth between
    the client and supplier multiple times, with redlining and pushing back from either
    side before an agreement is made. If you work at a CSP, you might find yourself
    as the information security professional who's responsible for negotiating the
    SLAs on the other side as well.

- en: In addition to SLAs, you could use what is known as a **Vendor Security Assessment
    Questionnaire** (**VSAQ**), which is able to be completed by any current vendors
    or prospective vendors. What these VSAQs do is ask a standard set of questions
    for due diligence purposes and record-keeping. The response to these questionnaires
    should be considered during the procurement phase, with risk as the backbone of
    that analysis. Generally, a VSAQ will go over the security program of the vendor,
    any controls they have put into place for protecting their estate, the training
    and awareness that the employees undertake, and the types of audits (along with
    the audit results) that the vendor regularly undergoes. VSAQs are a way to get
    an account on record from the person in charge of information security at the
    company you're paying to process or store your organization's confidential data,
    business processes, and PII or PHI.

    each and every decision for outsourcing data processing and storage to a third
    party. In the event of a breach at the third party's estate, you want to be able
    to show that you made an informed decision based on the testimony of the third
    party's questionnaire answers. If they don't treat a specific threat the way you
    would like, make a note of it, and potentially even discuss the matter with their
    information security team. You might find out that further improvements are actually
    on the roadmap.

- en: Don't worry about being a pain when discussing SLAs or VSAQs. Any vendor worth
    your time has had to answer similar questions and negotiate similar terms with
    other organizations, and might even have those answers prepared. If you're working
    at a CSP and are responsible for answering these VSAQs yourself, then you would
    be very right in cataloguing your responses to those questionnaires, along with
    creating a VSAQ FAQ. It will save you countless painful hours of repetitive work.
    In previous roles at SaaS vendors, I've had a privacy and security whitepaper
    prepared, which answered every question asked in the VSAQs, with drawings and
    technical details provided, which I would then initially pass to each prospective
    customer for them to look through and fill their own questionnaires out. It was
    very helpful in the months leading up to GDPR's effective "start date," where
    a thousand customers were scrambling to prove due-diligence and due care by crafting
    their own version of a VSAQ and sending it out to all their suppliers.

- en: Google's VSAQ web app (https://opensource.google/projects/vsaq) allows a vendor
    to either complete their answers via the app or load their answers from a file,
    and then submit their responses to standard VSAQ questions. Unfortunately, I haven't
    seen nearly enough vendors or customers using this format. It would save so much
    time to just standardize and create the "gold standard" VSAQ and let us all get
    on with making our organizations more secure. Another type of questionnaire is
    the Cloud Security Alliance **Consensus Assessments Initiative Questionnaire**
    (**CAIQ**), available at https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/artifacts/consensus-assessments-initiative-questionnaire-v3-1/.

- en: Keeping this information in your ISMS is important in the event of a third-party
    breach. As we mentioned previously, you want to be able to show an appropriate
    level of **due care**. If you can show that the risk has been measured and deemed
    acceptable, it could help show that you weren't being negligent. It may seem redundant,
    but regulators and stakeholders will want to know the details that led to a decision,
    because they may have to answer to board members, stakeholders, customers, regulators,
    law enforcement, or governmental entities on the matter.

    New exploits become available, new techniques surface, and systems change constantly.
    As new vulnerabilities are discovered, and as new threats arise, all of the implemented
    structures and controls for reducing information security risk at your organization
    need to get better. It's important to keep up to date with what is happening from
    a threat and vulnerability point of view, as well as ensuring your asset and risk
    registers are up to date.

    that leave you? If the answer is "wide open," then you don''t have a sufficient
    amount of **defense-in-depth**. It''s an important concept to grasp: double-locking.
    Adequate defense-in-depth might not reduce risk, but instead allows for a control
    to fail and you to still have a reduced *residual risk*.'

    lens is highly beneficial to an information security professional. You can improve
    processes and systems to make things more lightweight, faster, automated, effective,
    scalable, accessible, and less expensive with fewer errors. Reducing the costs
    of one control allows you to build more defense-in-depth and reduces complexity,
