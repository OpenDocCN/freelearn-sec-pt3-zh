- en: Let's look at a few other basic terms. How about **information**? Information
    includes data but can also include common knowledge or intellectual property.
    For example, the new company slogan that is written down on a whiteboard after
    a brainstorming session is now "information," which should be protected, even
    if it isn't "data" in terms of it sitting on a hard drive in ones and zeros.

  zh: 让我们看看其他一些基本术语。比如**信息**如何定义？信息包括数据，但也可以包括常识或知识产权。例如，经过头脑风暴会议后写在白板上的新公司口号，现在被视为“信息”，即使它不是“数据”（即以二进制形式存储在硬盘上），它也应该受到保护。
- en: 'That logically brings me to **security**, or *the state of protection*. Information
    has the ability to be secured in various ways, most commonly noted as a triangle
    or "triad" of concepts called the **CIA Triad**. You''ll remember this from other
    InfoSec books and training you have done, but **CIA** stands for **confidentiality**,

  zh: 这逻辑上引出了**安全**，即*保护状态*。信息可以通过多种方式进行保护，最常见的是一个三角形或“三元组”的概念，称为**CIA三元组**。你可能从其他信息安全书籍和培训中见过它，但**CIA**代表**机密性**、**完整性**和**可用性**。它们在信息安全的日常操作中非常重要，这就是为什么它们再次被提到：

    means that those with permission to access the information can access it in a
    timely fashion. The reason the *CIA Triad* is often represented as a triangle

    combined with the *impact* of that *threat* exploiting that *vulnerability*, you
    can measure the level of *risk* associated with that **security event**. Your
    organization faces many risks on a daily basis, and those risks may or may not
    already have **risk scores** and annualized costs associated with them, as determined

    isn't about removing all the risk an organization faces, or adding bureaucracy
    for bureaucracy's sake. Risk management provides transparency and accountability

    you cannot have a *risk* without an **asset**. Your organization has many *assets*:

    mentioned already, which focuses on how to manage information security, or *ISO
    27018*, which focuses on providing a code of practice for cloud privacy, and so
    on. Generally, organizations that comply with the requirements set forth in the
    standard are able to be audited by a third-party certification body, and certifications
    or accreditations can be earned for compliance with the requirements of that standard.

    for example, will show that they hold a **ISO 27001** certification from a certification
    body such as the **British Standards Institute** (**BSI**), Deloitte, or a similar

    regulations can occur on a daily basis, and depending on your organization, this
    could mean that keeping up to date requires a team of people to be distributed
    globally, working full time and translating legal requirements to a singular compliance
    requirements matrix, which is then internally audited by the organization. At

    actions and instructions for how to implement controls that improve your compliance
    posture, and map your existing controls to any new requirements in the evolving
    compliance landscape. Large organizations are continually being exposed to compliance
    risk, which could spell millions of dollars/euros/pounds per year being lost,

    results in order to identify and hold and share the results with the parties required,
    but not extra data that isn't relevant to the investigation. It reduces costs,
    time, and complexity to use eDiscovery tools during these events. If you are aiding

    the capacity, create another one to add them to the server, and then increase
    the redundancy to RAID-1\. Is it the perfect solution? No; it's an incremental
    optimization that reduces the risk of downtime on your server and allows your

    to lift the curtain and find that The Ketchup Company has absolutely no redundancy
    in any of its servers and backups, and now there's a high-priority IT operation
    required to prevent a catastrophic failure? It's going to be somewhere in-between
    those two extremes, most likely… but the investigation and findings lead to a

    Agreements** (**SLAs**). SLAs are a promise from a third party that they will
    keep their service to a certain standard of availability, confidentiality, and
    integrity, among other things. As an example, often, a cloud IaaS SLA might deem
    that in the event of an outage that causes availability to drop below 99.9% (or
    99.99%, or 99.999%) for the month or year, the third-party will reduce the costs
    to their client. This is sometimes referred to as "three nines," "four nines,"
    and so on. It's a way for your organization to mitigate availability risk by offsetting
    the monetary loss experienced from that loss of availability. In a way, your SLA
    is a legally binding control that you are able to report on and ensure is effective.
    SLAs are negotiable in the sales process and can sometimes go back and forth between
    the client and supplier multiple times, with redlining and pushing back from either
    side before an agreement is made. If you work at a CSP, you might find yourself

    for due diligence purposes and record-keeping. The response to these questionnaires
    should be considered during the procurement phase, with risk as the backbone of
    that analysis. Generally, a VSAQ will go over the security program of the vendor,
    any controls they have put into place for protecting their estate, the training
    and awareness that the employees undertake, and the types of audits (along with
    the audit results) that the vendor regularly undergoes. VSAQs are a way to get

    at a CSP and are responsible for answering these VSAQs yourself, then you would
    be very right in cataloguing your responses to those questionnaires, along with
    creating a VSAQ FAQ. It will save you countless painful hours of repetitive work.
    In previous roles at SaaS vendors, I've had a privacy and security whitepaper
    prepared, which answered every question asked in the VSAQs, with drawings and
    technical details provided, which I would then initially pass to each prospective
    customer for them to look through and fill their own questionnaires out. It was
    very helpful in the months leading up to GDPR's effective "start date," where

    seen nearly enough vendors or customers using this format. It would save so much

    acceptable, it could help show that you weren't being negligent. It may seem redundant,

    law enforcement, or governmental entities on the matter.

- en: Another important thing to remember is the ideology of continual improvement.
    New exploits become available, new techniques surface, and systems change constantly.
    As new vulnerabilities are discovered, and as new threats arise, all of the implemented
    structures and controls for reducing information security risk at your organization
    need to get better. It's important to keep up to date with what is happening from
    a threat and vulnerability point of view, as well as ensuring your asset and risk
    registers are up to date.

    that leave you? If the answer is "wide open," then you don''t have a sufficient
    amount of **defense-in-depth**. It''s an important concept to grasp: double-locking.
    Adequate defense-in-depth might not reduce risk, but instead allows for a control
    to fail and you to still have a reduced *residual risk*.'

    lens is highly beneficial to an information security professional. You can improve
    processes and systems to make things more lightweight, faster, automated, effective,
    scalable, accessible, and less expensive with fewer errors. Reducing the costs
    of one control allows you to build more defense-in-depth and reduces complexity,
    which is the enemy of security.

    register, potentially by financial quarters, or halves, or years. It will give
    you a great dataset for the impact you''ve made at your organization, and will
    help you justify that pay rise they''ve been hanging over your head for the past
    year. Make graphics, put them into PowerPoint presentations, and regularly update
    your stakeholders at your organization with the progress, wins, and blockers.
    Depending on your organization, and if you''re sitting in the top information
    security role, you could include the CIO, CTO, CFO, and potentially even CEO in
    these conversations. Also, the legal and HR departments will have an interest
    in the topic of insider threats, legal obligations, and other compliance requirements.
    Don''t waste their time, and make sure to keep things non-technical and high-level,
    catered for C-levels who only care about the bottom line: "How much does this
    cost, and how much does this save?" You can show your program''s return on investment
    by utilizing risk reporting.'

    who are impressed with the findings. Other times, you'll find some people who
    don't really care, and are just there because they have to be. Make sure to give
    all your audience members a reason to care. The CFO is going to care about different
    things than the CTO, but they both have their own reasons for wanting to keep
    the lights on and the money coming in.

    made by information security professionals: risk management and governance structures.
    When I introduced this, I said that it probably didn''t sound like a barnburner,
    full of thrills and excitement, but I''m sure now that you''re reading this summary,
    your view on the matter has changed slightly. I would say that with a bit of practice
    in mastering the basics found in this chapter, my promise to you that you will
    be a highly effective, well-oiled risk management machine in no time will come
    true.'

    which is now a much more achievable task. You have an understanding of various
    core concepts, and we're going to proceed toward leveraging everything we have
    covered in this first chapter to create a more mature ISMS, as well as develop
    your skills further by focusing on effective processes to ensure you can identify
    and protect your organization's assets throughout their life cycle, avoiding some
    common pitfalls that information security professionals often run into.
