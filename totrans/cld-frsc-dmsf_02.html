<h3 id="_idParaDest-15" class="calibre6"><a id="_idTextAnchor014" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/>Introduction to the Cloud</h3>
<p class="calibre3">Cloud computing has been around<a id="_idIndexMarker000" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/> for years – the concept of computing resources being offered to users or customers over the internet. While the concept is not new, it has been offered in various forms and can be deployed in various ways. The benefit of the cloud is that it natively offers scalability, the flexibility of resources (meaning you can choose how powerful resources you need, depending upon computational requirements), and cost-effectiveness, making it easier for organizations to plan for cloud adoption. As a result, organizations are now migrating their critical data and business applications to the cloud, creating new challenges for incident responders when investigating security incidents and data breaches. According to Gartner’s report, 80% of enterprises will be moving to a cloud-only strategy by 2025 and moving away from traditional data centers. Meanwhile, the IDG 2020 Cloud Computing survey indicates that at least 92% of companies are using at least one or more cloud services (for example, Microsoft 365 for emails and so on) for their <span>business operations.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">Incident responders need to understand how the cloud works to effectively investigate security incidents. An incident responder is someone or a team who is primarily responsible for handling a security incident related to an <strong class="bold">Information Technology</strong> (<strong class="bold">IT</strong>) system. Incident responders typically will analyze, investigate, contain, and resolve security incidents. Incident responders have a deep understanding of IT computing concepts and carry a deep understanding of investigative procedures, including <span>digital forensics.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">This chapter on the cloud will provide you with a quick refresher on cloud computing, covering important topics such as the history of cloud computing; the advantages and disadvantages of cloud computing; cloud services and deployment models; and the impact cloud adoption has had on several <span>key industries.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">Cloud evolution<a id="_idIndexMarker001" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/> goes as far back as the 1960s when the <strong class="bold">Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency</strong> (<strong class="bold">DARPA</strong>) tasked MIT with developing a computing environment that could be used by two or more people. In 1969, American psychologist<a id="_idIndexMarker002" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/> and computer scientist J.C.R. Licklider, as part of his research in the <strong class="bold">Advanced Research Project Agency Network</strong> (<strong class="bold">ARPANET</strong>), worked on systems that would allow users to connect and share information from anywhere in <span>the world.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">Fast-forward to the 1990s, during the mainframe age, when computing resources were provided centrally. The dot-com boom paved the way<a id="_idIndexMarker003" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/> for web services to be offered over the internet to consumers (<strong class="bold">Software as a Service</strong> (<strong class="bold">SaaS</strong>)). As cloud computing has become more complex and distributed, so have the challenges of managing security incidents and conducting forensic investigations. The ability to collect and analyze data across different cloud environments and deployment models is essential for organizations to respond quickly and effectively to security incidents. The following diagram illustrates the evolution of the cloud from a centralized<a id="_idIndexMarker004" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/> mainframe model to serverless computing and really highlights the importance of continuously developing your forensic methods when responding to cloud-based <span>security incidents<a id="_idTextAnchor015" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/>.</span></p>

<h1 id="_idParaDest-16" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor016" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/>Advantages and disadvantages of cloud computing</h1>
<p class="calibre3">Every technology comes with its own set of complexities and challenges, and there is always a good and bad side of every technological evolution. Here are some of the advantages and disadvantages of <span>cloud computing.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3"><span>Advantages:</span></p>

<ul class="calibre12">
<li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">Modernization and innovation</strong>: The cloud promotes new innovations. Cloud service providers investing<a id="_idIndexMarker005" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/> in advanced infrastructural features allows researchers<a id="_idIndexMarker006" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/> and enthusiasts to research<a id="_idIndexMarker007" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/> and innovate new solutions, such as <strong class="bold">Artificial Intelligence</strong> (<strong class="bold">AI</strong>), <strong class="bold">Machine Learning</strong> (<strong class="bold">ML</strong>), robotics, and <span>so on.</span></li>
<li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">Scalability</strong>: Clearly, a huge advantage of adopting the cloud for organizations is easier scalability of resources. Storage and computational power can be scaled up or down to suit the needs of the organization, applications, or user demands, and all this without any significant<a id="_idIndexMarker008" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/> hardware or software investments. Cloud scalability is particularly useful for deploying <strong class="bold">endpoint detection and response</strong> (<strong class="bold">EDR</strong>) tools, which can help investigators identify and contain threats and conduct forensics on compromised systems. EDR tools can be resource-intensive, requiring significant computing power and storage capacity to run effectively. With cloud scalability, investigators can quickly allocate additional resources to run EDR (and other forensic) tools on the systems under investigation, allowing them to detect and respond to threats more quickly and efficiently and minimizing <span>business disruption.</span></li>
<li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">Flexibility and reach</strong>: You can turn your cloud computing resources on or off; cloud computing offers the flexibility to enable or disable any services based on user demands. Furthermore, you can make your cloud services available through any device with just an internet connection, increasing your application outreach to remote users. Flexibility allows cloud services to be made available in remote parts of the world without any investment in the hardware or software for hosting your applications. Specifically, this allows forensic investigators to gain access to data from across an IT environment fast and efficiently (most commonly through a centralized cloud console). This is critical in identifying and responding to security incidents for organizations that have an IT infrastructure presence in multiple <span>geographic locations.</span></li>
<li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">Cost savings</strong>: One of the biggest advantages of using the cloud is a significantly higher return on investments and low costs. There are no upfront investments required in procuring and setting up hardware/software. No capital investments are required to rent a space in a data center, or set up your own data center. There are also minimal operating costs – just cloud operating costs that are billed to the organization. Reduced capital costs mean organizations can budget more for deploying additional resources to mitigate security incidents, such as hiring security experts, acquiring specialized security tools, and increasing the capacity of their <span>IT infrastructure.</span></li>
<li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">Disaster recovery</strong>: Another advantage of subscribing to cloud services is disaster recovery and ensuring continuity of service to users. Cloud services are typically replicated, load-balanced, and backed up to ensure continuity of services. Robust disaster recovery policies allow organizations to quickly recover from a security incident, minimize downtime and business disruption, and ensure that there will be backups available for forensic analysis <span>if required.</span></li>
<li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">Data security</strong>: Given that cloud service providers invest in the infrastructure to set up and provision cloud services for users, cloud service providers typically use strict security controls, including encryption and advanced access controls. As the cloud operates on a shared security model, it is important to note that customers<a id="_idIndexMarker009" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/> or enterprises subscribing to the cloud are still responsible for the enablement of encryption, access control configurations, and any other security features offered by the cloud <span>service provider.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="calibre3"><span>Disadvantages:</span></p>

<ul class="calibre12">
<li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">Security and privacy risk</strong>: The fact that cloud providers<a id="_idIndexMarker010" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/> invest heavily in protecting cloud infrastructure, putting organizational or customer information in the cloud poses a risk of data exposure of records if the cloud systems are misconfigured. There are plenty of such examples out there that reflect <span>this concern.</span></li>
<li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">Requirement for an internet connection</strong>: Because cloud resources can be accessed from any part of the world, there is a huge dependency on the internet. Without internet access, you cannot perform any activities on <span>the cloud.</span></li>
<li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">Potential vendor lock-in</strong>: Once organizations sign up with a cloud provider to offer their services to users via cloud infrastructure, organizations are often locked in with the same vendor, making it harder to switch to <span>other providers.</span></li>
<li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">Potential service disruption</strong>: Service providers will often try to provide new features/products to end users, and in doing so, they can inadvertently affect services, which can lead<a id="_idIndexMarker011" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/> to outages and <span>service disruptions.</span></li>
</ul>

<h1 id="_idParaDest-17" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor017" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/>An overview of cloud services</h1>
<p class="calibre3">In today’s world, there<a id="_idIndexMarker012" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/> are many services that are virtualized and can be made available in the cloud. The cloud offers scalability of resources and cost-effectiveness, which have been key to <span>its success.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">Generally, cloud computing is offered in the following <span>service models:</span></p>

<ul class="calibre12">
<li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)</strong>: IaaS provides users with access to virtualized resources<a id="_idIndexMarker013" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/> such as servers, operating<a id="_idIndexMarker014" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/> systems, storage, and networking. With IaaS, users are also allowed to customize their infrastructure. For example, they can enable storage encryption or configure the server to access a particular segment of the cloud network. This setup is typically applied by organizations who have their corporate data in the cloud and want to safeguard it from being generally accessible on the internet. It is also a security best practice to only allow cloud resources to access specific network connections, including corporate networks. In IaaS, users can create, configure, and manage their virtual infrastructure on the cloud provider’s platform, paying only for the resources they use. IaaS provides the highest level of control, as cloud consumers are responsible for securing their operating system, applications, and data—as a result, incident responders will have a larger scope and granular access when responding to security incidents. However, because the cloud provider is responsible for securing the physical cloud infrastructure, incident responders may need to work with the cloud provider if the root<a id="_idIndexMarker015" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/> cause is determined to be related to physical hosts, the physical<a id="_idIndexMarker016" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/> network, or the physical <span>data center.</span></li>
<li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">Platform as a Service (PaaS)</strong>: PaaS provides application developers with a ready-made environment<a id="_idIndexMarker017" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/> to build, deploy, and manage applications <a id="_idIndexMarker018" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/>without having to configure the underlying infrastructure. In PaaS, cloud providers typically package the infrastructure based on the needs and requirements of the applications. Some of the platform configurations will allow developers to use various popular programming languages as well, such as Python, Perl, Go, Ruby, Java, Node.js, and .NET. A PaaS setup typically allows auto-scaling, meaning that, based on the performance demands required for the platform to operate, it can scale and share the load of processing and allow users transparent access to the platform. Some PaaS providers will also provide application monitoring and telemetry to allow developers to troubleshoot and optimize their applications for their customers. PaaS provides a mixed level of control, as the cloud provider manages the operating system, and the cloud consumers are responsible for securing only the applications and data. Incident responders will therefore have to work with the cloud service provider if requesting any evidence at the operating <span>system layer.</span></li>
<li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">SaaS</strong>: SaaS provides users with cloud-hosted<a id="_idIndexMarker019" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/> software applications<a id="_idIndexMarker020" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/> over the internet as a web service. Examples include payroll processing, accounting software, <strong class="bold">Customer Relationship Management</strong> (<strong class="bold">CRM</strong>), and project management. The cloud provider<a id="_idIndexMarker021" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/> manages the infrastructure and software, and users can access the software from any device with an internet connection either through a web browser or a dedicated application – for example, an airline ticketing application that accesses the backend services hosted on the cloud. SaaS provides the lowest level of control for a cloud consumer, and as a result, incident responders will have to work with<a id="_idIndexMarker022" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/> any evidence/artifacts/logging at an application level and work<a id="_idIndexMarker023" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/> with the cloud provider for anything else (the infrastructure, operating system, etc.). The features of SaaS include <span>the following:</span><ul class="calibre17"><li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">Multi-tenancy</strong>: Software services are made available to multiple users, on multiple separate<a id="_idIndexMarker024" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/> cloud tenants (shared infrastructure). Tenant refers to an isolated service<a id="_idIndexMarker025" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/> that is made available specifically for users. With multiple tenants, cloud services are isolated from each other, and one user’s data is not available to others, allowing security and privacy of the data stored within <span>the service.</span></li><li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">Automatic updates</strong>: SaaS providers manage updates or upgrades to their software applications without any intervention from <span>their users.</span></li><li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">Scalability</strong>: SaaS providers can scale and support a large number of users <span>and datasets.</span></li><li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">Pay-as-you-go</strong>: SaaS providers typically provide their services as a subscription model, so customers only pay for the resources or the software services <span>they need.</span></li><li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">Accessible from anywhere</strong>: SaaS services are usually offered as accessible from anywhere in the world. Some SaaS providers will also offer their services from any device as well. SaaS providers may customize their service offerings based on the location of the user accessing or subscribing to <span>the services.</span></li></ul></li>
<li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">Database as a Service (DBaaS)</strong>: DBaaS provides users with access<a id="_idIndexMarker026" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/> to managed database<a id="_idIndexMarker027" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/> services, allowing them to store, manage, and analyze data in the cloud. The cloud provider manages the infrastructure, software, and data backups, providing users with a scalable and secure database solution. For DBaaS, an incident responder's focus would be digital forensics at the database<a id="_idIndexMarker028" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/> level (i.e., database configuration, database logging, etc.), if customers have enabled database<a id="_idIndexMarker029" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/> logging including <span>transaction logging.</span></li>
<li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">Function as a Service (FaaS)</strong>: FaaS provides specific functions to users. It is<a id="_idIndexMarker030" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/> also known as serverless computing, allowing developers<a id="_idIndexMarker031" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/> to execute code without having<a id="_idIndexMarker032" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/> to manage servers or infrastructure. It is a subset of PaaS; users can write and deploy their code on the cloud provider’s platform, paying only for the compute resources used. Examples include chatbots and IoT applications. Some of the serverless features include <span>the following:</span><ul class="calibre17"><li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">Event-driven</strong>: Triggered as a result of a particular event<a id="_idIndexMarker033" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/> and specified by the developer. It can also be configured to trigger when a certain condition is met. This type of setup is usually configured for alerting and notifications, where there is an event that occurs and as a result, users <span>are notified.</span></li><li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">Scalable</strong>: Automatically scale to manage the function workload and computing demands, without any <span>manual intervention.</span></li><li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">Pay-per-use</strong>: You only pay for what you use, for example, you will be billed for the compute resources utilized, or volume-based pricing will be used, rather than a fixed fee for <span>computing resources.</span></li><li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">Stateless</strong>: FaaS services are stateless, and do not retain any context or the state of a user’s request between multiple requests from the same user. They simply respond (execute the function) as requested by <span>the user.</span></li><li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">Short-lived</strong>: Functions are short-lived, meaning they execute the function in a few seconds and exit. You are only billed when the function is executed, as that is when compute resources<a id="_idIndexMarker034" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/> <span>are utilized.</span></li></ul></li>

<h1 id="_idParaDest-18" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor018" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/>Cloud deployment models</h1>
<p class="calibre3">It is important to understand<a id="_idIndexMarker035" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/> that cloud services can be deployed through various means and have forensic implications for investigators. These models are a framework for how these services are hosted and delivered to users. We can typically classify cloud deployment into four different models: public, private, hybrid, and <span>community models:</span></p>

<ul class="calibre12">
<li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">Public cloud</strong>: The most popular option for all users<a id="_idIndexMarker036" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/> and service providers<a id="_idIndexMarker037" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/> is a public cloud model. In this model, service providers can deliver their applications over a commonly used infrastructure. Typically, the public cloud is used for non-critical tasks, or by developers to develop and test their applications on a public cloud tenant. Some of the public cloud offerings could also include services such as file hosting services, file sharing services, and email services. In some cases, public cloud services are offered over multiple cloud service<a id="_idIndexMarker038" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/> providers, for example, a public<a id="_idIndexMarker039" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/> cloud application that is deployed and available to users via <strong class="bold">Amazon Web Services</strong> (<strong class="bold">AWS</strong>) and <strong class="bold">Google Cloud Platform</strong> (<strong class="bold">GCP</strong>), depending on the region from which the web service is accessed. The public cloud is typically cheaper for users and is offered on a pay-as-you-go basis, with the ability to scale up or down when required. From a digital forensic standpoint, performing an investigation on a public cloud domain can be challenging because cloud resources are usually shared, and preserving forensic data may be challenging. It can also happen that sometimes you will not find the relevant artifacts you are looking for as some of the resources are terminated and no longer in use, which cloud providers will begin to reallocate, making it harder to gain insight from a digital forensics point of view. The following diagram illustrates some common use cases of the public cloud. Specifically, the following figure highlights the various applications that can be delivered through the <a id="_idIndexMarker040" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/>public cloud, essentially allowing users access to these applications<a id="_idIndexMarker041" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/> for <a id="_idTextAnchor019" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/>free or for a <span>subscription-based fee.</span></li>
</ul>
<div class="calibre2">

</div>
<p class="img---caption" lang="en-US">Figure 1.2 – An example of the public cloud</p>

<ul class="calibre12">
<li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">Private cloud</strong>: A private cloud is a dedicated setup of cloud <a id="_idIndexMarker042" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/>infrastructure owned and operated by a single organization to host<a id="_idIndexMarker043" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/> their application exclusively, making it available to a single customer. An example would be hosting a machine learning application, virtual desktop infrastructure for an organization, and so on. A private cloud setup can be on-premises or hosted by a third party with specific controls. Private clouds are usually expensive to build and maintain and allow organizations to define more granular security controls based on their application needs. As the private cloud demands that the cloud infrastructure is configured and secured appropriately, from a digital forensic standpoint, forensic artifacts are usually available for investigators’ review. Since it’s a private cloud, cloud resources are not reallocated to other tenants, and, therefore, there are better chances of obtaining the logs/artifacts that are needed for investigation in a private cloud setup. The following diagram illustrates some common use cases<a id="_idIndexMarker044" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/> of a private cloud model. For example, a commercial shopping application, internal systems such as <strong class="bold">Enterprise Resource Planning</strong> (<strong class="bold">ERP</strong>) software, and other systems are hosted on dedicated cloud infrastructure<a id="_idIndexMarker045" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/> that i<a id="_idTextAnchor020" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/>s offered to a limited set <a id="_idIndexMarker046" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/><span>of consumers.</span></li>
</ul>
<div class="calibre2">
<div class="img---figure" id="_idContainer009"><img alt="Figure 1.3 – Private cloud setup" src="../images/00064.jpeg" class="calibre19"/></div>
</div>
<p class="img---caption" lang="en-US">Figure 1.3 – Private cloud setup</p>

<ul class="calibre12">
<li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">Hybrid cloud</strong>: This is a mix of public and private<a id="_idIndexMarker047" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/> cloud infrastructure, where customers or users see the hybrid cloud as a single cloud offering transparently. Hybrid cloud infrastructure is typically used by organizations where they want to offload processing a function or require additional storage during peak times. A hybrid cloud can also be set up by some customers by leveraging on-premises systems and connecting with cloud infrastructure to provide additional services (for example, additional storage, cloud backup, and so on). However, having a hybrid infrastructure across public and private clouds may create challenges for investigators from a digital forensics perspective because of the spread of the data and artifacts between private and public clouds. As a result of the chosen deployment model, blind spots may occur during investigations<a id="_idIndexMarker048" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/> as some of the artifacts may be lost and resources may be reallocated, specifically those that were hosted within the public cloud tenant. The following diagram shows a private cloud infrastructure that hosts internal applications such as ERP software and any other internal applications, while also offering services such as Dropbox or Netflix for general users. These applications are <a id="_idTextAnchor021" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/>backed up in private <span>cloud infrastructure.</span></li>
</ul>
<div class="calibre2">

</div>
<p class="img---caption" lang="en-US">Figure 1.4 – Hybrid cloud deployment model</p>

<ul class="calibre12">
<li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">Community cloud</strong>: Organizations with a shared mission may come together to create a joint cloud<a id="_idIndexMarker049" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/> infrastructure that is made available<a id="_idIndexMarker050" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/> for a specific user community. Typically, the organizations that are part of this community share the cost of hosting the infrastructure in the cloud. This kind of setup is typically operated by universities or not-for-profit organizations that come together for a joint cause. The upside of such deployment is shared cost and responsibility for hosting and making the data available to users. A community cloud can be hosted on-premises, in a private cloud, or in public cloud tenants. Investigating breaches in the community cloud is more challenging for investigators because<a id="_idIndexMarker051" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/> of shared infrastructure and resources. Specifically, for <strong class="bold">Digital Forensics and Incident Response</strong> (<strong class="bold">DFIR</strong>) teams, it is important to ensure that you obtain legal authorizations prior to commencing an investigation into a community cloud infrastructure as multiple parties and multiple levels of datasets are involved. DFIR teams should consider the challenges in reviewing forensic artifacts that may be stored across various locations and servers. <span><em class="italic">Figure 1</em></span><em class="italic">.5</em> illustrates a community cloud and how various organizations with the same mission may share a joint cloud infrastructure. For example, a consortium of banks come together to establish a cloud infrastructure to jointly provide services to end users, and these can be classified as a banking community offering services to the public. Similarly, government agencies<a id="_idIndexMarker052" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/> set up a community cloud<a id="_idIndexMarker053" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/> infrastructure to offer joint ser<a id="_idTextAnchor022" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/>vices in one place to end users <span>and citizens.</span></li>

<h1 id="_idParaDest-19" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor023" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/>Cloud adoption success stories</h1>
<p class="calibre3">Many organizations h1ave adopted<a id="_idIndexMarker054" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/> the cloud as their primary center to provide services to their customers. It is essential to understand how cloud infrastructure and applications differ from traditional on-premises IT environments and how to respond to incidents effectively in the cloud. By studying cloud adoption success stories, security professionals can learn about emerging cloud implementation trends and the associated threats and how to proactively <span>address them.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">The following case studies include some of the many examples of organizations that utilize the cloud for their <span>business needs:</span></p>

<ul class="calibre12">
<li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">A large global entertainment streaming platform</strong>: This large streaming enterprise<a id="_idIndexMarker055" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/> adopted the cloud, specifically <strong class="bold">AWS</strong>, to provide its streaming services<a id="_idIndexMarker056" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/> to end users. As one of the world’s leading streaming providers, with more than 200 million members from 190 countries with more than 125 million hours of viewing, it uses AWS for storage, computation resources, and infrastructure to allow quick scalability and meet peak streaming needs.

It promotes shift-left security, continuous security testing, automation, collaboration, and the use of cloud-native security tools and practices. DevSecOps improves the security and reliability of cloud-based applications and infrastructure by identifying and addressing security issues early on, promoting consistency and reducing errors, and ensuring that security measures are applied consistently across all stages of the development process. Overall, DevSecOps ensures that security is a top priority throughout the entire life cycle of a cloud application, leading to a more secure and reliable cloud <span>computing</span><span><a id="_idIndexMarker067" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/></span><span> environment.</span></li>
<li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">ML</strong>: ML models deployed in the cloud can leverage cloud scalability, automation, and accessibility to enable the development of <a id="_idIndexMarker068" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/>intelligent applications that learn from data and improve over time. ML requires vast amounts of data to train models and make accurate predictions, and cloud computing provides the necessary computing power and storage to process large amounts of data. Cloud-based ML platforms can automate many of the tasks involved in developing ML models, making it easier for developers to build and deploy ML models without requiring significant expertise in data science or <span>machine learning.</span></li>
<li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold">Quantum computing</strong>: Quantum computing requires massive amounts of hardware and building them on a physical bare-metal system is expensive. It is regarded as one of <a id="_idIndexMarker069" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/>the most revolutionary computing products by processing complex problems that are currently infeasible in classical computing. Conducting quantum computing enhances ML, cryptography, and <span>simulation applications.</span></li>
