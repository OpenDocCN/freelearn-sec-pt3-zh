    potential suspect? Are there databases that you can use to find information about
    potential targets of the investigation? Is it possible to conduct a sting operation
    using online resources? These are valid questions, and in most cases, the answer
    to these questions will be yes. When you ask someone to find information about
    an individual, one of the first searches will be conducted via Google. Google
    will give you a lot of information that may or may not be pertinent to the individual
    who is the search’s target. A Google search will provide you with many different
    threads that may need to be followed but can also lead you down a rabbit hole
    that may not provide any helpful information.

    as we speak. Law enforcement is looking for criminal activity, such as adults
    looking to sexually exploit children. Private organizations are vetting potential
    new hires, maybe conducting opposition research on a competitor, and institutes
    of higher learning are researching numbers for the incoming class. I am sure you
    have read about a job offer or an offer to attend a college that has been rescinded
    because they discovered historical online information where the user had posted
    derogatory or inflammatory opinions.

    activity in the digital world? An online investigation is a systematic search
    of the internet to identify, preserve, analyze, and report on information relevant
    to the subject of the investigation. Most of us are familiar with someone being
    fired for something they posted online. It could be an insensitive tweet, a TikTok
    video filmed at work, or a Facebook post that could be considered offensive.

    wanted to respond to demanding customers. Eli stated that no customers were present
    for the filming, no company equipment was damaged, and the filming occurred after
    the store was closed. Starbucks responded and said “Eli” was fired because all

    The employee was fired after several postings advocating violence against protesters
    on her open Facebook account. Complaints were made to the employer about the postings.
    As a result, the bank conducted an internal investigation that included an employee
    interview. After the investigation, the bank terminated the employee for violating
    the bank’s Social Media Policy. The bank felt the posts were “offensive, demonstrated
    poor judgment, showed a lack of respect for others, and encouraged violent behavior.”

    helps support your undercover identity. For example, if your undercover identity
    is supposed to be an elite threat actor with skills using the **command-line interface**
    (**CLI**), but you only interact with other users using the **graphical user interface**
    (**GUI**) of Windows 10, this discrepancy could cause your credibility to be questioned.

    an arrest or proceedings in an administrative or civil environment, the platform
    you use will be treated as evidence. If you do not adequately remove all the data
    relating to your true identity, it is possible that information could be used
    against you. While in a perfect world, the obvious answer is to use only new equipment,
    unfortunately, that is not the reality. When you use previously used equipment
    as your platform, you must reformat and reinstall the operating system and any

    use a **virtual private networking** (**VPN**) connection, which will allow you
    to obfuscate your location. The VPN will also encrypt your traffic from your platform
    to the destination, making it unreadable to anyone attempting to eavesdrop on
    your traffic. There are several free and paid VPN services you can use, along
    with the option of creating your own VPN.

    free and open-source anonymity and privacy technologies, supporting unrestricted
    availability and use, and furthering their scientific and popular understanding.”
    The Tor project maintains the Tor network. The Tor network uses open-source software
    to create an overlay network enabled by volunteers. The Tor network allows users
    to maintain their anonymity by protecting their online activities. If the undercover
    operative uses or accesses the “dark web,” they will have to use the Tor network.

    result, it is now being accepted by more and more organizations. A Bitcoin wallet
    is required to store the user’s Bitcoins. Several vendors provide digital wallets
    for users’ digital currencies. There are many digital currencies to choose from
    that are like Bitcoin. For example, in 2013, Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer released

    official to intercept wire, oral, and electronic communications. Suppose you are

    the state (this is for the United States, your local jurisdiction may have different
    rules and regulations for recording voice communications) is a one-party or a
    two-party consent state. A one-party consent state only requires permission from
    a single party in the communication channel to consent to be recorded; a two-party
    consent state requires the consent of both parties in the communication channel
    to consent to be recorded. There are only 12 two-party consent states in the United
    States. There may be some specific requirements, depending on the state. For example,
    Oregon only requires one party to consent for electronic communications but requires
    two-party consent for in-person communications.

    Just be prepared to have to sort through the search results hoping to get a hit
    on your target. There are search engines that are designed to search for people
    specifically. These people search engines generally allow you to retrieve basic
    information about your subject and then request a fee before providing any in-depth
    results. Below are some of the more common people search engines, and the list
    is not exhaustive. I recommend using multiple people search engines to ensure
    that you get the best available information. When I have used the search engines,
    the accuracy I get has varied from search engine to search engine, but I compile
    all of the results into a single document.

    may be associated with the subject. Remember, it is up to you to validate these

    conducting your reconnaissance. There are times when you may get false positives
    while conducting your reconnaissance on the subject.

    document your efforts? Your ability to record your investigative efforts is as
    critical as the investigative states themselves. You have to document your efforts
    in the results. You must include those results which are positive as well as negative.
    When the online investigator is performing investigative activities, there must
    be documentation. This requirement requires you to either capture your efforts
    retroactively or in real time as it occurs.

    However, the screenshot must focus on the artifact or behavior you capture for
    screen capture to be effective. What I mean is that when a screen capture is taken,
    the capture needs to focus on what is important. For example, capturing a desktop
    with six or seven windows open does not effectively communicate to a third party
    what is pertinent. Both macOS and Windows OS can natively capture what is displayed
    on the screen.

    you have any colleagues around that they know you are recording. It can be very

    Hunchly ([https://www.hunch.ly/](https://www.hunch.ly/)). It is not uncommon for
    an online investigator to start with one tab open on their browser while working
    through the investigation. As the investigator finds additional investigative
    leads, additional tabs are then opened. Soon there are many tabs open from following
    the threads of the investigation. If the investigator did not take appropriate
    notes/documentation, it could be challenging to go back and accurately preserve
    what the investigator has seen. The tool Hunchly helps avoid that dilemma. The
    investigator will have to use a Chrome-based browser and install the Hunchly application.

    the target of your investigation can determine your true identity and you have
    been using your personal online persona, you could put yourself in danger. We
    also looked at the various options that investigators can use to identify a subject
    to conduct background investigations. A person may have no digital footprint,
    but I would find that very unlikely. By using open-source information, you may
    be able to collect that data set without alerting the target. Finally, you will
