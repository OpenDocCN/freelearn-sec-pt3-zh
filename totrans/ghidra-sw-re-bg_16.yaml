    project. There is no doubt that by installing Ghidra, using it, and making your
    own developments, that you are already contributing to the project. But by contributing
    to the community, we bring improvements to the official Ghidra source code repository.

    propose changes, add new code to the project, raise any questions, help others
    when you see fit and, finally, learn from people who share your interests in reverse
    engineering. Participating in an open source project can be an exciting adventure
    and a way to learn and help, all while meeting really interesting people.

    we didn't cover all the GitHub and/or Git software capabilities because this is
    outside the scope of this book. In fact, there are many other ways to contribute,
    such as answering the questions of other users, but these are intuitive and will
    not be discussed here.
