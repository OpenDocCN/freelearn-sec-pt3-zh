          <h1 class="title"><a id="ch06"/>Chapter 6. iOS Logical and Cloud Acquisition</h1>

        </div>

      </div>

    </div>

    <p>In this chapter, we'll refer to logical acquisition in the sense of acquiring and analyzing iTunes backups. Every time an iPhone user syncs their device with a PC (Windows or macOS X), iTunes creates a local copy of all user data stored in the device (unless the user opts for cloud backups, which will be covered in the next chapter). While it is arguable whether automated backups with no user intervention are a good thing or a bad thing, unless a <span class="emphasis"><em>cloud</em></span> option is selected, users end up having backup copies of their device contents on every computer they sync with.</p>

    <p>As a result, the chance of encountering a local copy of an iPhone on the user's PC is not insignificant. By default, iTunes stores offline backups in the following folders on the user's computer:</p>

    <div class="itemizedlist">

      <ul class="itemizedlist">

        <li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>macOS X</strong></span>: <code class="literal">~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup/</code></li>

        <li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Windows XP</strong></span>: <code class="literal">Documents and Settings\(username)\Application Data\Apple Computer\MobileSyncBackup</code></li>

        <li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Windows Vista, Windows 7, 8, and 8.1, Windows 10</strong></span>: <code class="literal">Users\(username)\AppData\Roaming\Apple Computer\MobileSyncBackup</code></li>

      </ul>

    </div>

    <p>While these locations can be changed, having a large set of files stored in one of the above folders is a good indication of a local backup being present.</p>

    <p>Compared to the device itself, local backups contain somewhat less information. However, even that is a lot of data. According to Apple, an offline backup may contain:</p>

    <div class="itemizedlist">

    <p>An iTunes backup is not made as a single file. Instead, Apple produces a large number of randomly named files containing various bits of information. The names of the files are probably not completely random; our guess is that the filenames are hash sums of full paths to those same files when stored inside the device.</p>

    <p>According to unofficial iOS Forensics blog, <span class="emphasis"><em>the filenames produced by the backup through iTunes result from iTunes computing a SHA1 hash value of the file's path and name appended to the iOS domain via a hyphen (that is, iOSDomain-FilePath/FileName)</em></span>.</p>

    <p>Interestingly, these files are in fact SQLite database files. In the case of an unprotected backup, they can be read and analyzed with pretty much any forensic tool supporting the SQLite format.</p>

      <p>Apple offers its users the choice of three different backup methods, allowing to be created, plain and password-protected local backups via iTunes, or making over-the-air iCloud backups. The following table plots major differences between the three types of backups:</p>

      <div class="informaltable">

Only some keychain data can be recovered.</p> </td><td> <p>Keychain recovery unavailable (unless securityd is available) **</p> </td></tr></tbody></table>

      </div>

      <p>* iCloud backups as well as iTunes offline backups saved without a password do not expose keychain information in plain text. Instead, keychain data is encrypted by using a hardware-specific key called securityd.</p>

      <p>** In addition to the regular keychain, the iCloud account also contains a so-called <span class="emphasis"><em>iCloud Keychain</em></span>. iCloud Keychain is maintained independently of backup keychains, and is synchronized automatically between all devices that are configured accordingly, even including Mac desktop PCs and even if cloud backups are disabled. The purpose of iCloud Keychain is keeping and synchronizing online form data, such as logins and passwords to websites between devices. Information contained in iCloud Keychain is maintained independently of regular keychains maintained in cloud backups; however, iCloud Keychain contains a subset of data available in regular keychains. Extracting iCloud Keychain is significantly more difficult compared to extracting the iCloud backup due to forced two-factor authentication involving the use of a trusted device, a special access code that may or may not match the device password, or a recovery key. iCloud Keychain recovery is currently not available with any commercial tools. ElcomSoft made a proof-of-concept tool for internal testing purposes. There will be more on iCloud Keychain in the next chapter.</p>

      <p>The great thing about the securityd key is that it remains constant for the lifetime of the device. This key is what allows iOS users to access all of their past, current, and future iOS keychains restored from the unencrypted backups. Unfortunately, extracting securityd is only possible via physical acquisition. As a result, if all you have is an unencrypted backup, and you don't have access to a physical device matching the compatibility matrix for physical acquisition, you will be unable to access keychain data. If, however, you have extracted the securityd key from the device, you will be able to use it to decrypt all current, as well as all future, backups made with that device.</p>

      <p>You can read more about securityd in the following article:</p>

    </div>

    <p>If all you have is an iTunes backup, understanding your options is essential for a successful investigation.</p>

    <p>When configuring a backup policy, iOS users have a choice between creating non-encrypted and password-protected backups. Here's what Apple has to say:</p>

    <p>In the iTunes <span class="strong"><strong>Summary</strong></span> screen, select <span class="strong"><strong>Encrypt iPhone backup</strong></span> if you want to encrypt the information stored on your computer when iTunes makes a backup. Encrypted backups are indicated by a padlock icon (as visible below in the <span class="strong"><strong>Deleting a Backup</strong></span> section), and a password is required to restore the information to iPhone. You may want to write down the password for your backup and store it in a safe place. If you use a Mac, when you set a password you can select to store the password in the keychain. With iOS 4 and later, you can transfer most of your keychain items to a new device if you encrypt the backup.</p>

    <p> </p>

    <div class="mediaobject">

      <img src="0099.jpeg" alt="Encrypted versus unencrypted iTunes backups"/>

    </div>

    <p> </p>

    <div class="note" title="Note" style="">

      <div class="inner">

        <h3 class="title" id="toc_1"><a id="tip28"/>Tip</h3>

        <p> <span class="strong"><strong>Warning</strong></span></p>

        <p>If you encrypt an iPhone backup in iTunes and then forget your password, you will not be able to restore from the backup and your data will be unrecoverable. If you forget the password, you can continue to do backups and use the device; however, you will not be able to restore the encrypted backup to any device without the password. You do not need to enter the password for your backup each time you back up or sync.</p>

      </div>

    </div>

    <p>If you cannot remember the password and want to start again, you will have to do a full software restore and when prompted by iTunes to select the backup to restore from, choose <span class="strong"><strong>Set up as a new device</strong></span>.</p>

    <p>If you read the earlier paragraphs, you may get a sense that password-protected backups allow extracting more information compared to their non-encrypted counterparts. This is true. In a password-protected backup, the keychain (containing a lot of sensitive information such as mail, passwords, account data, and so on) is encrypted with the same password as the rest of the data. In non-encrypted backups, the keychain is encrypted with a hardware-specific key that cannot be broken from the outside.</p>

    <p>Consequentially, users who protect their backups with a password can have them restored to any Apple device complete with all secured items stored in the keychain. Users who opted for non-protected backups can still restore a backup on any Apple device, but will be unable to restore/access any data stored in the keychain. Apple confirms this impression with the following statement:</p>

    <p> <span class="emphasis"><em>"If you encrypt the backup with iOS 4 and later, the keychain information is transferred to the new device. With an unencrypted backup, the keychain can only be restored to the same iPhone or iPod touch. If you are restoring to a new device with an unencrypted backup, you will need to enter these passwords again."</em></span> </p>

    <p>With Apple pushing more and more stuff into the keychain, protecting backups with a password becomes more convenient for the user than ever, while allowing investigators to access secured information stored in the keychain... if they can break the password.</p>

    </div>

    <p>If you encounter a password-protected backup, you'll need to recover (or break) the original password in order to decrypt its content. There is no way around the password. Apple's backup encryption is pretty strong by today's standards, which makes it easier to attack the original password rather than attacking the binary encryption key. The password can only be recovered via the usual means (brute force and dictionary or hybrid attacks).</p>

    <p>In order to break the password, we'll use in-house Elcomsoft Phone Breaker (formerly Phone Password Breaker). This tool was originally designed to do exactly that: breaking iOS backup passwords. Elcomsoft Phone Breaker will attempt to <span class="emphasis"><em>guess</em></span> the password by performing several kinds of attacks. How much time it will need to recover the password, and whether or not it'll be able to recover the password at all, depends on how strong the original password was. Short, simple passwords (for example, 4-digit PIN) can be broken extremely fast, while long, complex alphanumeric passwords can take forever to recover. Unlike the passcode, Apple backup passwords are used infrequently; therefore, users tend to select longer passwords containing letters, numbers, and special characters.</p>

      <p>How fast exactly can you break the password? Unfortunately, unlike physical acquisition, there is <span class="strong"><strong>no fixed timeframe</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>no guarantee</strong></span> for breaking backup passwords. The following factors affect password recovery speeds:</p>

      <div class="itemizedlist">

        <ul class="itemizedlist">

          <li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The speed of your computer's CPU and its graphics card (the latter is way more important than the former)</li>

          <li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The length and complexity of the password (which is a big unknown)</li>

          <li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Any information you know about the password (for example, user's other passwords and any patterns derived from their password-related habits)</li>

        </div>

      </div>

    </div>

    <p>The urge to have a fast CPU is self-explanatory, but why do we need a fast graphics card? And why do we state that having a fast video card is way more important than having a fast CPU?</p>

    <p>The reason for that is GPU acceleration. Today's video cards are extremely fast. Just consider how much computational power is needed to support modern 3D games in high resolutions and 60 frames-per-second, and you'll realize it takes a lot of processing power.</p>

    <p>Using that power to break passwords can give a significant boost to the speed of recovery. By offloading computation-intensive parts of the process to the massively parallel array of graphical processing units (GPUs) of a typical gaming board costing no more than $200-300, one can increase the speed of recovering iTunes passwords 10 to 20 fold. By using an even faster video card, or by utilizing two or more cards, one can boost speeds 30 to 50 fold compared to using a high-end quad-core CPU. Interestingly, ElcomSoft Phone Breaker can utilize all video cards installed in the system even if no SLI/Cross Fire mode is configured.</p>

    <p>There is no limit to how many video cards can be used.</p>

    <p> </p>

    <p> </p>

    <p>Elcomsoft Phone Breaker includes a smart solution to lengthy attacks. The tool can dramatically increase the speed of attacks by utilizing the sheer computational power of consumer or gaming video cards. The tool uses a patented GPU acceleration algorithm to greatly reduce the time required to recover iPhone/iPad/iPod and BlackBerry backup passwords. The latest generation of ElcomSoft GPU acceleration technology supports unlimited numbers of AMD or NVIDIA boards such as NVIDIA GeForce 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, and 900-series and AMD Radeon HD 5000, 6000, 7000, R7, and R9 series. ElcomSoft GPU acceleration provides true supercomputer performance at consumer prices.</p>

          <div>

            <h2 class="title" id="toc_1"><a id="ch06lvl2sec65"/>Breaking complex passwords</h2>

          </div>

        </div>

      </div>

      <p>It is obvious that long and complex passwords take more time to break. The password breaking tool will have to try more possible combinations to discover a long alphanumeric password compared to breaking a simple 4-digit PIN.</p>

      <p>If a password only contains numbers, the use of each additional character makes the password 10 times stronger, which means that breaking the password takes 10 times longer with every additional number. A password that consists entirely of small Latin characters gets 26 times stronger with each extra letter. If the password contains numbers and both small and capital letters, it gets 62 times stronger with every additional character.</p>

      <p>Briefly, the total number of combinations to try is calculated as follows:</p>

      <p>(number of different characters the password may contain) in a power of (password length)</p>

      <p>For example, a rather simple password that consists of only six characters and contains numbers, small and capital Latin letters has 62<sup>6</sup> = 56,800,235,584 (56+ billion) possible combinations. If you don't have any information about the password and just know the length and the fact that it is alphanumeric, the password recovery tool will try them all until it finds the one that matches (unless a more advanced attack such as a wordlist or dictionary attack is successful).</p>

        <div>

          <h1 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl1sec33"/>Knowing the user helps breaking the password</h1>

      </div>

    </div>

    <p>Some passwords are protected stronger than others. In fact, in our daily life we routinely use passwords that are weakly protected or not protected at all. Instant messenger passwords? Stored in Windows Registry or configuration files in plain text or barely scrambled. Website passwords? Depending on the Web browser, these are extracted instantly or in a matter of seconds. E-mail passwords in popular applications such as Outlook Express, Windows Mail, Windows Live! Mail, or Thunderbird? Displayed instantly with a simple free tool. Older Office documents, third-party office applications, and many other sources may contain passwords that are more easily accessible compared to passwords protecting Apple backups.</p>

    <p>It is a good idea to spend some time extracting the easily recoverable passwords stored elsewhere. Add those passwords to the top of the wordlist file used for a dictionary attack, and in some cases, you won't have to deal with lengthy attacks at all.</p>

    <p>Even if none of the other passwords work on an iTunes backup, you didn't spend time for nothing. Look at those passwords. Do you see a common pattern? If passwords chosen by the user are not completely random, more often than not they'll all follow a common pattern. Maybe one or more commonly used words, a phone number, pet name, football team, or just <span class="emphasis"><em>god</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>sex</em></span>, or <span class="emphasis"><em>topsecret</em></span>. Maybe they all start with one capital letter and end with a number. Maybe they have something else in common that you can use to create a common pattern and use that pattern in Elcomsoft Phone Breaker to reduce the number of possible password combinations and speed up the recovery significantly.</p>

    <p>Elcomsoft Phone Breaker also includes a so-called <span class="emphasis"><em>wordlist</em></span> with the most commonly used passwords used by users speaking English, German, and Russian. There are plenty of other lists with commonly used passwords available on the Internet. It's definitely worth downloading some of those lists, as many users are likely to have one of the passwords that are already there. Finally, special options in the product, which allow you to check variations of the words from the wordlist; we call them <span class="emphasis"><em>smart mutations</em></span>.</p>

    <p>What if the user selects a completely random password for every purpose? Complex random passwords, sometimes generated with special software, are not the best security choice. While it is possible for an ordinary person to memorize one or two passwords like that, it is unlikely that such passwords are ever changed. If more than a handful of random passwords are encountered, there is a good chance they are all written down somewhere. Maybe it's a small sheet of paper, and maybe it's a password manager (password keeper) application, either online or installed on the computer. Breaking a master password to that application reveals all of the other passwords, no matter how long or complex they might be.</p>

      </div>

    </div>

    <p>Enough theory! Let's go ahead and do the acquisition.</p>

    <p>First and foremost: Elcomsoft Phone Breaker should be used offline, on your own computer, and never on the suspect's PC. The tool allows decrypting an encrypted backup that is accessible from the computer where you have Elcomsoft Phone Breaker installed. You can mount a disk image or use a network disk; there will be no performance penalty when breaking the password.</p>

    <div class="section" title="Breaking the password">

          </div>

        </div>

      </div>

      <p>Before accessing information stored in the backup, you'll need to decrypt the data. In order to decrypt the data, you'll require the original plain-text password. If you don't know the password, Elcomsoft Phone Breaker will perform an attack in order to recover it.</p>

      <p>In order to recover the password, you will not need to have the complete backup sitting on your computer. In fact, a single tiny file named <code class="literal">Manifest.plist</code> is all that you need to start breaking the password (if you are working with a BlackBerry backup, please refer to online documentation for more information).</p>

      <p>Elcomsoft Phone Breaker recovers the password by <span class="emphasis"><em>attacking</em></span> the backup. You can specify one or more different attacks, for example, wordlist (known password attack), dictionary, brute force, and so on. A combination of attacks makes up a recovery pipeline.</p>

      <p>To recover the password in Elcomsoft Phone Breaker, do the following:</p>

      <div class="orderedlist">

        <ol class="orderedlist arabic">

          <li class="listitem">Open the <span class="strong"><strong>Password Recovery Wizard</strong></span> page.<p> </p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="0101.jpeg" alt="Breaking the password"/></div><p> </p></li>

    <p>Many customers are using computers running macOS X. Elcomsoft Phone Breaker is native Windows software. For this reason, some users run Elcomsoft Phone Breaker in a virtual machine (Windows box) on their Mac. However, there are certain limitations in this setup. One major disadvantage of running Elcomsoft Phone Breaker in a Windows box in a virtual machine is lack of speed. At the time of writing there are no drivers allowing for proper implementation of GPU acceleration in any virtual machine. As a result, attempting to brute-force passwords in a virtual machine will inevitably lead to a severe drop in performance. If your computer is equipped with a mid-range video card, by running password recovery in a virtual box you'll be making the recovery 20 to 50 times slower compared to running the same tool on a physical computer.</p>

    <p>A workaround exists. You can set up a Windows computer on your network, and connect to that computer remotely from your Mac. Note, however, that using the RDP protocol will cause the same slowdown as using a virtual machine. In order to unleash the full potential of GPU acceleration, we recommend connecting via an alternative interface such as TeamViewer.</p>

    <p>Sometimes, accessing information stored in the user's iPhone is possible remotely, even without accessing the original device. Such access is made possible by the fact that iCloud had more than 250 million users last year; this number is steadily growing.</p>

    <p>Meet iCloud forensics: acquiring user data with no lengthy attacks and no physical access to an iPhone device. With recent developments, you don't even need the user's Apple ID and password to access their cloud data. Sounds too good to be true? Let's see what the catch is.</p>

    <div class="section" title="About Apple iCloud">

      <div class="titlepage">

        <div>

          <div>

            <h2 class="title" id="toc_1"><a id="ch06lvl2sec69"/>About Apple iCloud</h2>

          </div>

        </div>

      </div>

      <p>Apple iCloud is a popular service providing Apple users with 5 GB of free online storage space. This storage can be used to back up the content of Apple devices, and to store additional information such as documents, pictures, and music. Last year, more than 300 million Apple customers were actively using iCloud. The numbers are constantly growing.</p>

      <p>iCloud offers great convenience to its users. If, for example, one loses their iPhone during an overseas trip, one can simply buy a replacement device from a local Apple Store, enter their iCloud credentials and have all of their data restored to the new device completely automatically. The same goes for switching or upgrading devices.</p>

      <p>iCloud backups are completely automatic. However, they only occur if certain conditions are met:</p>

      <div class="itemizedlist">

        <ul class="itemizedlist">

          <li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The user has enabled iCloud backups in their device</li>

          <li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The device is docked or connected to a charger</li>

          <li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">A Wi-Fi connection is present</li>

        </ul>

      </div>

      <p>While iCloud backups are incremental and only sync whatever has changed in the device, restoring a backup takes just one go when initializing a new Apple device. However, with larger amounts of data to be transferred, an expert may want a faster acquisition. With Elcomsoft Phone Breaker, one can selectively download certain types of data in order to be able to begin the investigation sooner.</p>

      <p>More information about Apple iCloud is available from Apple:</p>

      <p>Starting with an intermediary release of iOS 7 (version 7.0.3), iCloud also contains keychain data. iCloud Keychain was added as a feature allowing Apple users to sync their account names and passwords across Apple devices. Data stored in iCloud Keychain syncs automatically between all authorized iOS 7 devices and OS X Mavericks sharing the same Apple ID.</p>

      <p>While iCloud Keychain is not automatically enabled, Apple makes it easy to set it up. When initializing a new iOS 7 (or later) device, or immediately after upgrading iOS to the latest version, users are prompted to enable iCloud Keychain. If they decline the choice, it can still be enabled later at <span class="strong"><strong>Settings</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>iCloud</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>iCloud Keychain</strong></span>.</p>

      <p>As an additional security measure, Apple wants users to set up an iCloud Security Code to protect their most sensitive keychain data. This code can be a 4-digit PIN or a more complex passcode. iCloud Security Code is used to authorize any additional devices to access iCloud Keychain. In addition, this passcode is used when recovering iCloud Keychain if the user upgrades or loses a device.</p>

      <p>iCloud Keychain is protected with mandatory two-factor authentication. At this time, there are no commercially available third-party tools allowing the decryption of iCloud Keychain. Technically, iCloud Keychain can be accessed with a third-party product if one has access to a recovery key or a trusted device. ElcomSoft has a proof-of-concept utility allowing us to do just that; however, it has not made it into a commercial product as of yet.</p>

      <p>Another way of accessing data stored in the iCloud Keychain is enabling iCloud Keychain on the Apple device, synchronizing the device, extracting the data from the local keychain, and decrypting it with Elcomsoft Keychain Explorer. This method requires having an unlocked, trusted iOS device.</p>

      <p>Interestingly, the iCloud Keychain (as well as the local keychain of a recently synced device) contains a backup password as well as an Apple ID and password, which may come in handy if one was accessing iCloud by using the authentication token. A password protecting the backup is stored in the regular keychain, and has the strongest protection class. As a result, this password can only be decrypted via physical acquisition.</p>

      <p>iOS 8 introduced the ability to save information other than device backups into the cloud. Apple named the new service the iCloud Drive. In addition to backups, applications were allowed to store data in the cloud; one notable example of such an application is WhatsApp, which maintains its backups separately from iCloud backups. iCloud Drive is aimed to compete with established cloud storage providers such as Box, Dropbox, Google Drive, and Microsoft OneDrive. Users can store just about any type of file in iCloud Drive, while accessing the data from any Apple device as well as from Windows PCs.</p>

      <p>In order to enable iCloud Drive, Apple users must explicitly upgrade their accounts. While Apple users can upgrade their iCloud account to use iCloud Drive at any time, iOS 8 or later is required to access iCloud Drive from iPhones and iPads. iOS 9 makes a much wider use of iCloud Drive, storing cloud backups in the new system and migrating away from the classic iCloud.</p>

      <p>By February 2016, 76% of Apple users had already upgraded to iOS 9, and have their cloud backups stored in iCloud Drive by default. 17% of devices were still running iOS 8 by the time, meaning that cloud backups were stored in the "normal" iCloud, while app-specific backups and other files could also be kept in iCloud Drive. The rest (7%) did not have access to iCloud Drive by February 2016.</p>

      <p>The new iCloud Drive may be used to store all types of user data, including but not limited to the following:</p>

      <div class="itemizedlist">

        <ul class="itemizedlist">

          <li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">iWork documents (if configured to be stored in the cloud) such as Pages, Numbers, Keynote</li>

          <li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Third-party app data (for example, WhatsApp backups, 1Password password databases, and so on)</li>

          <li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Certain system files that are synced across devices (for example, user dictionaries that may contain words and phrases entered by users that are not part of a common dictionary)</li>

        </ul>

      </div>

      <p>iCloud Drive uses a different protocol compared to Apple iCloud. As a result, all cloud forensic tools require explicit support for iCloud Drive in order to be able to access information stored in the cloud service. At this time, Elcomsoft Phone Breaker remains the only tool fully supporting both iCloud and iCloud Drive.</p>

      <p>iCloud forensics offers experts yet another way of obtaining important evidence. The pros of cloud forensics are obvious: no access to physical device is required, and there is no need (nor possibility) for lengthy password attacks. Potential issues include: you must either know the user's Apple ID and password, or have a recent (non-expired) authentication token obtained from the user's PC.</p>

      <p>With cloud forensics, you only have two options. First, you could use a new (or factory-reset) Apple device to restore the data to, then make a backup of that data. This is a long and complicated process. Alternatively, you can use Elcomsoft Phone Breaker, which is the only cloud forensic tool currently available as Apple does not provide means for downloading iCloud information to a PC. If a user owns more than one device, and those devices are registered with the same Apple ID, their online backups can be seamlessly recovered from iCloud with no extra effort.</p>

    <p>At the time of writing, there is only one tool on the market that can perform the complete over-the-air acquisition of iOS devices, including accounts upgraded to iCloud Drive. Elcomsoft Phone Breaker (previously Elcomsoft Phone Password Breaker) was the first and remains the only third-party forensic tool that can retrieve and decrypt backups stored in iCloud and download files stored in the subject's iCloud Drive with or without the original Apple ID and password. Notably, Apple does not provide means for downloading iCloud information to a PC, so Elcomsoft Phone Breaker remains the only tool available for that purpose.</p>

    <p>In order to be able to access the backup, you will need to supply a valid authentication credential to the Apple iCloud server. Until recently, the only way to authenticate when downloading from the cloud was via login (the user's Apple ID) and password. However, it was recently discovered that under certain conditions, a binary authentication token is created and stored on the user's computer, allowing forensic experts to access information from the cloud without knowing the original login and password.</p>

    <p>Depending on whether you know the original Apple ID and password, if you have access to the actual physical device or information obtained from the user's computer, you may choose one of the several acquisition paths.</p>

    <p>It is natural to expect that one needs the original login credentials (Apple ID and password) to access information stored in the cloud. What happens if you don't know the user's Apple ID and password, but have access to their computer that was used to sync with iCloud (or iCloud Drive)? If this is the case, you may attempt connecting to iCloud using a binary authentication token extracted from the user's computer.</p>

    <p>The use of a binary authentication token provides the ability to bypass the login and password authentication of Apple iCloud. As an added benefit, using an authentication token bypasses any two-factor authentication specified by the user.</p>

    <p> </p>

    <div class="mediaobject">

      <img src="0116.jpeg" alt="Downloading iCloud/iCloud Drive backups - using authentication tokens"/>

    </div>

    <p> </p>

    <p>Technically speaking, authentication tokens are small binary files created by iCloud Control Panel to spare the user from entering their login and password every time they sync with the cloud. The token can be extracted from the user's computer if iCloud Control Panel (or iCloud for Windows) is installed and if the user was logged into the Panel on that computer at the time of token acquisition. If the user logs out of iCloud Control Panel, the token is deleted and invalidated, meaning it can no longer be used to access iCloud data even if carved from the hard disk.</p>

    <div class="note" title="Note" style="">

      <div class="inner">

        <h3 class="title" id="toc_1"><a id="note33"/>Note</h3>

        <p>Authentication tokens do not contain a password to the user's Apple account. They don't contain a hash of the password either. You cannot use an authentication token to brute-force the original plain-text password.</p>

      </div>

    </div>

    <p>The iCloud Control Panel is an integral part of macOS systems. Windows systems can use iCloud for Windows. For convenience, users stay logged in to their iCloud Control Panel for seamlessly syncing contacts, passwords (iCloud Keychain), photos, and other types of data. This means it is highly likely to be able to obtain authentication tokens from computers where iCloud Control Panel (iCloud for Windows) is installed.</p>

    <p>Downloading an iCloud backup using an authentication token works similarly to using an Apple ID and password, except that you will need to supply an authentication token instead of the user's Apple ID and password on the following screen:</p>

      <img src="0117.jpeg" alt="Downloading iCloud/iCloud Drive backups - using authentication tokens"/>

    </div>

    <p> </p>

    <p>Please note that you will need to copy the complete authentication token string from the text file extracted with the appropriate command-line tool. In the following screenshot, the entire second line of the text file represents the authentication token:</p>

    <p>Elcomsoft Phone Breaker offers two different methods for extracting tokens. When extracting a binary authentication token from the currently logged in user on a live system, investigators can use the supplied command-line tool (<code class="literal">atex.exe</code>). In all other cases, Elcomsoft Phone Breaker offers a convenient user interface.</p>

    <p>The authentication token must be extracted from the user's computer, hard drive, or forensic disk image before it can be used. Elcomsoft Phone Breaker comes with tools allowing locating, extracting, and decrypting of binary authentication tokens. The tools can extract authentication tokens for all users of that computer including domain users (providing that their system login passwords are known). In addition, authentication tokens can be extracted offline from the user's hard drive or forensic disk image. Command-line tools are available for both Windows and macOS X.</p>

    <p>Let us see how extracting authentication tokens works in Windows. For instructions on how to extract authentication tokens in macOS X, visit <a class="ulink" href="http://www.elcomsoft.com/help/en/eppb/extracting_authentication_mac.html">http://www.elcomsoft.com/help/en/eppb/extracting_authentication_mac.html</a>.</p>

    <p>The authentication token can be extracted for the current iCloud Control Panel user as well as for all other users in the system providing that the correct account password (or the administrative password) is known. In addition, one can extract authentication tokens from binary files <code class="literal">m</code>, stored on virtual disks or forensic disk images. For the sake of simplicity, let's extract an authentication token for the current user of iCloud Control Panel.</p>

    <p>To extract the authentication token for the current iCloud for Windows user on a Windows PC, do the following:</p>

      <p>So are these binary authentication tokens (ATEX) a silver bullet of iOS forensics? We thought so for a few months after discovering this acquisition method. However, Apple has implemented some changes, making iCloud acquisition via binary authentication tokens a somewhat less attractive proposition.</p>

      <div class="note" title="Note" style="">

        <div class="inner">

          <h3 class="title" id="toc_3"><a id="note35"/>Note</h3>

          <p>Depending on iOS version, ATEX tokens extracted from iCloud Control Panel may have limited usability. While one can still use the token to log in to iCloud and view the list of devices and their corresponding backups, on some rare occasions the token may be only valid for one hour for the purpose of downloading iCloud backups. This applies to iOS 8.x.</p>

        </div>

      </div>

      <p>The validity period of iCloud authentication tokens was severely reduced by Apple in response to the celebrity photos hack. However, as new authentication methods became available (which includes two-step verification, later superseded by two-factor authentication), Apple relaxed the rules again.</p>

      <div class="note" title="Note" style="">

        <div class="inner">

          <h3 class="title" id="toc_4"><a id="note36"/>Note</h3>

          <p>The quick token expiration does <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> apply to the new Apple iCloud Drive. While "classic" iCloud tokens apparently expire after one hour, these same tokens when used to authenticate into iCloud Drive (which is used to extract data including cloud backups from devices running iOS 9 and newer) do not appear to have such a short lifespan. We couldn't determine exactly how long the tokens are valid for this purpose, but the lifespan is certainly much longer than that of the <span class="emphasis"><em>classic</em></span> iCloud.</p>

        </div>

      </div>

      <p>The following table explains what ATEX tokens for the <span class="emphasis"><em>classic</em></span> Apple iCloud (iOS 6 through 8) are good for:</p>

      <p>Since iOS 9, Apple keeps cloud backups in iCloud Drive instead of the <span class="emphasis"><em>classic</em></span> iCloud. iCloud Drive tokens are governed by different rules, and do not appear to have such a short lifespan as iCloud tokens.</p>

      <p>That being said, we were unable to determine the exact validity period of iCloud Drive tokens. It's definitely much longer than that of the "classic" iCloud ATEX tokens, and it's definitely longer than a few days. As a result, cloud extraction of iOS 9 and newer devices has more chances to succeed compared to iOS 8.</p>

      <p>Apple iCloud is not exactly the fastest cloud on the planet. In fact, it can be pretty slow at times. Much slower than the speed the average broadband connections. In reality, this means that downloading of full iCloud backup may take several hours, or even overnight in some cases.</p>

      <p>However, you may not even need the full dataset of iOS devices. The user's call history, messages, browsing data, notes, contacts, social communications, and some other types of data are extremely important for an investigation, yet they take very little space in the phone. Considering the speed of Apple iCloud, you may choose to spend a few minutes downloading some selected types of data before obtaining the full backup.</p>

      <p>If you need some data right away to start your investigation, you may use the <span class="strong"><strong>Download only specific data</strong></span> option available in Elcomsoft Phone Breaker.</p>

      </div>

    </div>

    <p>The world of IT security is constantly changing. Recent security outbreaks made Apple implement additional security measures. These increased security measures include the expansion of two-factor authentication and the delivery of notifications to users when information stored in their cloud account is being accessed from a new device. Two-factor authentication is now available (yet still remains optional) for cloud backups.</p>

    <p>Apple has also announced an additional two-factor authentication method. In addition to existing authentication methods that include a verification code on the trusted device and recovery key, the app-specific password method has been added. However, app-specific passwords have little to do with forensic acquisition as they are not related to either backups or files stored in the cloud.</p>

    <p>The pressure for extra security was so strong that Apple was forced to tighten iCloud security ahead of the iOS 8 release. This put an end to using many third-party tools for accessing the cloud if two-factor authentication was enabled.</p>

    <p>Two-factor authentication (as well as the older two-step verification) is still optional. If enabled, experts can only access cloud data if any of the following is available:</p>

    <div class="itemizedlist">

      <ul class="itemizedlist">

        <li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Security code sent to a trusted device</strong></span> must have access to the trusted device or SIM card with a trusted phone number. A trusted device must be unlocked in order to see the security code. A SIM card can be used to receive a verification text message in any device; there is no need to use the original iPhone for that.</li>

        <li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Recovery key</strong></span> created during the time the two-step verification is set.</li>

        <li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Binary authentication token</strong></span> obtained from one of the trusted devices or extracted from a computer</li>

      </ul>

      </div>

      <p>As of today (May 2016), Apple does not enforce two-factor authentication on its customers. Enforcing the extra authentication takes its toll on the ease of use and convenience Apple users are accustomed to. The extra authentication step could lead some users to abandon the idea of cloud backups. As a result, Apple still tries to find a balance by trial and error.</p>

      <p>Apple does not disclose the number of users who have two-factor authentication enabled. Two-factor authentication and two-step authentication are still not completely transparent. In the real world, we don't see many Apple users enabling two-factor authentication. We expect the two-factor authentication acceptance rate to grow slowly but steadily in the foreseeable future.</p>

      </div>

      <p>Two-step verification and two-factor authentication are two distinctly different yet confusingly similar processes aiming to secure access to Apple ID and associated services. Both methods add a secondary authentication factor in addition to the already used Apple ID and password, verifying <span class="emphasis"><em>something you have</em></span> in addition to <span class="emphasis"><em>something you know</em></span>.</p>

      <p>Unlike other companies (for example, Google), Apple does not use a single two-factor authentication solution. Instead, the company had to use two different processes with similar user experience, slightly different names, and completely different technical implementation. What was the reason behind using two different processes? The reality is, <span class="strong"><strong>two-step verification</strong></span> was a rushed afterthought. Apple had to act quickly during the scandal with the celebrity photos leak, implementing tighter security to users of existing (and legacy) versions of iOS. On the other hand, <span class="strong"><strong>two-factor authentication</strong></span> (aren't you already confused?) appeared in iOS 9 and macOS El Capitan, and is available exclusively to users of the latest iOS versions. So what are the differences between the two verification processes, and what is their effect on mobile forensics? Let's try to find out.</p>

      <p> <span class="strong"><strong>Two-step verification</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>2SV</strong></span>) was introduced in 2013 as a rushed response to the iCloud celebrity hack. It was released ahead of iOS 8 to protect access to certain activities with users' Apple ID. 2SV adds an extra verification step when logging in to Apple ID services. The secondary verification step is mandatory when signing into Apple ID or iCloud or making a purchase from a new device (please refer to the earlier Apple links for more information).</p>

      <p>For the purpose of digital forensics, the important part is how Apple delivers codes that serve as the secondary authentication factor.</p>

      <p>There are four different methods in which users can receive codes for two-step verification.</p>

      <p>Unlike two-step verification,which was a rushed afterthought, two-factor authentication (first released in 2015 with iOS 9) is a real technological improvement over the previous scheme. The new and improved security method requires built-in OS support, and only works in iOS 9 and later or OS X El Capitan and later. Importantly, two-factor authentication (2FA) cannot be used with devices running older versions of iOS. Availability of two-factor authentication is currently limited to some regions. 2FA will roll out slowly to all regions.</p>

      <p>Two-factor authentication lost offline recovery keys and app-specific passwords.</p>

      <p> <span class="strong"><strong>Delivering secondary authentication codes</strong></span>:</p>

      <div class="itemizedlist">

        <ul class="itemizedlist">

          <li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Push notification to a trusted device (interactive prompt appears on all trusted devices; device must be unlocked to allow access and to see the code).</li>

          <li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Text message or phone call to a registered number (using the <span class="strong"><strong>Did not get a verification code?</strong></span> link).</li>

          <li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>New</strong></span>: No application-specific passwords. Appending a 6-digit authentication code to the original password can be used to authenticate apps not supporting two-factor authentication.</li>

          <li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>New</strong></span>: Offline authentication via a time-dependent code generated from the settings of a trusted device.</li>

      <p> </p>

      <p>A major advance in two-factor authentication is the ability to generate (and use) authentication codes offline by requesting them from a trusted device.</p>

      <p> </p>

      <div class="mediaobject">

        <img src="0128.jpeg" alt="Two-factor authentication"/>

      </div>

      <p> </p>

      <p>These new offline authentication codes work similar to Google's and Microsoft's implementations. A new code is generated every 30 seconds. There is a difference to Google's and Microsoft's authenticator apps though. Apple uses a unique seed for each trusted device, meaning that each trusted device generates a unique authentication code, while Google and Microsoft only allow maintaining a single seed for all authenticator apps. This means that Apple users can revoke 2FA authorization from each individual device, while Google and Microsoft users revoking 2FA authentication would immediately invalidate all authenticator apps installed on all trusted devices.</p>

      </div>

      <p>There are no more app-specific passwords available to support apps that don't recognize Apple's two-factor authentication scheme. Also gone are Recovery Keys. When accessing a device or service protected with two-factor authentication, users who have at least one device without support for 2FA (such as an iPhone with iOS 8 or older) will see the following prompt:</p>

      <p> <span class="strong"><strong>Some of your devices are not ready for two-factor authentication</strong></span>. If you continue you will have to add a six-digit verification code to the end of your password any time you enter password on an old device</p>

      <p>Apple seems to have made steps making this not as inconvenient as it could be. The first time one attempts making an App Store purchase from an iOS 8.3 device (no 2FA support), one is prompted to enter the password with a 6-digit code appended at the end. A trusted device displays the prompt and the code. Interestingly, in a test we've carried out the next day, the regular Apple ID password worked. To reiterate, we did not have to attach the 6-digit code when we used the same device the next day. However, our trusted device (running iOS 9) still displayed the prompt and the code—yet we didn't have to use it. This is rather confusing.</p>

      <p>What if you don't have access to the secondary authentication factor? No trusted device and no access to a registered phone number.</p>

      <p>In this case, the official path is submitting a request to Apple to regain access to Apple ID with two-factor authentication account recovery <a class="ulink" href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204921">https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204921</a>.</p>

      <p>If you're using Elcomsoft Phone Breaker for cloud acquisition, and if an Apple ID is protected with either 2SV or 2FA, you will need that secondary authentication factor in order to be able to authenticate and access the backups. If two-step verification is enabled on the Apple ID, Elcomsoft Phone Breaker will automatically prompt to enter the secondary authentication code.</p>

      <p>Please note the following:</p>

          <li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">One option to proceed if two-factor authentication is enabled for a given Apple ID is generating (or receiving) a 6-digit authentication code. <span class="emphasis"><em>When authenticating Elcomsoft Phone Breaker, you can append that six-digit code to the end of the password</em></span>.</li>

          <li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">If you're acquiring a backup from an Apple account that uses two-factor authentication (iOS 9 and newer) and you are using an offline 2FA code generated from the trusted device's settings, note that such codes are short-lived.

          <li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">If you don't have access to the secondary authentication factor, you may try using a binary authentication token.

    <p>Acquiring information from an iOS device is one of the first steps. The next step is viewing the data, then discovering and analyzing evidence. There are many excellent forensic tools available for analyzing information extracted from all types of mobile devices. These tools range from extremely simple to large all-in-one packages allowing you to cross-analyze multiple data sources at once.</p>

    <p>If you don't have experience with any of these tools, you may want to start with something light and simple—like, for example, Elcomsoft Phone Viewer.</p>

    <p>Elcomsoft Phone Viewer is a small, lightweight tool one can use to view information extracted from mobile backups. The tool can display contacts, messages, call logs, notes, calendar data, as well as many other types of data. It is also possible to view deleted SMS and iMessages stored in iOS backups.</p>

    <p>In this chapter, we've covered the two most commonly used iOS acquisition methods: logical acquisition and cloud extraction. We discussed backup encryption and password protection and learned about cloud backups and iCloud authentication. We covered the differences between Apple's two-step verification and two-factor authentication, and provided comprehensive step-by-step tutorials covering logical acquisition and cloud extraction. In the next chapter, we'll move from Apple's platform to Microsoft's, and discuss available acquisition options for Windows Phone 8/8.1 and Windows 10 Mobile.</p>
