    or was stored in mobile devices'' memory. The most well-known of them are as follows:'

    in the way they manage the data that is saved in iCloud. That is why, if a device
    owner deleted unwanted information from the device, it can be recovered from the
    iTunes backup, which is stored in iCloud. In the same way, image files and video
    files that were permanently deleted from devices can be recovered from iTunes
    and Android backups.

    different devices running Windows. Therefore, this cloud may contain information
    and documents from the owner's other devices. In other words, if an expert has
    access to this cloud, they have access to almost all the data on the devices of
    the person to whom the account in the cloud belongs.

- en: Due to the fact that a huge volume of confidential data is stored in the cloud
    services, companies (owners of the cloud services) constantly improve the data
    security mechanisms. Two-factor authentication is used almost everywhere, and
    it inhibits access to the data. That is why it is especially important that the
    forensic tools you use for the data extraction from the clouds to support all
    the mechanisms of user authentication in the examined cloud services.

    data extraction from cloud services. The author tested this program and was very
    pleased with its functionality and the ability to extract data from various cloud
    services. However, this program is very expensive and, at the time of writing,
    it was affordable only to military and government organizations. You can get a
    trial version of the program from regional Cellebrite dealers.

    Systemation ([www.msab.com](http://www.msab.com)). However, the author of the
    book did not manage to get a trial or a full version of this program, which is
    why I cannot tell you anything about this product.

    *SIM Cards Acquisition and Analysis*. This program contains the Cloud Extractor
    module, which can be used for data extraction from cloud services. To some extent,
    the interface and functionality of Oxygen Cloud Extractor are similar to UFED
    Cloud Analyzer. However, Oxygen Cloud Extractor is cheaper than UFED Cloud Analyzer
    and it is easier to purchase. In this chapter, the data extraction from Google
    services with the use of Cloud Extractor will be described.

    device. If you extracted the filesystem or made a physical dump of the device,
    it increases the probability of success of the necessary data extraction. Remember
    that user logins and passwords can also work with other cloud service accounts.
    All you need is to test it.

    Despite its modest interface, it has great functionality and extracts the maximum
    amount of data. The peculiarity of Elcomsoft Phone Breaker is that an expert will
    need additional software from the same company to view the extracted data (Elcomsoft
    Phone Viewer), unlike other programs described in this chapter. Elcomsoft Phone
    Breaker is the cheapest of all the programs we have explored for cloud services
    data extraction. In this recipe, we will cover the extraction of iTunes backups
