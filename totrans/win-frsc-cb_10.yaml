- en: The advent of Windows 10 has caused controversy among users and forensic investigators
    alike. Many end users have concerns regarding privacy and security, since the
    privacy settings that are automatically set up on devices with Windows 10 are
    not at all strong. Others have expressed concerns about the way Windows machines
    are now forcing users to migrate to Windows 10, even if they are happy with their
    current versions.

- en: From a forensic perspective, Windows 10 presents a number of new and unique
    challenges. Most of the programs have been modified to look and feel more like
    the applications you would see on a smartphone or tablet, and a lot of them behave
    quite differently from their predecessors. The advent of Cortana has given forensic
    investigators even more data to work with, and the amount of data has also increased
    in line with the interconnected nature of many of the applications.

    just respond to commands. Cortana links in across different devices, giving reminders
    when required and *getting to know* the user. It can recognize an individuals
    voice and handwriting, among other things. For this reason, many Windows users
    have turned the Cortana function off due to privacy concerns - particularly because,
    by default on some machines, Cortana is always on, even when the machine is in
    sleep mode.

    which can be a useful way to demonstrate a users intentions. For example, they
    may have set a reminder to tell them to go to a given location at a set time,
    which may place them near a crime scene. If this is then teamed up with actual
    location data from the `CortanaCoreDb.dat` `LocationTriggers` section, it can
    be either damning or absolving evidence.

    at the path mentioned above. The most relevant data is likely to be contained
    in `CortanaCoreDb.dat`, however there are certain items - such as geolocation
    searches and some dictation records - that may be found in other parts of the

    that is going on around a computer at a given time. This is even the case when
    the computer is locked, which is particularly of interest in forensic investigations.
    Often a computer user - especially with a laptop - will leave their computer on
    but with the screen sleeping for long periods of time, essentially forgetting
    that it is still turned on.

    members of the general public, it can be hugely useful for investigative purposes.
    Snippets of conversations, data about the location of the user, voice searches,
    reminders, and which device a person is using can all be uncovered through the
    methods detailed previously and can provide priceless clues to a persons actions
    and motivations.

    on the cloud and access it from any machine, as long as they are logged in with
    their Microsoft account. Featuring Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, a calendar,
    contacts, and more, this is a straightforward way for users of Microsoft products
    to ensure that they never lose access to their documents. It is also a great source
    of information and data in forensic investigations.

    in instances where a particular device cannot be accessed for one reason or another.
    For example, perhaps a phone has been seized, but it is locked and the passcode
    cannot be retrieved; or perhaps a computer has a password that has proven too
    difficult to bypass. In these instances, if the investigator can gain access to
    a different device owned by the same user, they can often find useful tidbits
    of information in the OneDrive backup files.

    new files, rather than these being saved in My Documents on the local computer,

    modification that takes place in OneDrive for Business. This version of OneDrive
    automatically adds a few lines of code to the beginning of documents when they
    are uploaded. This has strong forensic implications as it means that the original
    MD5 hashes don't match, and can also mean that the files themselves grow slightly
    larger in size. This appears to happen whenever such a file is opened, even if
    no modifications are made - it is part of the automated syncing process. So, if
    you are analyzing a OneDrive for Business file, make sure you account for this
    as part of your process, or you may end up with some sticky questions should the
    case go to court!

    example, we are going to talk about FTK Imager, but the process of extracting
    data and especially elements such as file paths and folder locations, will be
    the same regardless of which tool you prefer to use.

    looking for will be in the `\Users\Username\AppData\Local\Comms` folder.

    are 3 and 7, which refer respectively to mail and attachments. Within these subfolders
    are more subfolders, each ones name corresponding to a letter of the alphabet.
    It is inside these folders that the data we are looking for can be found.

    contents. Simply click on the `.dat` files within the alphabetically-named subfolders
    and you will be able to see a preview of the message within FTK. To view any attachments,
    navigate to folder `7` and go through its alphabetical subfolders. These messages
    and attachments can then be exported into a report for your client.

    folder in `\Users\Username\AppData\Local\Comms`. This data is volatile and frequently
    overwritten, so there may not be anything useful in there. However, on occasion
    you will find fragments of messages from which certain information may be extracted.

    all the contacts to whom a user has sent emails to in the past. You can access
    this data in `\Users\Username\AppData\Local\Comms\UniStoreDB\store.vol\Contact`
  prefs:

- en: The three most interesting elements here are the `Contacts.txt` and `Pcontacts.txt`
    files, which show the names and email addresses of the users contacts. If they
    have stored extra information, such as a contacts address or telephone number,
    this will also be available in plain text within these files.

    is stored in the `\Users\Username\AppData\Local\Comms` folder so that it can be
    easily recalled when the user wants to send a new message. Luckily, this also
    makes it available for forensic investigation!

    games on their Windows 10 machines. At first glance, this may not sound like a
    particularly forensically interesting source of information. However, looking
    under the hood we can find a wealth of data that can be leveraged in investigations.
    This section will take you through how to do that.

    well-known softwares, such as FTK, EnCase and so on, will be able to examine the
    files and their metadata.

    internet later or to refine techniques, or simply to share it with friends. However,
    some people also use this handy built-in feature of the Xbox app to record their
    screens when running various other applications. You can find the recorded gameplay
    data in `\Users\Username\XboxApp\GameDVR\OnThisPC`. Within this folder you should
    see a subfolder called `Videos`, which in turn contains a folder called `Captures`.
    You will then be able to open and play these videos.
