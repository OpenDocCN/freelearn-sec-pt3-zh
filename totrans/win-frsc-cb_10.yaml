- en: The advent of Windows 10 has caused controversy among users and forensic investigators
    alike. Many end users have concerns regarding privacy and security, since the
    privacy settings that are automatically set up on devices with Windows 10 are
    not at all strong. Others have expressed concerns about the way Windows machines
    are now forcing users to migrate to Windows 10, even if they are happy with their
    current versions.

    Windows 机器现在强迫用户迁移到 Windows 10 的方式的担忧，即使他们对当前版本感到满意。
- en: From a forensic perspective, Windows 10 presents a number of new and unique
    challenges. Most of the programs have been modified to look and feel more like
    the applications you would see on a smartphone or tablet, and a lot of them behave
    quite differently from their predecessors. The advent of Cortana has given forensic
    investigators even more data to work with, and the amount of data has also increased
    in line with the interconnected nature of many of the applications.

    just respond to commands. Cortana links in across different devices, giving reminders
    when required and *getting to know* the user. It can recognize an individuals
    voice and handwriting, among other things. For this reason, many Windows users
    have turned the Cortana function off due to privacy concerns - particularly because,
    by default on some machines, Cortana is always on, even when the machine is in

    which may place them near a crime scene. If this is then teamed up with actual

    searches and some dictation records - that may be found in other parts of the

    that is going on around a computer at a given time. This is even the case when
    the computer is locked, which is particularly of interest in forensic investigations.
    Often a computer user - especially with a laptop - will leave their computer on
    but with the screen sleeping for long periods of time, essentially forgetting
    that it is still turned on.

    reminders, and which device a person is using can all be uncovered through the
    methods detailed previously and can provide priceless clues to a persons actions

    on the cloud and access it from any machine, as long as they are logged in with
    their Microsoft account. Featuring Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, a calendar,
    contacts, and more, this is a straightforward way for users of Microsoft products

    in instances where a particular device cannot be accessed for one reason or another.
    For example, perhaps a phone has been seized, but it is locked and the passcode
    cannot be retrieved; or perhaps a computer has a password that has proven too
    difficult to bypass. In these instances, if the investigator can gain access to
    a different device owned by the same user, they can often find useful tidbits
    of information in the OneDrive backup files.

    modification that takes place in OneDrive for Business. This version of OneDrive
    automatically adds a few lines of code to the beginning of documents when they
    are uploaded. This has strong forensic implications as it means that the original
    MD5 hashes don't match, and can also mean that the files themselves grow slightly
    larger in size. This appears to happen whenever such a file is opened, even if
    no modifications are made - it is part of the automated syncing process. So, if
    you are analyzing a OneDrive for Business file, make sure you account for this
    as part of your process, or you may end up with some sticky questions should the
    case go to court!

    and folders within the Dropbox account, as long as they have not been deleted.
    You can find details of how large each file is in `sigstore.db` in the same folder.
    The filecache database is encrypted by default, but this is one of those that
    can be decrypted by Magnet's Dropbox Decryptor, which will allow you to see not
    only the file names but also any associated metadata.

- en: 'The Dropbox Decryptor will also uncover information from the `config.db` file,
    including the email address the account owner used to register, and a list of
    files that have recently been changed. This is particularly of interest in investigations
    where a person may be trying to cover their tracks. In some cases, Dropbox files
    will have been deleted. Deleted files are not kept on the local machine and so
    cannot be accessed strictly through Windows 10 forensic methods. However, if you
    know the username and password for the account, the web-based version of Dropbox
    does keep these files in the cloud. The amount of time for which they are kept
    depends on the type of account: for free accounts, deleted files are kept for
    30 days; for premium (paid) accounts, they are kept forever.'

  zh: Dropbox 解密器还可以从 `config.db` 文件中提取信息，包括账户所有者注册时使用的电子邮件地址，以及最近被更改的文件列表。在一些调查中，这些信息尤其重要，因为可能有人试图掩盖自己的痕迹。在某些情况下，Dropbox
    文件可能已经被删除。已删除的文件不会保存在本地计算机上，因此不能仅通过 Windows 10 的取证方法访问。然而，如果你知道账户的用户名和密码，Dropbox
    的网页版会将这些文件保存在云端。文件保留的时间长短取决于账户类型：免费账户的已删除文件会保留30天；而付费账户的则会永久保留。
