			<h1 id="_idParaDest-183"><em class="italic"><a id="_idTextAnchor228"/>Chapter 13</em>: Contributing to the Ghidra Community</h1>&#13;
			<p><a id="_idTextAnchor229"/>In this chapter, we will address how to officially contribute to the Ghidra project. There is no doubt that by installing Ghidra, using it, and making your own developments, that you are already contributing to the project. But by contributing to the community, we bring improvements to the official Ghidra source code repository.</p>&#13;
			<p>Throughout this chapter, you will learn how to interact with Ghidra's community, propose changes, add new code to the project, raise any questions, help others when you see fit and, finally, learn from people who share your interests in reverse engineering. Participating in an open source project can be an exciting adventure and a way to learn and help, all while meeting really interesting people.</p>&#13;
			<p>We will start by looking at the Ghidra project and its community. This will help you learn about the available official and unofficial resources.</p>&#13;
			<p><a id="_idTextAnchor230"/><a id="_idTextAnchor231"/>Finally, you will explore how to contribute to the Ghidra project in different ways, from reporting a bug in Ghidra to suggesting a <strong class="bold">National Security Agency</strong> (<strong class="bold">NSA</strong>) that you can add your own developed code to.</p>&#13;
			<p>In this chapter, we're going to cover the following topics:  </p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>Overviewing the Ghidra project</li>&#13;
				<li>Exploring contributions</li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>Let's get started!</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-184"><a id="_idTextAnchor232"/>Technical requirements </h1>&#13;
			<p>The following are the technical requirements for this chapter:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>A GitHub account: <a href="https://github.com/join">https://github.com/join</a></li>&#13;
				<li>Git version control system: <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">https://git-scm.com/downloads</a></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>You will also need this book's GitHub repository, which contains all the necessary code for this chapter: <a href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Ghidra-Software-Reverse-Engineering-for-Beginners">https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Ghidra-Software-Reverse-Engineering-for-Beginners</a>.</p>&#13;
			<p>Check out the following link to see the Code in Action video: <a href="https://bit.ly/33OWhNu">https://bit.ly/33OWhNu</a></p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-185"><a id="_idTextAnchor233"/>Overviewing the Ghidra project</h1>&#13;
			<p>The Ghidra <a id="_idIndexMarker478"/>project is available at <a href="https://ghidra-sre.org/">https://ghidra-sre.org/</a>, but, of <a id="_idIndexMarker479"/>course, it is also referenced on the NSA website (<a href="https://www.nsa.gov/resources/everyone/ghidra/">https://www.nsa.gov/resources/everyone/ghidra/</a>). The Ghidra project website allows you to perform the following operations:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>Download the latest release of Ghidra (Ghidra v9.1.2 at the time of writing this book)</li>&#13;
				<li>Check the SHA-256 of the latest release of Ghidra</li>&#13;
				<li>See the released versions of Ghidra</li>&#13;
				<li>View the source code in the Ghidra repository: https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra</li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>The preceding list of operations can be seen in the following screenshot:</p>&#13;

			<p class="figure-caption"> </p>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 13.1 – Download Ghidra</p>&#13;
			<p>Another set of options that the NSA decided to include on their website are as follows:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>The <a id="_idIndexMarker480"/>installation guide: <a href="https://ghidra-sre.org/InstallationGuide.html">https://ghidra-sre.org/InstallationGuide.html</a></li>&#13;
				<li>A cheat <a id="_idIndexMarker481"/>sheet for Ghidra, including hotkeys: <a href="https://ghidra-sre.org/CheatSheet.html">https://ghidra-sre.org/CheatSheet.html</a></li>&#13;
				<li>The wiki for the project, including frequently asked questions: <a href="https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra/wiki">https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra/wiki</a></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>An issue <a id="_idIndexMarker482"/>tracker: <a href="https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra/issues">https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra/issues</a></p>&#13;
			<p>Now that you know about the various resources that are available, let's explore the Ghidra project community.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-186"><a id="_idTextAnchor234"/>The Ghidra community</h2>&#13;
			<p>The Ghidra community is <a id="_idIndexMarker483"/>mainly centralized on GitHub, as we will see in the <em class="italic">Exploring contributions</em> section. The GitHub repository we are referring to here can be found at <a href="https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra">https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra</a>.</p>&#13;
			<p>Apart from this, another <a id="_idIndexMarker484"/>interesting website is the Ghidra Blog: <a href="https://ghidra.re/">https://ghidra.re/</a>. It is not clear who maintains the Ghidra Blog, but it contains many useful resources, some of which are as follows:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>Online Ghidra documentation: <a href="https://ghidra.re/docs/">https://ghidra.re/docs/</a></li>&#13;
				<li>Online Ghidra courses, from beginner to advanced: <a href="https://ghidra.re/online-courses/">https://ghidra.re/online-courses/</a></li>&#13;
				<li>A Twitter account: <a href="https://twitter.com/GHIDRA_RE">https://twitter.com/GHIDRA_RE</a></li>&#13;
				<li>Some Ghidra chat channels for different clients:<p>- Telegram: <a href="https://t.me/GhidraRE/https://t.me/GhidraRE_dev">https://t.me/GhidraRE/https://t.me/GhidraRE_dev</a></p><p>- Matrix: <a href="https://riot.im/app/#/group/+ghidra:matrix.org">https://riot.im/app/#/group/+ghidra:matrix.org</a></p><p>- Discord: <a href="https://discord.gg/S4tQnUB">https://discord.gg/S4tQnUB</a></p></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>I strongly recommend that you join the Telegram channels since they are very active and useful. It is a great way to feel that the community is alive. Have fun while learning!</p>&#13;
			<p>In this section, we looked at all the resources that are available to us in terms of Ghidra. In the <a id="_idIndexMarker485"/>next section, we will focus on Ghidra's GitHub repository, which, as you know, is the core of the Ghidra community. Due to this, it deserves its own section.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-187"><a id="_idTextAnchor235"/>Exploring contributions</h1>&#13;
			<p>In this section, you will look at the different kinds of contributions that can be performed, as well <a id="_idIndexMarker486"/>as the legal aspects of them. Once you've read this section, you will have mastered how to interact with the community and suggest Ghidra code modifications and improvements.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-188"><a id="_idTextAnchor236"/>Understanding legal aspects</h2>&#13;
			<p>Ghidra is distributed under Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004, a permissive license whose main conditions require the preservation of copyright and license notices.As a contributor, you will provide an express grant of patent rights.

			<p class="callout-heading">Collaborators versus Contributors – I</p>&#13;
			<p class="callout">If you want <a id="_idIndexMarker487"/>to learn more about the legal aspects of contributions, please read the license: <a href="https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra/blob/master/LICENSE">https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra/blob/master/LICENSE</a>.</p>&#13;
			<p>Now that you understand the legal aspects of your contributions, let's learn how to submit a bug report.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-189"><a id="_idTextAnchor237"/>Submitting a bug report</h2>&#13;
			<p>One way to <a id="_idIndexMarker488"/>collaborate with Ghidra is to report the bugs you find. Finding a bug is something that can happen even during normal <a id="_idIndexMarker489"/>use of the program. To report a bug, follow this link: </p>&#13;
			<p><a href="https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra/issues">https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra/issues</a>.</p>&#13;
			<p>By following this link, you will be taken to a page that looks similar to the following. Every row in the table corresponds to an issue that's been reported by a Ghidra user. You can report your own bugs by clicking on the <strong class="bold">New issue</strong> button:</p>&#13;
			<p>&#13;
				<div>&#13;
					<img src="img/B16207_13_002.jpg" alt="Figure 13.2 – Ghidra issues reported via GitHub&#13;&#10;"/>&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption"> </p>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 13.2 – Ghidra issues reported via GitHub</p>&#13;
			<p>By doing this, you will reach the <strong class="bold">Get started</strong> option, which allows you to write a report and fill <a id="_idIndexMarker490"/>in a form so that you can describe the bug:</p>&#13;
			<p>&#13;
				<div>&#13;
					<img src="img/B16207_13_003.jpg" alt="Figure 13.3 – Reporting a bug&#13;&#10;"/>&#13;
				</p>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 13.3 – Reporting a bug</p>&#13;
			<p>The self-documented form for an issue looks as follows. Click on <strong class="bold">Submit new issue</strong> once you've filled it in:</p>&#13;
			<p>&#13;
				<div>&#13;
					<img src="img/B16207_13_004.jpg" alt="Figure 13.4 – Reporting a bug&#13;&#10;"/>&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption"> </p>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 13.4 – Reporting a bug</p>&#13;
			<p>Of course, you can <a id="_idIndexMarker491"/>also help people solve issues by clicking on the issue you are interested in. For instance, if we click on the <strong class="bold">Can threads share Application Initialization?</strong> issue shown in <em class="italic">Figure 13.2</em>, we will be able to write a new comment, reply to an existing one, and so on:</p>&#13;

			<p class="figure-caption"> </p>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 13.5 – Writing a comment for a reported issue</p>&#13;
			<p>This issue is currently open, meaning that no solution has been provided for it yet. This fact is highlighted by a green icon stating <strong class="bold">Open</strong>. When an issue has been closed, meaning that <a id="_idIndexMarker492"/>it is already solved, this is highlighted by a red exclamation mark icon, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>&#13;

			<p>There are some privileged roles (collaborators and contributors) that can close your issues if <a id="_idIndexMarker493"/>appropriate. A <strong class="bold">Collaborator</strong> is a community member who contributes changes to the Ghidra project, while a <strong class="bold">Contributor</strong> is a core Ghidra project developer:</p>&#13;

			<p>As you can already see, a lot of aspects of mastering the Ghidra community rely on acquiring <a id="_idIndexMarker497"/>knowledge from GitHub. In the next section, we will learn how to suggest new features.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-190"><a id="_idTextAnchor238"/>Suggesting new features</h2>&#13;
			<p>We can <a id="_idIndexMarker498"/>suggest our own idea to the Ghidra project in the same way we can report a bug; that is, by clicking on <strong class="bold">Issues</strong> | <strong class="bold">New issue</strong>:</p>&#13;

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-191"><a id="_idTextAnchor239"/>Submitting questions</h2>&#13;
			<p>As you <a id="_idIndexMarker501"/>may have noticed, features and bug reports are both considered issues – bug reports, features, and questions are all considered issues, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>&#13;

			<p>If you want to comment on an existing pull request, go to the <strong class="bold">Pull requests</strong> tab in the official Ghidra repository. Here, you can comment on existing pull requests from other users:</p>&#13;

			<p>With that, you have learned how to contribute with your own code to Ghidra. If you want to learn more about how to contribute, check our Ghidra contributing guide.</p>&#13;
			<p class="callout-heading">Contributing guide</p>&#13;
			<p class="callout">If you <a id="_idIndexMarker511"/>want to learn more about how to contribute, check out the following link: <a href="https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md</a>. It is also <a id="_idIndexMarker512"/>recommended that you follow the developer guide if you want to prepare a high-quality development environment: <a href="https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra/blob/master/DevGuide.md">https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra/blob/master/DevGuide.md</a>.</p>&#13;
			<p>This chapter was a detailed guide on how to contribute to Ghidra but, obviously, we didn't cover all the GitHub and/or Git software capabilities because this is outside the scope of <a id="_idIndexMarker513"/>this book. In fact, there are many other ways to contribute, such as answering the questions of other users, but these are intuitive and will not be discussed here.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-193"><a id="_idTextAnchor241"/>Summary</h1>&#13;
			<p>In this chapter, you learned about various Ghidra online resources, including websites, social network accounts, chats, and the Ghidra repository.</p>&#13;
			<p>You also learned how to interact with the community in different ways, including submitting bug reports, new features, questions, and commenting on other user submissions.</p>&#13;
			<p>You then learned that mentioned submissions are, in fact, issues that have different kinds of templates.</p>&#13;
			<p>Finally, you learned how to make a fork of Ghidra, make changes to the code, and propose your modification to the community.</p>&#13;
			<p>In the next chapter, you will learn about some advanced topics that we have not covered yet, such as satisfiability modulo theories and symbolic execution, as well as how to expand your knowledge of what you've learned so far.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-194"><a id="_idTextAnchor242"/>Questions</h1>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li>Do you have to work for NSA in order to participate in the Ghidra development process?</li>&#13;
				<li>How can you interact with other members of the community? How can you chat with them about Ghidra?</li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-195"><a id="_idTextAnchor243"/>Further reading</h1>&#13;
