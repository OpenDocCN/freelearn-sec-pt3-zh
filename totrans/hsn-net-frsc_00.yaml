- en: Network forensics is a subset of digital forensics that deals with network attacks
    and their investigation. In the era of network attacks and malware threats, it's
    now more important than ever to have the skills required to investigate network
    attacks and vulnerabilities.

- en: '*Hands-On Network Forensics* starts with the core concepts within network forensics,
    including coding, networking, forensics tools, and methodologies for forensic
    investigations. You''ll then explore the tools used for network forensics, followed
    by understanding how to apply those tools to a PCAP file and write the accompanying
    report. In addition to this, you will understand how statistical flow analysis,
    network enumeration, tunneling and encryption, and malware detection can be used
    to investigate your network. Toward the end of this book, you will discover how
    network correlation works and how to bring all the information from different
    types of network devices together.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is aimed at incident responders, network engineers, analysts, forensic
    engineers, and network administrators who want to extend their knowledge beyond
    that of a beginner to a level where they understand the science behind network
    protocols and the critical indicators in an incident, and are able to conduct
    a forensic search over the wire.
