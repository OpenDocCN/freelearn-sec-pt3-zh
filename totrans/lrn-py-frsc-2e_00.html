                    <h1 class="header-title">Preface</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="NormalPACKT">At the outset of writing <em>Learning Python for Forensics</em>, we had one goal: to teach the use of Python for forensics in such a way that readers with little to no programming experience could follow along immediately and develop practical code for use in casework. That's not to say that this book is intended for the Python neophyte; throughout, we ease the reader into progressively more challenging code and end by incorporating many of the scripts in previous chapters into a forensic framework. This book makes a few assumptions about the reader's programming experience, and where it does, there will often be a detailed explanation with examples and a list of resources to help bridge the gap in knowledge.</p>
<p class="NormalPACKT">The majority of the book will focus on developing code for various forensic artifacts; however, the first two chapters will teach the basics of the language. This will level the playing field for readers of all skill levels. We intend for the complete Python novice to be able to develop forensically sound and relevant scripts by the end of this book.</p>
<p class="NormalPACKT">Much like in the real world, code development will follow a modular design. Initially, a script might be written one way before rewritten in another to show off the advantages (or disadvantages) of various techniques. Immersing you in this fashion will help build and strengthen the neural links required to retain the process of script design. To allow Python development to become second nature, please retype the exercises shown throughout the chapters for yourself to practice and learn common Python tropes. Never be afraid to modify the code, you will not break anything (except maybe your version of the script) and will have a better understanding of the inner workings of the code as a result.</p>

<p class="NormalPACKT">If you are a forensics student, hobbyist, or professional that is seeking to increase your understanding of forensics through the use of a programming language, then this book is for you.</p>
<p class="NormalPACKT" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt">You are not required to have previous experience of programming to learn and master the content within this book. This material, created by forensic professionals, was written with a unique perspective to help examiners learn programming.</p>

<p class="NormalPACKT"><a href="b09a5e87-9ada-41cb-ba04-bd61c744bf99.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>, <em>Python Fundamentals</em>, is a continuation of the basics learned in the previous chapter and the development of our first forensic script.</p>
<p class="NormalPACKT"><a href="f5b49c85-69ce-4f37-b62d-7f2934e8d30e.xhtml">Chapter 3</a>, <em>Parsing Text Files</em>, discusses a basic setup API log parser to identify first use times for USB devices and introduce the iterative development cycle.</p>

<p class="NormalPACKT"><a href="0a10c29c-1ddf-4ab2-b7fe-44e74117fc8e.xhtml">Chapter 10</a>, <em>Rapidly Triage Systems</em>, shows how you can use Python to collect volatile and other useful information from popular operating systems. This includes an introduction to a very powerful Windows-specific Python API.</p>
<p class="NormalPACKT"><a href="90da6f73-2678-4460-8cfb-b388db40a6c3.xhtml">Chapter 11</a>, <em>Parsing Outlook PST Containers</em>, demonstrates how to read, index, and report on the contents of an Outlook PST container.</p>
