<div><h1 class="header-title">Data recovery overview</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Data recovery is a powerful concept within digital forensics. It is the process of retrieving deleted data from a device or SD card when it cannot be accessed normally. Being able to recover data that has been deleted by a user could help solve civil or criminal cases. This is because many accused just delete data from their device hoping that the evidence will be destroyed. Thus, in most criminal cases, deleted data could be crucial because it may contain information the user wanted to erase from their Android device. For example, consider the scenario where a mobile phone has been seized from a terrorist. Wouldn't it be of the greatest importance to know which items were deleted by them? Access to any deleted SMS messages, pictures, dialed numbers, and so on could be of critical importance as they may reveal a lot of sensitive information.</p>
<p>From a normal user's point of view, recovering data that has been deleted would usually mean referring to the operating system's built-in solutions, such as the Recycle Bin in Windows. While it's true that data can be recovered from these locations, due to an increase in user awareness, these options often don't work. For instance, on a desktop computer, people now use <em>Shift</em> + <em>Del</em> whenever they want to delete a file completely from their desktop. Similarly, in mobile environments, users are aware of the restore operations provided by apps and so on. In spite of these situations, data recovery techniques allow a forensic investigator to access the data that has been deleted from the device.</p>
<p>With respect to Android, it is possible to recover most of the deleted data, including SMS, pictures, application data, and so on. But it is important to seize the device in a proper manner and follow certain procedures, otherwise data might be deleted permanently. To ensure that the deleted data is not lost forever, it is recommended to keep the following points in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not use the phone for any activity after seizing it. The deleted text message exists on the device until the space is needed by some other incoming data, so the phone must not be used for any sort of activity to prevent the data from being overwritten.</li>
<li>Even when the phone is not used, without any intervention from our end, data can be overwritten. For instance, an incoming SMS would automatically occupy the space, which overwrites the deleted data. Also, remote wipe commands can wipe the content present on the device. To prevent such events, you can consider the option of placing the device in a Faraday bag, as explained in <a href="1e7a3a23-96c6-4085-9981-44b579bb2a7f.xhtml" target="_blank"/><a href="1e7a3a23-96c6-4085-9981-44b579bb2a7f.xhtml" target="_blank"/><a href="1e7a3a23-96c6-4085-9981-44b579bb2a7f.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Introducing Android Forensics</em>. Thus, care should be taken to prevent delivery of any new messages or data through any means of communication.</li>
</ul>

<div><h1 class="header-title">How can deleted files be recovered?</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>When a user deletes any data from a device, the data is not actually erased from the device and continues to exist on it. What gets deleted is the pointer to that data. All filesystems contain metadata, which maintains information about the hierarchy of files, filenames, and so on. Deletion will not really erase the data but instead removes the file system metadata. Thus, when text messages or any other files are deleted from a device, they are just made invisible to the user, but the files are still present on the device as long as they are not overwritten by some other data. Hence, there is the possibility of recovering them before new data is added and occupies the space. Deleting the pointer and marking the space as available is an extremely fast operation compared to actually erasing all the data from the device. Hence, to increase performance, operating systems just delete the metadata.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>Recovering deleted data on an Android device involves three scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>Recovering data that is deleted from the SD card such as pictures, videos, and so on</li>
<li>Recovering data that is deleted from SQLite databases such as SMS, chats, web history, and so on</li>
<li>Recovering data that is deleted from the device's internal storage</li>
</ul>
<p>The following sections cover the techniques that can be used to recover deleted data from SD cards, SQLite databases and the internal storage of the Android device.</p>


            

            
        
    </div>



  
<div><h1 class="header-title">Recovering deleted data from SD cards</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Data present on an SD card can reveal lots of information that is useful during a forensic investigation. The fact that pictures, videos, voice recordings, and application data are stored on the SD card adds weight to this. As mentioned in the previous chapters, Android devices often use FAT32 or exFAT file systems on their SD card. The main reason for this is that these file systems are widely supported by most operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and macOS X. The maximum file size on a FAT32 formatted drive is around 4 GB. With increasingly high resolution formats now available, this limit is commonly reached, that's why newer devices support exFAT: this file system doesn't have such limitations. Recovering the data deleted from an external SD is pretty easy if it can be mounted as a drive.</p>
<p class="mce-root">If the SD card is removable, it can be mounted as a drive by connecting it to a computer using a card reader. Any files can be transferred to the SD card while it's mounted. Some of the older devices that use USB mass storage also mount the device to a drive when connected through a USB cable. As explained earlier, in forensics, in order to make sure that the original evidence is not modified, a physical image of the disk is taken and all further experimentation is done on the image itself. Similarly, in the case of SD card analysis, an image of the SD card needs to be taken. The process of imaging is similar to the one explained in <a href="a910938e-1c0b-4f19-baae-509ccaa36c09.xhtml" target="_blank"/><a href="a910938e-1c0b-4f19-baae-509ccaa36c09.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 5</a>, <em>Extracting Data Physically from Android Devices</em>. Once the imaging is done, we have a raw image file. In our example, we will use FTK Imager by AccessData, which is an imaging utility. In addition to creating disk images, it can also be used to explore the contents of a disk image.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root">The following are the steps that can be followed to recover the contents of an SD card using this tool:</p>
<ol>
<li>Start FTK Imager and click on File and then Add Evidence Item... in the menu, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-591 image-border" src="img/dca4bc08-abf6-48a0-88a8-f0293272224e.png" style="width:18.92em;height:18.50em;" width="325" height="316"/></p>
<p>Adding evidence source to FTK Imager</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Select Image File in the Select Source dialog and click on Next.</li>
<li>In the Select File dialog, browse to the location where you downloaded the <kbd>sdcard.dd</kbd> file, select it, and click on Finish, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-592 image-border" src="img/1e797092-a99a-4a5d-9bca-c4ae82616e04.png" style="width:33.92em;height:15.08em;" width="572" height="254"/></p>
<p>Selecting the image file for analysis in FTK Imager</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>FTK Imager's default display will appear with the contents of the SD card visible in the View pane at the lower right. You can also click on the Properties tab below the lower left pane to view the properties for the disk image.</li>
<li>Now, on the left pane, the drive has opened. You can open folders by clicking on the + sign. When highlighting the folder, contents are shown on the right pane. When a file is selected, its contents can be seen on the bottom pane.</li>
<li>As shown in the following screenshot, the deleted files will have a red <kbd>X</kbd> over the icon derived from their file extension:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-593 image-border" src="img/8efa01be-4903-4b30-8e8d-f4a885aa7a75.png" style="width:31.42em;height:23.00em;" width="500" height="366"/></p>
<p>Deleted files shown with red X over the icons</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>As shown in the following screenshot, to export the file, right-click on the file that contains the picture and select Export Files...:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-594 image-border" src="img/ea8ee09c-5c79-4b94-9443-74439cc697fe.png" style="width:28.08em;height:18.58em;" width="513" height="340"/></p>
<p>Sometimes, only a fragment of the file is recoverable, which cannot be read or viewed directly. In that case, we need to look through free or unallocated space for more data. Carving can be used to recover files from free and unallocated space. PhotoRec is one of the tools that can help you to do that. You will learn more about file carving with PhotoRec in the following sections.</p>

<div><h1 class="header-title">Recovering deleted records from SQLite databases</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Most of the application data in Android is stored in SQLite databases. Data related to text messages, emails, and most app data is stored in SQLite databases. Such databases can store deleted data within the database itself. Records marked for deletion by the user no longer appear in the active SQLite database files. Therefore, it is possible to recover the deleted data, such as text messages, contacts, and more, by analyzing these SQLite files. There are two areas within an SQLite page that can contain deleted data: unallocated blocks and free blocks. Most of the commercial forensic tools that recover deleted data scan the unallocated blocks and free blocks of the SQLite pages. Parsing the deleted data can be done using, for example, Belkasoft Evidence Center. The trial version of this commercial forensic tool can be downloaded here: <a href="https://belkasoft.com/get">https://belkasoft.com/get</a>.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>For our example, we will recover deleted SMS messages from an Android device. Recovering deleted SMS messages from an Android phone is quite often requested as part of forensic analysis on a device, mainly because it's the most popular form of communication. There are different ways to recover deleted text messages on an Android device. But, with respect to recovery through parsing SQLite files, we need to understand where the messages are being stored on the device. In <a href="b5ab11df-1911-4deb-accd-f92c74650e6d.xhtml" target="_blank"/><a href="b5ab11df-1911-4deb-accd-f92c74650e6d.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 4</a>, <em>Extracting Data Logically from Android Devices</em>, we explained the important locations on the Android device where user data is stored.</p>
<p>Let's examine <kbd>bugle_db</kbd>, an SQLite database that contains SMS messages sent or received using the Android Messages application. This database is located under <kbd>/data/data/com.android.messaging/databases</kbd>. If you have a physical image of the device, you can extract the database using FTK Imager, just like you did with deleted files. If you want to extract it from the device itself, you can use the <kbd>adb pull</kbd> command, for example (the device must be rooted).</p>
<p>The easiest way to find deleted records is to use commercial mobile forensic tools, such as Belkasoft Evidence Center, Cellebrite UFED Physical Analyzer, Oxygen Forensic Detective, and so on, but there are also some open source tools capable of recovering data from unallocated space and free lists. One such tool is the SQLite Deleted Records Parser by Mari DeGrazia. You can download this tool at her GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/mdegrazia/SQLite-Deleted-Records-Parser">https://github.com/mdegrazia/SQLite-Deleted-Records-Parser</a>. </p>
<p>There are three variants of the tool: a Python script, command-line version, and GUI version. For demonstration purposes, we will use the GUI version, as shown in the following example:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-595 image-border" src="img/1064fc1a-b494-4dd8-9bd6-28193b3b9dc8.png" style="width:27.83em;height:19.58em;" width="553" height="389"/></p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>Using the tool is extremely easy, all you need is to choose the source database and the destination file, and click Process. As a result, you'll get a TSV file (if you've chosen Formatted Output) with recovered records, including their source (unallocated space or free block), offset, and length.</p>

<div><h1 class="header-title">SD card security</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>In older versions of Android, simply plugging a phone into a computer would logically mount the SD card and allow an examiner access to its data. In one of the versions of Android (possibly 3.0), this changed, although the exact version could not be found in the various change logs we examined. Newer versions of Android will not automatically allow access to the SD card from a computer if a screen lock is in use, meaning that the screen lock will have to be bypassed in order to gain access to the SD card. The obvious exception to this is that a physical, external SD card can still be removed and analyzed with traditional computer forensic methods.</p>
<p>SD cards can also be encrypted, either through the device's full-disk encryption if it is an internal SD card, or through third-party applications if it is an external SD card. In some cases, activating the full-disk encryption will leave the SD card unencrypted, though this varies by device manufacturer.</p>
<div><p>The full-disk encryption introduced in Android Lollipop also encrypts the SD card.</p>
</div>

<div><h1 class="header-title">Advanced forensic methods</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>In addition to the methods discussed in the previous chapters, there are also more advanced, specialized methods available. The JTAG and chip-off methods are both highly useful tools in many common situations, but require advanced training (and a lot of practice before working on live evidence!). The final advanced method, a cold boot attack to recover encryption keys, is far more theoretical.</p>


            

            
        
    </div>



  
<div><h1 class="header-title">JTAG</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>JTAG, the <strong>Joint Test Action Group</strong> (<strong>JTAG</strong>) is a standard that was developed by the <strong>Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers</strong> (<strong>IEEE</strong>). During the device production process, it is used to communicate with the processor through a specialized interface for testing purposes. Luckily for forensic examiners, it also allows them to communicate directly with the processor and retrieve a full physical image of the flash memory.</p>
<p>To perform a JTAG extraction, the device must be taken apart, down to the circuit board. The circuit board will contain multiple taps (physical contacts on the device circuit board), though they are commonly unlabeled and there are usually far more taps than required for JTAG. To determine the correct taps, an examiner would have to either find a pin-out online (or included with their tool of choice), or use electronic test equipment to determine what each tap is.</p>
<p>The examiner will then have to solder a wire to each tap, or use adapters (sometimes called jigs) that are commercially available, and connect to their JTAG box through a provided adapter:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-588 image-border" src="img/cbe26e2a-79ef-4f73-ba41-b3fe5090160e.png" style="width:32.33em;height:14.33em;" width="528" height="234"/></p>

<p>JTAG may sound complicated (because it is), but it serves many useful purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>It does not require the device to be powered on:
<ul>
<li>Can be successful even if the device is damaged</li>
<li>No RF-shielding concerns</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It does not require root, ADB, or USB debugging:
<ul>
<li>Can be used to bypass device PINs/passwords</li>
<li>Can image the entire flash memory</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Many manufacturers make JTAG tools, and many of the most common ones that are used for mobile forensics can be found at <a href="http://teeltech.com/mobile-device-forensic-software/teel-tech-jtag-box-sets/">http://teeltech.com/mobile-device-forensic-software/teel-tech-jtag-box-sets/</a>. The RIFF box listed on this site is probably the most frequently used for mobile forensics, as it comes with support (including pin-outs) for a wide variety of devices.</p>
<p>JTAG is not always successful, or even possible. Though the interface is almost always on the circuit board, the manufacturer can choose to disable it after the device has been manufactured.</p>

<div><h1 class="header-title">Chip-off</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Chip-off involves heating the device's circuit board until the solder holding the components to the board melts, and then removing the flash memory chip. The memory chip can then be read using commercial tools, resulting in a full physical image. Chip-off techniques, like JTAG, stem from the commercial electronic production process. The process of melting the solder (commonly called reflow or rework) is used to place and remove components from a circuit board, and the readers used to acquire the memory are used to both read and write to memory chips, often in bulk quantities:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-589 image-border" src="img/cbc2282e-7426-4a35-838c-583bf8d2b31c.png" style="width:18.92em;height:18.92em;" width="390" height="390"/></p>
<p>A memory chip being removed from a damaged phone (courtesy of www.binaryintel.com)</p>
<p>Chip-off has the same benefits as JTAG: it does not require the device to be powered on, and can be used to bypass the PIN/password on a locked device. Chip-off is normally considered to be a destructive process. While the memory chip can be replaced on the device, it is a technically demanding process and requires further training. But, as a last resort, chip-off is an excellent alternative for devices that would otherwise be impossible to examine.</p>
<p>Chip-off is significantly more expensive than JTAG, as a specialized rework station and commercial memory reader is required. There are dozens of rework stations available, and they all provide essentially the same functionality. There is also a wide range of memory readers, though we have had great success with this reasonably priced model: <a href="http://www.dataman.com/programmers/universal/dataman-48pro2-super-fast-universal-isp-programmer.html">http://www.dataman.com/programmers/universal/dataman-48pro2-super-fast-universal-isp-programmer.html</a>. A rework station and reader aren't the only costs associated with chip-off; most readers will also require a specific adapter for each model of chip to be read.</p>

<div><h1 class="header-title">Recovering deleted data from internal memory</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Recovering files deleted from Android's internal memory, such as app data and so on, is not as easy as recovering such data from SD cards and SQLite databases, but, of course, it's not impossible. Many commercial forensic tools are capable of recovering deleted data from Android devices, of course, if physical acquisition is possible and the userdata partition isn't encrypted.  But this is not very common for modern devices, especially those running most recent versions of the operating system, such as Oreo and Pie.</p>
<p>Most Android devices, especially modern smartphones and tablets, use the EXT4 file system to organize data in their internal storage. This file system is very common for Linux-based devices. So, if we want to recover deleted data from the device's internal storage, we need a tool capable of recovering deleted files from the EXT4 file system. One such tool is extundelete. The tool is available for downloading here: <a href="http://extundelete.sourceforge.net/">http://extundelete.sourceforge.net/</a>.</p>
<p>To recover the contents of an inode, extundelete searches a file system's journal for an old copy of that inode. Information contained in the inode helps the tool to locate the file within the file system. To recover not only the file's contents, but also its name, extundelete is able to search the deleted entries in a directory to match the inode number of a file to a file name.</p>
<p>To use this tool, you will need a Linux workstation. Most forensic Linux distributions have it already on board. For example, the following is a screenshot from <strong>SIFT Workstation</strong>—a popular digital forensics and incident response Linux distribution created by Rob Lee and his team from the SANS Institute (<a href="https://digital-forensics.sans.org/community/downloads">https://digital-forensics.sans.org/community/downloads</a>):</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-596 image-border" src="img/4e0c1a39-e836-44f9-b5ff-84ae13cdb19b.png" style="width:68.58em;height:44.75em;" width="823" height="537"/></p>
<p>extundelete command-line options</p>
<p>Before you can start the recovery process, you will need to mount a previously imaged userdata partition. In this example, we are going to use an Android device imaged via the chip-off technique—you've already learned about this technique in <a href="a910938e-1c0b-4f19-baae-509ccaa36c09.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 5</a>,<em> Extracting Data Physically from Android Devices.</em></p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>First of all, we need to determine the location of the userdata partition within the image. To do this, we can use <kbd>mmls</kbd> from the <strong>Sleuth Kit</strong>, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-597 image-border" src="img/b9ce9116-91d1-499d-872e-dfe3158901fd.png" style="width:59.42em;height:54.75em;" width="713" height="657"/></p>
<p>Android device partitions</p>
<p>As you can see in the screenshot, the userdata partition is the last one and starts in sector <kbd>9199616</kbd>. To make sure the userdata partition is EXT4 formatted, let's use <kbd>fsstat</kbd>, as shown in the following example:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-598 image-border" src="img/17ad8b59-c03e-4c89-b535-8ea680fbada8.png" style="width:33.58em;height:8.75em;" width="403" height="105"/></p>

<p class="mce-root">All you need now is to mount the userdata partition and run extundelete against it, as shown in the following example:</p>
<pre><strong>extundelete /userdata/partition/mount/point --restore-all</strong></pre>
<p>All recovered files will be saved to a subdirectory of the current directory named <kbd>RECOVERED_FILES</kbd>. If you are interested in recovering files before or after the specified date, you can use the <kbd>--before date</kbd> and <kbd>--after-date</kbd> options. It's important to note that these dates must be in UNIX Epoch format. There are quite a lot of both online and offline tools capable of converting timestamps, for example, you can use <a href="https://www.epochconverter.com/">https://www.epochconverter.com/</a>.</p>
<p>As you can see, this method isn't very easy and fast, but there is a better way: using Autopsy, an open source digital forensic tool already introduced in <a href="615ae74c-4301-46e6-92f2-387637bebd38.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 3</a>, <em>Understanding Data Storage on Android Devices. </em></p>
<p class="mce-root"/>

<p>In the following example, we used a built-in file extension filter to find all the images on the Android device, and found a lot of deleted artifacts:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-599 image-border" src="img/d6b824c9-c88d-43a9-a3fa-2419e81f6628.png" style="width:77.33em;height:42.33em;" width="928" height="508"/></p>
<p>Recovering deleted files from an EXT4 partition with Autopsy</p>
<p>It's not always possible to recover deleted files using the file system journal; this is where file carving comes in.</p>

<p>File carving is an extremely useful method in forensics because it allows for data that has been deleted or hidden to be recovered for analysis. In simple terms, file carving is the process of reassembling files from fragments in the absence of file system metadata. In file carving, specified file types are searched for and extracted across the binary data to create a forensic image of a partition or an entire disk. File carving recovers files from the unallocated space in a drive based merely on file structure and content, without any matching file system metadata.</p>
<div><p>Unallocated space refers to the part of the drive that no longer holds any file information, as pointed by file system structures such as file tables.</p>
</div>
<p>Files can be recovered or reconstructed by scanning the raw bytes of the disk and reassembling them. This can be done by examining the header (the first few bytes) and footer (the last few bytes) of a file.</p>
<p>File-carving methods are categorized based on the underlying technique in use. The <strong>header-footer carving method</strong> relies on recovering the files based on the header and footer information. For instance, the JPEG files start with <kbd>0xffd8</kbd> and end with <kbd>0xffd9</kbd>. The locations of the header and footer are identified and everything between those two endpoints is carved. Similarly, the <strong>file structure carving method</strong> is based on the internal layout of a file to reconstruct the file. But the traditional file carving techniques, such as the ones we've already explained, may not work if the data is fragmented. To overcome this, new techniques such as <strong>smart carving</strong> use the fragmentation characteristics of several popular file systems to recover the data.</p>
<p>Once the phone is imaged, it can be analyzed using tools such as PhotoRec. PhotoRec is a powerful free utility to carve files. This tool analyzes the block database storage, identifies the deleted files, and recovers them. Scalpel is file system-independent and is known to work on various file systems including EXT4, exFAT, FAT32, and more. The following steps explain how to recover files using PhotoRec on a Windows workstation:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download the tool from <a href="https://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk_Download">https://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk_Download</a>. Unpack the archive in the directory of choice.</li>
<li>Open Command Prompt with Administrator privileges and run <kbd>photorec.exe</kbd> with the Android physical image as an argument.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li>Choose the partition you want to carve data from, in our case it's <kbd>USERDATA</kbd>. This is shown in the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-600 image-border" src="img/1ba7d350-bf8c-4f66-b536-34f5a659b6ac.png" style="width:49.75em;height:39.50em;" width="795" height="632"/></p>
<p>Choosing partition in PhotoRec</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>If you want only exact file types to be carved, go to <kbd>File Opt</kbd>. In our case, we were only interested in JPG images, so we chose only one file type, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-601 image-border" src="img/27f56000-4623-4476-801c-caeb2b66b6f9.png" style="width:36.92em;height:34.17em;" width="687" height="635"/></p>
<p>Choosing file types in PhotoRec</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Choose the file system type, in our case it's EXT4, as shown in the following example:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-602 image-border" src="img/93c60332-8d47-45be-8962-754f7eaa0e74.png" style="width:46.67em;height:14.92em;" width="749" height="239"/></p>
<p>Choosing the file system type in PhotoRec</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>Now, you should choose whether the tool should carve only free space or the whole partition. The second option will bring you more data, but it will be mixed with files those are not deleted. These choices can be seen in the following example:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-603 image-border" src="img/6ecc2f53-a46d-4c1c-8296-b1ce3a9dce8c.png" style="width:45.25em;height:16.33em;" width="739" height="266"/></p>
<p>Choosing if all space needs to be analyzed</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>Finally, choose the folder where the recovered files will be stored. You can use arrow keys to do this, and then press <em>C</em>, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-604 image-border" src="img/47ecf76c-c920-45db-b29d-7aa3f6d29306.png" style="width:48.58em;height:15.33em;" width="718" height="227"/></p>
<p>Recovered files will be saved under the subdirectories of the chosen directory named <kbd>recup_dir</kbd>.</p>

<p>Data recovery is the process of retrieving deleted data from the device and thus is a very important concept in forensics. In this chapter, we have seen various techniques to recover deleted data from both the SD card and the internal memory. While recovering the data from a removable SD card is easy, recovering data from internal memory involves a few complications. SQLite file parsing and file carving techniques aid a forensic analyst in recovering the deleted items present in the internal memory of an Android device. </p>
<p>In the next chapter, we will try to understand the forensic perspective and the analysis of Android apps.</p>
