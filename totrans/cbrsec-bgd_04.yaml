    careers in the cybersecurity industry. Unlike a decade ago, organizations today
    no longer rely on network admins or IT admins to take care of the burden of cybersecurity.
    They have been onboarding experts that are knowledgeable in different attacks
    or threats, and improving the security architecture of the organization. This
    chapter looks at the job market so that we can find cybersecurity roles that organizations
    are advertising and the in-demand skills that you can learn to transit to, change
    to, or build your career in cybersecurity.

    identified and fixed before hackers show up. Penetration testers are essentially
    white hackers who compromise or try to compromise systems as requested by the
    owners of these systems. In security careers, penetration testing is growing in
    relevance in the job market. Since organizations cannot be 100% sure that the
    security tools they have already implemented are sufficient enough to protect
    them, they are always looking for people to breach them. A career in penetration
    testing involves the roles of using common reconnaissance or hacking tools such
    as Metasploit or Wireshark to test the security stature of the organization. It
    will also include reviewing the code that has been used to create the systems
    that organizations run their operations on. The only non-exciting task in this
    job, for many that fancy it, is writing lengthy and detailed reports of the vulnerabilities
    found and the fixes required.

    also looking at reducing the financial burden of doing so. Hiring full-time employees
    just to assess the security level of an organization is being viewed as an added
    expense to the organization. Unlike other IT roles such as helpdesk support, some
    cybersecurity roles are not routine and thus can be carried out once or twice
    a month. In addition to this, there is a shortage of talents in cybersecurity.
    Therefore, employees that have these skills are changing workplaces more regularly
    as they are offered better remuneration packages. Therefore, organizations are
    increasingly having to contract third-party experts to assess their threat landscape
    and exposure. Cybersecurity consultancy roles are favorable to beginners as they
    are a way to gain real-world experience that might be required later in permanent
    positions. Cybersecurity consultants are often specialized in specific roles,
    and so anyone pursuing this role should identify a niche they are good at.

    exchange with customers. In addition to this, hackers are becoming more effective
    at infiltrating organizations and stealing data. They have been able to breach
    organizations that are thought to be highly secure. Once data is stolen, only
    encryption can make it unusable. This is why organizations are employing experts
    that can reliably encrypt data, emails, and internet connections. Cryptographers
    provide these services using the most practical encryption algorithms for each
    functionality. Cryptographers commonly have a degree in computer science and an

    today as is a denial of service attack. System security specialists ensure the
    physical security of digital assets in an organization such as servers and work
    stations. They also test the security measures that have been put in place to
    secure them, such as fire detectors, key-card access systems for servers, and
    other measures. These specialists are also called upon to implement security patches
    and test software to ensure that they are secure from initially identified threats.
    They also do independent assessments of the vulnerabilities faced by computers
    and computer systems. They can, therefore, use the common tools that are used
    to identify vulnerabilities in systems. System security specialists also ensure
    that critical systems have redundancies that can be activated during attacks to
    ensure business operations do not come to a standstill. They will work with other
    IT staff to implement continuity and disaster recovery, and mitigation plans.

    Vulnerability assessment is part of the basic definition of the work of any cybersecurity
    personnel. The skill is used to actively seek threats that may exist in computer
    systems and networks. Cybersecurity experts are expected to know how to identify
    vulnerabilities and determine their chances of being exploited. There are several
    tools and techniques that can be used for detecting vulnerabilities. People seeking
    to start careers in this field should learn how to use these tools and how to
    implement some techniques. An example of a tool that can be used for vulnerability
    assessment is Nmap since it can scan networks to identify the connected devices
    and also scan the devices to identify their open ports, which can be exploited.
    However, Nmap uses a command-line interface, and so you have to learn how to issue
    the different scan commands using it. Code review is a common technique for identifying
    vulnerabilities where the expert can tell whether the code that's used in systems
    can fall to attacks. For instance, a cybersecurity professional should be able
    to tell whether the code for a login page can fall to SQL injection or cross-site
    scripting attacks. They can do this by verifying whether all inputs are validated
    before they are processed.

    that can be used to secure the systems that are used, or warn users of the dangers
    they expose themselves to by posting some information. For instance, a cybersecurity
    professional might try to seek sensitive data that users dispose of inappropriately
    by doing dumpster diving. He or she could discover printed copies of email communications,
    passwords that had been written on sticky notes, or lists of usernames on a particular
    system. This sensitive information ends up in dumpsters every day and so it is

    about any findings from attack incidences or scans that have been carried out
    in the organization. You must learn how to correctly and clearly present findings
    to a non-technical audience. It is not a hard skill to learn, but people in this
    profession ought to have it.

    which side of the law each lies. Penetration testers can become malicious hackers.
    For instance, a pen tester contracted by a bank might find out a vulnerability
    that they can exploit to initiate fund transfer without sounding alarms. The temptation
    to misuse this power and knowledge is massive. However, you are expected to have
    restraint regarding how you use your privileged access or powerful tools. Without
    restraint, you will chase short-term benefits of taking advantage of the access
    you are given to carry out cyber attacks and delete the evidence. It will only
    be a matter of time before you are discovered.

    includes building strong systems that can prevent attacks from happening. The
    end goal of cybersecurity should be sustainable solutions that can offer services
    to legitimate users at all times. The security architecture in many systems is
    focused on strong security controls that can prevent or add an additional burden
    to hackers, thus reducing their effectiveness in carrying out attacks. Let's go
    over some of the security architecture skills that cybersecurity experts should
    have.

    every day. Users have to be authenticated into their computers, network, ERPs,
    and apps. These systems and networks have authentication modules which, when tampered
    with, can give access to malicious people. In addition, there are some cases where
    systems could be configured incorrectly, and therefore allow users to have excessive
    rights. Lastly, some settings could allow guest accounts to be used to carry out
    sensitive functions. Part of the cybersecurity role is to ensure that identity
    and access management is done correctly and does not expose the organization to
    more threats. Cybersecurity experts need to have the know-how of several identity
    and access management systems. For instance, many organizations have domain controllers
    that manage computers connected to a certain domain. Cybersecurity experts should
    know how to access domain controllers and carry out some functions, such as adding
    or removing a user's rights.

    should know how to set up firewalls and intrusion detection systems. Ideally,
    they should be able to do the basic setup and maintenance tasks in networks. They
    should be familiar with how the organizational network is laid out, as well and
    be in a position to alter it when necessary.

    They should be hardened to resist hacking attempts so that hackers are highly
    inconvenienced before they can make any significant progress in breaching an organization.
    Hardening can be done in a number of ways, and cybersecurity professionals need
    to be knowledgeable of most of them. This involves applying several layers of
    security to prevent hackers from gaining access.

    keeps and protects sensitive user information. This ERP could be running on a
    local server. For hackers to get into the app, they might take several paths,
    and one of them is by compromising the server. Cybersecurity professionals could
    put in place intrusion prevention systems and firewalls to prevent this from happening.
    Hackers could use the alternative of trying to use brute-force attacks against
    the login interface of the app. Cybersecurity professionals could implement mechanisms
    to prevent multiple login attempts within a short period of time. Finally, hackers
    could try social engineering to try and get the employees that use the ERP system
    to give them passwords. Cybersecurity professionals could implement two-factor
    authentication and train employees about phishing attacks. Effectively, the ERP
    system will have been hardened and is therefore highly unlikely to be hacked.
    The cybersecurity career involves many such functions, and so experts in this
    field are expected to know about the various ways they can harden different systems.

    cybersecurity is full of entry-level positions that organizations are looking
    to fill with beginners in the industry. The industry is also quite favorable for
    experienced professionals in other fields. One of the main reasons why it is hard
    for recruiters to find highly experienced professionals is because they almost
    always get hired immediately when they are in the market. Therefore, it is never
    too late to start your career and join this list of highly sought-after individuals.
    This section helps job seekers determine which skills they should pick up based
    on their current professional skills and experience. The following is a breakdown
    of some skills based on their friendliness and easy entrance into the job market
    for either beginners or experienced professionals.

    and IT operations. It is aimed at ensuring that business units operate as a team
    in the organization, and breaking down the individualistic views of departments
    as independent units in organizations. It aims at allowing departments to run
    collaboratively, and this often involves the integration of some business operations
    and sharing of data. DevOps, however, introduces organizations to more risks since
    the risks in one department are transferred through the whole organization. DevSecOps
    ensures that risks such as vulnerabilities to apps are mitigated during development.
    Therefore, the safety controls to secure enterprise-wide apps are implemented
    during development. DevSecOps aligns mostly with experienced professionals in
    DevOps. Taking the requisite training could improve a professional's career, allowing
    them to get into higher-ranking positions, such as project managers.

    are compliant with all of them. For instance, there is a COPTA act in the US that
    bars organizations from collecting information of users under the age of 13\.
    There are GDPR regulations being passed by the EU governing how organizations
    inform users about the ways they collect, process, share, and store personal data.
    Alongside these are many other regulations. Each comes with a set of consequences
    if not adhered to. The cybersecurity industry has therefore been welcoming to
    auditors that are more conversant with the rules of compliance to ensure that
    organizations are found to be fully compliant with all applicable regulations.
    Regulatory compliance and auditing training is normally focused on existing professionals
    in auditing. It may also appeal to beginners in cybersecurity, provided that they
    have taken a course in auditing.
