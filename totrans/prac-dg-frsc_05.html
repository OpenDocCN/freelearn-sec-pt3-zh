It introduces new forensic processes and tools to assist in more sound recovery of evidence and better use of resources. The chapter introduces the advent of <span class="strong"><strong>disruptive technology</strong></span> that is challenging the established digital forensic response and overreliance on forensic specialists, who are themselves becoming swamped with heavier caseloads and limited ability to process larger and disparate datasets.</p><p>The topics specifically covered in this chapter will look at:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Emerging problems confronting forensic laboratories and practitioners in recovering evidence from increasingly large and widely dispersed datasets</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Processes and forensic tools to assist practitioners to deal more effectively with these challenges</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Empowering non-specialist law enforcement personnel and other stakeholders, such as IT administrators, forensic auditors, and security officers, to become first respondents at a digital crime scene</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">A case study to illustrate the challenges of interrogating large datasets</li></ul></div><div class="section" title="Digital forensics laboratories"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl1sec41"/>Digital forensics laboratories</h1></div></div></div><p>During the past decade, digital<a id="id350" class="indexterm"/> forensic training and education has accelerated in the government and private sectors to meet the growing demand for qualified practitioners. Many of these entrants to the discipline gain employment with forensic laboratories now undertaking digital forensic examinations. More recently, budgetary constraints are affecting many digital forensics laboratories, which have seriously restricted staffing numbers and specialist training. At the same time, the dramatic increase of laboratories' caseloads can have a detrimental effect on the soundness of the work output. Simply put, forensic laboratories are expensive in terms of equipment, personnel, and buildings.</p><p>However, knowledge sharing within the digital forensic community has resulted in significant progress in mapping and creating solutions to assist with forensic analysis. A broad range of digital forensic laboratories, especially those in the law enforcement environment, are <a id="id351" class="indexterm"/>using this shared body of knowledge to develop guidelines to enhance analysis that will lead to the automation and speeding up of otherwise tedious and time-consuming tasks to process larger datasets.</p><p>The recent demise of many businesses in many parts of the world has sometimes involved a degree of dishonesty by managers and employees seeking to exploit a failing business for some form of financial gain. These transgressions involve the theft of business and client assets that require the expertise of forensic auditors to investigate, who in turn require the expertise of practitioners to locate and analyze relevant digital evidence. This has placed an extra burden of increased caseloads on private laboratories, which also require additional staffing by experienced and qualified practitioners.</p><div class="section" title="The purpose of digital forensics laboratories"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec78"/>The purpose of digital forensics laboratories</h2></div></div></div><p>Few organizations have digital forensic capability, and not all government departments have digital forensic laboratories, for they are expensive and require experienced personnel who are not always readily available. It is more common for organizations to integrate digital<a id="id352" class="indexterm"/> forensics as a part of security-incident response programs. Digital forensic examinations can be costly in terms of time and manpower, as are the laboratories that provide these services. Law enforcement agencies, defense and intelligence agencies, larger financial institutions, and international accounting firms, such as Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, Ernst &amp; Young, KPMG, and PricewaterhouseCoopers, have well-established laboratories.</p><p>Smaller organizations may use the services of established private practitioners or forensic personnel from large and medium-sized accounting practices. The cost of hiring forensic experts is always high and no different from defense legal teams seeking an independent review of the digital evidence recovered by the prosecution experts. Regrettably, it is not always affordable for many defendants to hire consultant practitioners, unless they are well funded or receiving some form of legal aid.</p><p>Well-designed and functioning laboratories provide essential support and coordination for practitioners and for the organizations they serve. Such laboratories enhance and raise the standard of forensic examinations to that expected of courts and offer efficiency in processing cases and better management of resources. The design of an effective laboratory will vary among various organizations, but there are some common requirements. Without some formally established forensic body attuned to and compliant with the evidentiary rules of the relevant legal jurisdiction, digital forensic examinations would be poorly coordinated, piecemeal, and ineffectual.</p><p>The following <a id="id353" class="indexterm"/>sections outline the essential components of a digital forensic laboratory and look at the significant challenges they face.</p></div><div class="section" title="Acceptance of, consensus on, and uptake of digital forensics standards"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec79"/>Acceptance of, consensus on, and uptake of digital forensics standards</h2></div></div></div><p>It should be recalled that the<a id="id354" class="indexterm"/> previous strength of DNA evidence was challenged in the OJ Simpson case, which was well funded to <a id="id355" class="indexterm"/>assist the defense team to successfully refute forensic evidence by claiming it was contaminated in the laboratory, resulting in his eventual acquittal of the murder charge:</p><p>

In Australia, the highly publicized disappearance of the young baby Azaria<a id="id356" class="indexterm"/> Chamberlain and her presumed murder at Ayers Rock uncovered sloppy forensic practice and misinterpretation of the evidence, still resonating in Australia to this day:</p><p>
<a class="ulink" href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-06-13/eastley-a-dingo-did-steal-her-baby/4068026">http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-06-13/eastley-a-dingo-did-steal-her-baby/4068026</a>.</p><p>Accurate and valid examination results are critical to ensuring that justice is served well. Faulty and incompetent forensic examinations may well result in a wrongful conviction, or at least an unsafe trial. Consequently, accreditation of digital forensic laboratories sets higher standards, from which the court may have greater confidence in the forensic analysis and handling of exhibits. Although several jurisdictions require the formal accreditation of forensic laboratories, most do not, notwithstanding repeated calls for accreditation as well as forensic practitioner certification. Such calls insist that forensic practitioners require certification that includes proficiency testing that qualifies them to practice and provide expert testimony.</p><p>However, it seems unlikely that any general agreement on such accreditation is going to be accepted in most jurisdictions, and even less likely that any international accreditation agreement will ever be reached. What is more likely is that practitioners will be required to establish their professional credentials with courts and employees to show that they merit acceptance as a professionally qualified practitioner.</p><p>Recall from <a class="link" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. The Nature and Special Properties of Digital Evidence">Chapter 3</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>The Nature and Special Properties of Digital Evidence</em></span>, the use of the Daubert Test to measure the competence of digital forensic tools and the qualifications of forensic practitioners, common in the United States, yet still not adopted in other jurisdictions to any major significance. The United States tends to show the way in testing and validating digital forensic practice, which has been driven to a large extent by case law and legal precedent.</p><p>There is also an<a id="id357" class="indexterm"/> expectation that digital forensics laboratories be accredited to <code class="literal">ISO 17025</code> or the US equivalent <a id="id358" class="indexterm"/>
<span class="strong"><strong>American Society of Crime Laboratory Directors/Laboratory Accreditation Board</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>ASCLD/LAB</strong></span>) international requirements. ASCLD/LAB international accredited laboratories must conform to some 360 standards of <code class="literal">ISO 17025</code> but a significantly lower number for digital forensics laboratories.</p><p>Although the<a id="id359" class="indexterm"/> regulation does not define digital evidence, it requires some guarantees from laboratories as to the:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Appropriate safe custody of physical exhibits</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Validation of the forensic processes and tools used</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Adherence to forensic best practices</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Forensic computers being in effective working order</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Verifiable calibration of forensic tools</li></ul></div><p>Under this regime, evidence preservation and handling and physical security policies and processes must be geared to preserve evidence. The "tagging and bagging" of physical exhibits such as computer and storage devices is addressed clearly but in terms of the definition of digital evidence and a digital evidence container, they are not defined at all. This raises some <a id="id360" class="indexterm"/>concerns as to whether the computer or its hard drive is the actual evidence and the computer case its container. Regrettably, no definition is provided to clarify whether digital data stored on the hard drive or other storage media is the evidence container.</p><p>These may be considered semantic issues, but the lack of clarity has raised challenges as to the nature of digitized copies of the original evidence, such as videotapes generated during examination and exported for court presentation being called <span class="strong"><strong>original evidence</strong></span>. However, legislators and courts have taken a pragmatic approach to digital evidence and consider that any data recording on a computer that may be printed, duplicated, or copied is the best evidence and may be admissible, provided its authenticity is verified.</p><p>The adoption of standards has been driven by the United States and the European Union. Unfortunately, these standards tend to cover only general requirements and are not geared specifically towards digital forensics, leaving digital forensics laboratories resorting to expensive piecemeal efforts to try to meet the expectations of the courts. While ISO 17025 has a sound track record in establishing quality management systems for the more established forensics disciplines, it has shown to be time and resource intensive and ineffective in<a id="id361" class="indexterm"/> digital forensics laboratories. This is because the standard was designed for traditional disciplines. Those implementing<a id="id362" class="indexterm"/> the design <a id="id363" class="indexterm"/>are often traditional forensics managers with limited understanding of digital forensics and best practices.</p></div><div class="section" title="Best practices for digital forensics laboratories"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec80"/>Best practices for digital forensics laboratories</h2></div></div></div><p>Best practice manuals, regulations, and governance are an essential part of any forensic laboratory, ensuring that <a id="id364" class="indexterm"/>case management runs as smoothly and professionally as possible. Best practice includes the management of examinations and a report overview to ensure that the examinations of devices and forensic analyses have conformed to best practice and that the practitioners' findings have been cross-checked for soundness and completeness as well as for any errors and anomalies.</p><p>The protection of all digital evidence and devices relating to each case must be properly recorded and accounted for in a custody of evidence register, which records all movements of the exhibits and those personnel who have examined or tested them. The appropriate tagging and cross-referencing to the evidence register of computer devices and storage media submitted for analysis must be promulgated in the regulations governing best practice in the laboratory.</p><p>Proficiency testing of all forensic software applications and technical tools must be undertaken prior to their use in examinations. Imaging and copying of digital media onto a forensic computer and copying of other digital media should be in compliance with the laboratory custody of evidence register and evidence analysis and reporting protocols.</p><p>Archives of digital evidence, computing devices, and storage media may often require cataloging and storing for future referral at appeal trials, cold case reviews, and other investigations. Some material may require disposal or destruction after a designated period of time under government evidence, archiving, and record-keeping legislation.</p></div><div class="section" title="The physical security of digital forensic laboratories"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec81"/>The physical security of digital forensic laboratories</h2></div></div></div><p>Physical security is <a id="id365" class="indexterm"/>paramount to controlling and protecting evidence and technical equipment from unauthorized contamination and tampering. It also protects personnel from potential attackers or hostile parties. Evidence must be secured and its chain of custody carefully maintained, managed, and coordinated. Digital evidence and the containers and original hard drives or tapes should be stored in security-grade lockers, cabinets, or safes—preferably secured with combination and keyed locks.</p><p>However, the nature of preparing forensic images and drives for analysis may require the forensic equipment to operate for extended periods, including out-of-office hours. Therefore, the workspace allocated for the evidence processing must itself be guarded from unauthorized internal or external access. Ideally, this may require strict access control of each practitioner's workstation, requiring its isolation from physical access with controlled<a id="id366" class="indexterm"/> entry and some form of security alarm system to notify of unauthorized access attempts. Access to the laboratories and evidence exhibits must be strictly controlled. The supervision of all visitors in order to prevent unauthorized access to and tampering with evidence and related devices is important.</p><p>In addition to physical security protecting the perimeter of the laboratory and some degree of internal segregation of workstations, computer monitors should not be viewable from outside through the laboratory windows to prevent any privacy compromise.</p></div><div class="section" title="Network and electronic requirements of digital forensic laboratories"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec82"/>Network and electronic requirements of digital forensic laboratories</h2></div></div></div><p>Reliable and <a id="id367" class="indexterm"/>approved electrical infrastructure is an essential requirement for protecting sensitive equipment from damaging peaks and troughs in the power charge. Ideally, each computer circuit should be limited to two terminals and peripheral equipment to avoid power drains and outages. Isolating each computer system from other systems reduces power issues and enhances the security of the data being examined.</p><p>Each practitioner/examiner<a id="id368" class="indexterm"/> requires a separate workstation and storage space for exhibits being currently examined. Ideally, the size of the workstation for each practitioner should be a minimum of 6 square meters and include a workbench for disassembling computing devices as well as one for undertaking analysis of recovered data. Network access should also be available to practitioners as they may often need Internet access to check information recovered during analysis. However, there are some inherent risks in doing so, especially if other users with access to the network connection gain information about the examination. Some measure to protect against such interception and conceal the research activity must be in place.</p><p>The electrical cabling should be designed to reduce the harmonics typical in computer networks that shorten the life of other equipment such as monitors. Surge protectors for all sensitive equipment, uninterrupted power supply to prevent data loss in the event of power outages, and simplified cable management at each workstation are essential enhancements.</p><p>Electromagnetic interference can potentially contaminate digital data stored on a range of devices that have Wi-Fi communication installed or attached to the device. Mobile phones are one such example, as are many other devices, including computers equipped with Bluetooth and other forms of Wi-Fi communication hardware. Digital forensics examinations of such devices would require that they be disarmed and unable to communicate with local communication networks.</p><p>It is standard <a id="id369" class="indexterm"/>procedure when commencing data recovery from mobile devices to remove SIM cards from mobile devices and switch the devices to flight mode to prevent them from communicating with external communication points. This prevents new data being downloaded to the device or existing data being modified or deleted, which would deny the practitioner the recovery of all potential evidence. It is far better to shield the device prior to it being powered on.</p><p>Such testing is carried out in screened rooms that are sealed with several layers of fine metal mesh or perforated metal. The metal layers are grounded to dissipate any electric currents generated from external or internal electromagnetic fields in order to block a large amount of the electromagnetic interference that may damage devices being examined and alter data stored in them. These rooms may be substituted by forensic (<span class="emphasis"><em>Michael Faraday</em></span>) bags that are portable and can be taken to a crime scene to protect and examine a mobile device. They are in effect Faraday cages capable of blocking electrical interference to protect electronic equipment from the potentially damaging effects of external radio frequency interference.</p><p>Air conditioning and <a id="id370" class="indexterm"/>dust-minimizing (antistatic) carpeting for personnel well-being and maintaining the correct room temperature for servers and computer equipment is also essential. Acoustic soundproofing should also be installed because of the confidential nature of examinations to ensure there is no violation of case privacy.</p></div><div class="section" title="Dilemmas presently confronting digital forensics laboratories"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec83"/>Dilemmas presently confronting digital forensics laboratories</h2></div></div></div><p>The proliferation of<a id="id371" class="indexterm"/> cybercrime-related offences is now significantly higher than conventional forms of crime. Cybercrimes cover a broad range of offences and most notably include credit card fraud, identity theft, phishing attempts, extortion, and unauthorized access to e-mail. This explosion of large datasets coupled with the increasing profusion of computing devices has already made it impracticable for law enforcement laboratories to examine all data and devices that might contain potential evidence.</p><p>Many law enforcement agencies have responded by resorting to inefficient triage processes and case prioritization, meaning that all but those cases categorized as high priority may not be processed for months or perhaps years—hardly effective policing. Concomitant with these deficiencies are concerns expressed over practitioners with low levels of forensic skills being able to complete high-quality digital crime scene reconstructions.</p><p>To save time, practitioners sometimes use a triage process to take a snapshot of the media to determine whether it <a id="id372" class="indexterm"/>contains evidence of value prior to undertaking a more complete examination, notwithstanding efforts to reduce the size of forensic image files and case data through file compression. Storage and archiving this data is still a time-consuming task, which is not really offset by data size reduction. The number of storage devices and forensic images taken of these devices has increased significantly and raised concerns from forensic laboratories, contributing to large backlogs of work and serious processing errors. This backlog is further aggravated by the increase in the size of datasets.</p></div></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Emerging problems confronting practitioners because of increasingly large and widely dispersed datasets"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl1sec42"/>Emerging problems confronting practitioners because of increasingly large and widely dispersed datasets</h1></div></div></div><p>Despite many <a id="id373" class="indexterm"/>commercial forensic software vendors endeavoring to meet the challenges of the changing nature of digital evidence and growing volume of datasets, it has not alleviated or addressed the momentous problem of data storage. The storage problem cannot be overstated. Cataloging and saving digital evidence for future retrieval and examination is a time-consuming and costly exercise, irrespective of the lower costs and higher storage capacity of storage media. A point to consider is the availability of what become legacy or redundant forensic tools that may not be available if not backed up themselves for later use. There may also be future licensing issues to enable the use of the tools, especially problematic if the tool manufacturer/vendor is no longer in business.</p><p>Smaller-size data requires less storage and is easier to archive. The benefit of the ISeekExplorer forensic container, for example, is that it provides a permanent safe harbor for evidence and uses significantly less storage space than conventional containers (this is described in more detail later in this chapter).</p><p>Digital evidence analysis usually involves processing large datasets, and using existing forensic tools requires technical expertise and understanding seldom possessed by legal practitioners and IT managers, for example. Furthermore, the technical complexity of digital evidence sometimes leads to misunderstandings about digital evidence tendered in legal cases. Although the forensic processing of large datasets could theoretically be completed with current forensic tools, this would be hugely time-consuming and calls for urgent research to alleviate the problem of large datasets.</p><p>I contend that there is no real distinction between criminal (mostly law enforcement) and civil examinations when using digital forensics processes and tools, as each group of stakeholders is<a id="id374" class="indexterm"/> looking for the same sort of evidence, but arguably to different standards. I further contend that the approach that has been used in the past for e-discovery, which often involves large numbers of machines, now needs to be applied to digital forensics, with some refinements, as the only way to handle large data volumes, although not necessarily the same large number of different sources.</p><p>Consequently, the challenges of storing large datasets and analyzing their contents in the search for evidence is formidable, and sometimes this has a detrimental effect on legal hearings. The objectives of locating and preserving digital evidence in criminal and civil settings are similar, but the forensic processes and tools used have developed differently in each environment, which are described in the following two subsections.</p><div class="section" title="Debunking the myth of forensic imaging"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec84"/>Debunking the myth of forensic imaging</h2></div></div></div><p>The courts expect that<a id="id375" class="indexterm"/> digital evidence is recovered using sound forensic processes that eliminate at best and minimize at worst any modification of the digital information. This has been misinterpreted in e-discovery and, to some extent, in criminal digital forensics to mean that in every case, the complete set of digital information on a device must be imaged.</p><p>In many jurisdictions, most notably the United States, there is no prerequisite for a forensic image to be made. What the court needs to be satisfied with is that the evidence collected is forensically sound in that it can be shown to be unmodified and uncontaminated. This should, as shown in <a class="link" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Recovering and Preserving Digital Evidence">Chapter 4</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Recovering and Preserving Digital Evidence</em></span>, include a reliable and trustworthy account and log of how the data was recovered and by what process.</p><p>Section 901(a) of the United States Federal Rules of Evidence, which holds sway in most civil and criminal court case matters, stipulates that authentication of exhibits, including digital evidence, must be supported with sufficient proof as to the authenticity of the process used to recover the evidence. In civil cases, there is a predilection by courts and parties to a case for there to be an "over-collection" of evidence, as evinced in cases where imaging has been used. There are also concerns that too much irrelevant information may be examined in breach of the privacy of other parties from whom the data is collected.</p><p>In particular, what is needed is some perceptive reasoning as to what information should be selected for recovery, rather than the bucket approach of full-drive imaging involving the complete copying of hard drives. In outdated theory, the data collected is supposed to be unmodified and must include every bit on the drive, including deleted and partially erased data from allocated space. A forensic image provides access to all data recovered during the imaging process, including deleted, erased, and corrupted data. This allows the practitioner to reconstruct crime histories but comes at a cost in terms of expertise and time and often produces no beneficial outcome to the investigation.</p><p>Forensic images<a id="id376" class="indexterm"/> are more often used as a standard process for criminal investigations but are also frequently used for corporate investigations when there is a suspicion of deliberate data deletion that requires special tools to recover evidence from an image. In fact, in cases where there is a need to recover hidden and altered data, imaging is still considered the preferred option.</p><p>The disadvantage of imaging is that the process recovers every bit of data from the device being imaged, and because of the size of the drives, images are now significantly large in size. The size is significant because the images contain mostly irrelevant data, which can make it difficult and time-consuming to locate the evidence and traditionally required a high level of expertise. Often, no more than a small percentage of the image is of evidentiary value. Moreover, the practitioner must travel to the location to access the computer device and complete the imaging process by connecting to the device or hard drive. This adds to the time taken to recover the data as well as the cost of personnel involved.</p><p>This time-consuming and resource-hungry practice of forensic imaging is fast becoming untenable because more cases involve large datasets and suggest more efficacious processes than those that exist. While forensic imaging is the norm for criminal investigations, it is estimated that in more than 90 percent of civil cases where forensic imaging was undertaken, it was an overindulgent and unjustified use of resources and money. The same trend is likely to occur in criminal investigations over the next few years. Moreover, forensic imaging tools do not effectively recover evidence from web-based e-mail accounts, Dropbox, or other accounts held in the cloud or other remote locations.</p></div><div class="section" title="Dilemmas presently confronting digital forensics practitioners"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec85"/>Dilemmas presently confronting digital forensics practitioners</h2></div></div></div><p>Practitioners are <a id="id377" class="indexterm"/>now processing increasingly large, terabyte-sized datasets but are confounded by inadequate analysis tools and time-consuming and inefficient recovery processes. Forensic practitioners were struggling with processing large datasets as early as 2004, being constrained by the time-hungry hashing and indexing algorithms required to analyze data post capture. Even with moderately large datasets of, say, 500 gigabytes, processing is problematic as it is inordinately and inherently time-consuming. This is because the data extraction and analytic processes become extremely slow and inefficient.</p><p>For over a decade, researchers have argued that practitioners must address the problem of locating and recovering relevant data using what they described as inadequate forensic tools and processes. It was also predicted that the rapidly increasing size of datasets would require <a id="id378" class="indexterm"/>more sophisticated, automated analysis to help locate and identify target evidence and possibly required significantly more computing power. More astute observers recognized that enhanced automated processes were needed as part of the timely and reliable identification and classification of relevant evidence buried in large and dispersed datasets.</p><p>Overreliance on forensic imaging and a reluctance to undertake live recovery of devices such as desktop computers and network servers has stymied practitioners as well as forcing them to spend an inordinate amount of time in unnecessary recovery, storage, and analysis. The ability of conventional forensic tools to make complete images and for those images to be reconstructed so that all the data can be viewed has repeatedly foundered. Yet, imaging rules supreme—at least for the time being.</p><p>But there is some encouraging news for practitioners. Simpler processes that comply with the expectations of the legal system are needed, and these are described in the following section.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Processes and forensic tools to assist practitioners to deal more effectively with these challenges"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl1sec43"/>Processes and forensic tools to assist practitioners to deal more effectively with these challenges</h1></div></div></div><p>In sharp contrast to imaging, targeted live recovery using forensically sound tools and processes is possible. Evidence<a id="id379" class="indexterm"/> is sought and not altered by the searching process in that the file data and metadata remain unaltered. Recovered data is collected in a forensically sound and password-protected evidence container. E-discovery tools have been heralding this change—a change I predict will spill over into criminal evidence recovery processes.</p><div class="section" title="E-discovery evidence recovery and preservation"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec86"/>E-discovery evidence recovery and preservation</h2></div></div></div><p>Recent developments in the technology available for undertaking e-discovery are now signaling a paradigm<a id="id380" class="indexterm"/> shift away from the cumbersome existing processes used to capture and identify digital evidence. For companies involved in civil litigation, there is an increase in electronic discovery involving the capture of relevant digital information for evidentiary purposes.</p><p>Existing processes involve<a id="id381" class="indexterm"/> technologies that sometimes challenge the skills and experience of digital forensic and legal practitioners, thus creating a need for specialist digital forensic practitioners. The cost of these experts is high, which is an added burden to the discovery process on top of the high cost of the mandatory teams of legal analysts processing recovered data.</p><p>Processing times for limited keyword searches of the captured e-discovery data, for example, is also time-consuming, often taking days and weeks, and the large number of search hits for review are often overwhelming to process. Evidence examinations are hampered by the limited processing capabilities of human analysts, which are further aggravated by the increase in the size of datasets and post-processing reviews. The opportunities for practitioners to complete meticulous reviews of all captured evidence and search large<a id="id382" class="indexterm"/> datasets for evidence has long since passed and clearly signals a need for better digital evidence capture and processing.</p><p>E-discovery is<a id="id383" class="indexterm"/> almost entirely a civil matter, involving disputes between different organizations, so the concept of "evidence" is slightly different. However, civil investigations sometimes result in evidence recovered being used in criminal trials, disciplinary hearings, and other tribunal proceedings, such as unfair dismissal cases. Usually, cases that center on e-discovery require the litigants to identify information relevant to the legal action, by completing searches across their networks and storage systems. Any documents that are identified as relevant to the action are extracted, processed to remove irrelevant documents, and provided to the requesting litigant. Note that no forensic imaging has taken place.</p><p>A conundrum exists between the various e-discovery processes in using automated tools to prioritize and select documents for review, typically considered cost savers but an inferior alternative to tedious, manual reviews requiring the assessment of each document in response to a production request and to determine privilege. <span class="emphasis"><em>Grossman and Cormack</em></span> (2011) quote the <span class="emphasis"><em>Sedona Conference Best Practices Commentary on the Use of Search and Information Retrieval Methods in E-Discovery</em></span>, which cautions that "[t]here appears to be a myth that manual review by humans of large amounts of information is as accurate and complete as possible – perhaps even perfect – and constitutes the gold standard by which all searches should be measured. Even assuming that the profession had the time and resources to continue to conduct manual review of massive sets of electronic data sets (which it does not), the relative efficacy of that approach versus utilizing newly developed automated methods of review remains very much open to debate."</p><p>The process of indexing in e-discovery is carried out by software applications that scan the readable text of numerous electronic files and incorporate them into database tables of search terms corresponding to the text files. Indexing is intended to optimize subsequent search and retrieval and is useful for managing captive repositories, centralized data archives, and business-record repositories.</p><p>Typically, in index-based and non-index-based e-discovery data collection, the software is installed on the client server or network, which permits the inspection and indexing of the selected corpus, which is held as a searchable on an agent or index server for later retrieval and processing, as shown in the following figure:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/4931_05_01.jpg" alt="E-discovery evidence recovery and preservation"/><div class="caption"><p>Client-server indexing of networked data</p></div></div><p>The holders of <a id="id384" class="indexterm"/>
<span class="strong"><strong>Electronically Stored Information</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>ESI</strong></span>), corporations or customers, wherever they may be, certainly<a id="id385" class="indexterm"/> are not aware that in order to perform most ESI e-mail database processing, literally every intellectual property value they have, without their conscious knowledge, is being moved in<a id="id386" class="indexterm"/> bulk to the home turf of the reviewing company just to junk 90 percent of the data. It is perhaps worth noting that a huge risk of not just data breach but corporate espionage could take place at the datacenters of the reviewers as well.</p><p>I, based on case work in this field, firmly believe that it would be preferable if the processing was completed during the acquisition phase. In the end, the storage of images for the sake of it not only costs storage space, time, money, and management but also security, and it poses a potential risk of escalating data requests outside the bounds of the case at hand as well. An investigation that starts on one track might inadvertently find sufficient tangents of data of other events to expand the scope beyond the points giving rise to the matter in the first place.</p></div><div class="section" title="Enhanced digital evidence recovery and preservation"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec87"/>Enhanced digital evidence recovery and preservation</h2></div></div></div><p>The limitation of the indexing processes for e-discovery is that managing large archives results in slower searches and missed files. Many organizations have complained about significant<a id="id387" class="indexterm"/> difficulties managing indexes, notably, a requirement to re-index broken archives periodically, thereby negating any risk-mitigation benefit. Concerns have also been raised as to the ability of<a id="id388" class="indexterm"/> index-based e-discovery tools to locate key files subject to privilege. Checking samples of large e-mail databases that had been examined found artifacts missed during the indexing process.</p><p>Recognizing resource costs, a pressing reliance on and need for expertise in the face of the rapid increase in e-discovery, and the challenge of searching the growing size of datasets, I identified some enhancements that were required to address these challenges. A review of various tools and specialist expertise in e-discovery, my previous knowledge of e-discovery indexing servers as the predominant process to locate relevant evidence, and <span class="emphasis"><em>Adam's</em></span> (2015) earlier experimentation prompted preliminary research into the tools available to see whether some or all of the desired enhancements were available.</p><p>In 2015, I and my co-researchers looked at the unique, patented automaton of Xtremeforensics ISeekDiscovery and noted that it made claim to a number of promising outcomes for stakeholders involved in e-discovery and potentially for law enforcement analysis. The ISeekDiscovery suite, now being marketed by eReveal Technologies Pty Ltd as eFinder, consists of a configuration utility, a search tool, and a review tool that do not require installation on the target devices or network servers. They are explained here:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The configuration utility, ISeekDesigner, facilitates the creation of a configuration file containing the search terms, which can consist of whole paragraphs if required, to refine the search.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The search tool, ISeekDiscovery, requires no installation and can be run by plugging in a USB device.

Longer search phrases optimize the locating of specific file and e-mail <a id="id392" class="indexterm"/>content to assist the investigation. This in turn filters out many irrelevant hits and accelerates the<a id="id393" class="indexterm"/> searching process, and it reduces the data captured and facilitates more effective capture of desired datasets:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/4931_05_03.jpg" alt="Enhanced digital evidence recovery and preservation"/><div class="caption"><p>The opening pane of the ISeekDesigner help wizard (Search terms)</p></div></div><p>The purpose of ISeekDesigner is to create a configuration file containing search terms and other search process parameters. The configuration file, usually a small file of a few megabytes, is loaded with the similarly small ISeekDiscovery executable (the automaton) on a client's network server or computer terminal. No program is installed (a blessing to the network administrator), and the automaton package may be sent to a remote location by e-mail. The ISeekDiscovery executable is launched and commences a low-level sweep of the network or computer while the system is still running. No files are altered and no indexing is undertaken. This results in quicker data capture without disrupting the normal functionality of the network or attached terminals.</p><p>The following screenshot shows a view of the automaton searching one of the drives on a computer terminal and shows the drive selected being searched, the progress of the search, the amount of data read, and captured hits:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/4931_05_04.jpg" alt="Enhanced digital evidence recovery and preservation"/><div class="caption"><p>Viewing the ISeekDiscovery automaton searching a selected computer drive</p></div></div><p>Once the searching is completed, usually in only a fraction of the time it takes conventional index-based tools to complete the task, the automaton notifies the practitioner by e-mail <a id="id394" class="indexterm"/>or through the viewing panel about the number of hits recorded and the reason for the file selection. The third tool in the suite, ISeekExplorer, allows the practitioner to view the selected <a id="id395" class="indexterm"/>files and their contents and the file metadata and rationale for the search with respect to each file captured, as shown in the following screenshot. The files are stored in a password-protected <code class="literal">.ISK</code> encrypted forensic container for privacy as well as to facilitate legal privilege:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/4931_05_05.jpg" alt="Enhanced digital evidence recovery and preservation"/><div class="caption"><p>The ISeekExplorer view of the files captured and file content and metadata</p></div></div></div><div class="section" title="The benefits of enhanced recovery tools in criminal investigations"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec88"/>The benefits of enhanced recovery tools in criminal investigations</h2></div></div></div><p>It was noted that in contrast to traditional e-discovery or digital forensic tools, the practitioner or analyst <a id="id396" class="indexterm"/>can compile the searches and review captured data for relevance. ISeekExplorer facilitates the indexing of the processed data for quicker review after capture and not while on the target dataset, and it provides the following enhancements:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Indexing without evidence contamination to produce sound evidence identification</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">A significant reduction in the time required to complete data capture: indexing versus searching</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">A significant reduction in the amount of data requiring capture</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Avoidance of site visits and associated travel</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">A "safe harbor" for captured data that can be transported speedily and at lower cost</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">No contamination of the evidence collated</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Simplicity of access to the target datasets without an Internet connection or software installation</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Simple executables with a minimum of technical expertise required and avoidance of the tedium of setting up complex capture processes</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Customizable search options compatible with analyst and legal team objectives</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Enhancing post-capture filtering and analysis</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">A process capable of being used for crime investigations and intelligence analysis</li></ul></div><p>Captured files can <a id="id397" class="indexterm"/>be indexed within the container using sophisticated software embedded in ISeekExplorer.

The ISeek development team (incidentally incorporating experienced forensic practitioners and forensic software specialists) is presently incorporating and testing the code to enable ISeekDiscovery to recover selected Windows Registry hives and keys and deleted files from free space. This adds to the relevance of the tool being deployed by law enforcement, especially when tracking evidence on dispersed networks such as the cloud or large network servers.</p><p>Tools such as ISeekDiscovery now permit information managers and law enforcement officers with minimal training to undertake searches across a broad range of data repositories without complex forensic tools and the assistance of specialists. In theory, lawyers and auditors with a modicum of IT and forensic training can replace expensive specialists with such tools and take control of the management of their own evidence retrieval. The convenience of having only relevant data secured in a protected forensic container avoids storage issues and lengthy indexing and searching processes.</p><p>I will go further, asserting<a id="id398" class="indexterm"/> that the search and retrieval features offered by such tools can also be used in criminal investigations, where the preoccupation with forensic images can be replaced with a more pragmatic process. Such processes that are search-oriented and evidence-led offer significant enhancements to forensic analysis and significant savings in terms of resource costs. The intelligence and defense communities may also benefit as the search strategy offered through such processes could be applied to field investigations and protracted cases where computer systems and datasets are being interrogated as part of an investigation.</p><p>

Considering the heavy caseload of law enforcement agencies and digital forensic practitioners and the high cost of using their services, it seems long overdue that some form of basic training and tools such as ISeek be able to assist stakeholders in managing the identification and collection of potential evidence without contamination.</p><p>This section looks at this deficiency in digital evidence collection and preservation and offers some pragmatic solutions.</p><div class="section" title="The challenges facing non-forensic law enforcement agents"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec89"/>The challenges facing non-forensic law enforcement agents</h2></div></div></div><p>Law enforcement<a id="id400" class="indexterm"/> field agents are often tasked to be evidence collectors. In effect, they carry out para-forensic roles because of the heavy workload of specialist crime scene personnel and forensic examiners, who may not always be readily available to help stabilize the crime scene and recover evidence in a timely manner. Law enforcement agents attending the scene of an incident are now increasingly confronted with seizing and examining computers and data held on computer networks, mobile devices, digital cameras, and video recorders.</p><p>It may often be of importance to access these devices to obtain information as a matter of operational urgency rather than primarily as evidence collection and preservation. Whether or how they do it is a judgment call for the officer at the scene. Operational requirements that, for example, may lead to the apprehension of a suspect or prevent harm to others or<a id="id401" class="indexterm"/> severe damage to property have an overriding priority over evidence collection. But that is not to say that some form of awareness and response training cannot be given to agents in the field who are not forensic specialists.</p><p>Data recovery from mobile phones, for example, has traditionally been handled by computer crime teams experienced in recovery with access to a laboratory or forensic field kits. These teams are often centrally located with heavy caseloads and regular and time-consuming court attendance as expert witnesses, and are usually focused on higher-level categories of cases. At best, they may only be able to communicate directions to field agents as to the best evidence recovery response, sometimes leaving the field agents with limited guidance, no experience, and no effective tools to preserve the evidence.</p></div><div class="section" title="Enhancing law enforcement agents as first respondents"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec90"/>Enhancing law enforcement agents as first respondents</h2></div></div></div><p>The use of portable<a id="id402" class="indexterm"/> mobile phone recovery units for law enforcement officers, using reasonably priced recovery software and some basic training for nominated targets in central and more widely dispersed operational locations, has provided some benefit. While it has reduced the overreliance on central forensic teams, it has been contingent on the ability of agencies to purchase sounds units in sufficiently large numbers to make a difference. Emerging mobile phone encryption and new phone models can make these field kits obsolete overnight.</p><p>The training of designated personnel who use these kits has, on occasion, proved to be ineffectual when the operator has been confronted with the quirkiness of a broad range of mobile phone types. The effectiveness of the kits and the ability of the operators observed by me on recent occasions raised doubts as to the overall benefits when evidence that could have been recovered was not. If such strategies are to be used, the soundness of the equipment must be rigorously tested. Moreover, ongoing training for the operators must be provided and monitored to guarantee the best outcomes.</p><p>Apart from mobile phones, the handling of desktop and laptop computers needs a pragmatic process to preserve evidence as well as a workable guide to evidence recovery for case prognosis. The basic requirement to achieve this consists of:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">A reasonable budget to set up and maintain the initiative</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The selection of affordable, proven, and reliable software and hardware that is relatively easy to use and update</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Reliable training personnel to ensure operators are properly trained and receive ongoing support and retraining when required</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">A review<a id="id403" class="indexterm"/> made of the process to determine its success and ultimately its importance (to enhance future budgeting)</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Flexibility of review to ensure that the process keeps pace with the ongoing change in technologies</li></ul></div><p>Skills required as part of the process include the ability to image devices or, preferably, search for evidence that can be stored in forensic secure digital evidence containers such as the ISeek <code class="literal">.ISK</code> evidence container. This may be achieved by using a 64-gigabyte USB thumb drive and a predesigned ISeek configuration file, with which the contents of a device, such as e-mail records or correspondence files, may be selected and recovered. This is the only tool available to boot up an Apple computer to retrieve information. The automaton can also capture the drive contents or selected folders and partitions. The critical process involved is designing the search criteria to meet the needs of the investigator. While this may appear straightforward, it does require some thought and experience in using search terms.</p><p>The recovery can take between 30 minutes to several hours depending on the size of the drive and may also be deployed on a network server with a modicum of operator training. Once the search hit results are known, the data may be selected and either accessed on site or sent to a more secure central handling center for further analysis. Recovered datasets may be migrated to processing applications such as <span class="strong"><strong>Relativity</strong></span>; however, the ISeek suite provides an application interface, XtremeReporting, that assists legal and analysis teams to process data expeditiously.</p><p>Alternatively, the agents can use ISeekExtractor to export selected files and folders from the <code class="literal">.ISK</code> file for local or central location analysis, as shown in this screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/4931_05_07.jpg" alt="Enhancing law enforcement agents as first respondents"/><div class="caption"><p>The ISeekExtractor API tool</p></div></div><p>The extracted <a id="id404" class="indexterm"/>folders may then be catalogued and conveniently searched for essential evidence, as shown here:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/4931_05_08.jpg" alt="Enhancing law enforcement agents as first respondents"/><div class="caption"><p>Folders of extracted e-mail messages</p></div></div><p>The following screenshot shows the contents of a typical folder, showing the e-mail header file, the body of the e-mail and the attachment—in this case, a PDF file:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/4931_05_09.jpg" alt="Enhancing law enforcement agents as first respondents"/><div class="caption"><p>View of the e-mail header, body, and attachment extracted into the examination folder</p></div></div><p>Use of the automaton is far simpler than imaging, even with IXImager, and only requires access to the<a id="id405" class="indexterm"/> device and appropriate design of the configuration file.

It shows what can be done to speed up and remove the complexity of the digital forensic component of a crime investigation.</p></div><div class="section" title="The challenges facing IT administrators, legal teams, forensic auditors, and other first respondents"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec91"/>The challenges facing IT administrators, legal teams, forensic auditors, and other first respondents</h2></div></div></div><p>The custodians of desktop and laptop machines and network administrators know the characteristics of their data<a id="id407" class="indexterm"/> holdings, user access, and running applications. They may be the first respondent to discover that some form of improper use of the system<a id="id408" class="indexterm"/> has taken place. This may include a hacker attack, insider fraud, or personnel misconduct. For organizations, personnel have access<a id="id409" class="indexterm"/> through a desktop terminal, portable laptop, or mobile device, usually linked to the organization's network server by direct cabling or remote access, Wi-Fi connection, and so forth.</p><p>Often, the investigation will require inculpatory evidence that typically is in the form of personal or business correspondence, notably e-mail messages and attachments, text files, photographs and diagrams, and logs of database access and document management systems. Also, the investigation may require a deeper level of forensic examination to look for hidden and deleted information that has been deliberately concealed.</p><p>These types of investigations may be triggered by a broad range of events, including:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Breaches of confidentiality</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The sudden and unexplained departure of a staff member</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Evidence of fraud or misappropriation of an organization's funds or assets</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Account audit anomalies</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Misuse of Internet browsing privileges</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Complaints of misconduct made by clients and other staff members of misbehavior, sexual harassment, and other breaches of the employment code</li></ul></div><p>Evidence stored on<a id="id410" class="indexterm"/> desktops and personal computing devices may well be forensically imaged or, in the case of mobile phones, data extraction can be made using a range of forensic tools. However, these tools may not be available, and no qualified users are available in-house.</p><p>For extracting data from a network server, the network administrator may use a range of data backup applications such as Safeback or ShadowProtect to make logical copies of the server and copies of available backup tapes. However, when viewing and accessing files to determine<a id="id411" class="indexterm"/> whether there has been a security breach or evidence of some transgression, there is a possibility of altering the file data, timestamps, and audit trail logs unintentionally. There is also the possibility, if the extracted information is presented in court, that the opposing team may dispute the authenticity of the data, claiming that it may have been altered during recovery or deliberately by hostile parties.</p><p>These tools take a logical copy of the server and, for example, any database files hosted on the server, such as e-mail server databases and other accounting and administrative databases. A copy <a id="id412" class="indexterm"/>of the server file at a given point and all available backup tapes (on-site or off) is an expedient measure, as it allows the organization to recommence business while the original dataset containing potential evidence remains intact. The backup will copy all system files and, to reiterate, this is time-consuming and results in more data being collected than will be required. The practitioner is also in the hands of the network administrator, who may not be on site or unavailable at critical times to make a backup of the server data.</p><p>Normally, the network administrator will save everything so that examination of relevant data may take place when desired, although, unlike a forensic imaging, it will be a logical copy of the data and not a bit-for-bit exact physical image that would facilitate locating hidden and deleted files. For a 1-terabyte network server, the copying process would take between 3 and 5 hours, but considerably more time and storage space would be required for a larger network.</p><p>It may be a matter of isolating e-mail databases relating to dubious activities based on user identities, time frames, and subject matter. In an organization of any size, it is unlikely that an investigation will examine the information holdings relating to every employee or manager, and may from the outset focus on one or more employees. On the other hand, it may be unclear as to what the identity of possible culprits is, but an event or subject matter may provide links to them.</p><p>Having an image of the server, if possible, may be useful for indexing and searching for evidence, but what if the network is dispersed and it is impractical to consider imaging the large dataset? Copying and restoring an image of a network is time-consuming and can take between a day and <a id="id413" class="indexterm"/>several days to complete. So much data is saved, yet little of it is required. If the <a id="id414" class="indexterm"/>appointed investigator is tasked to look for only certain parts of the network thought relevant to<a id="id415" class="indexterm"/> the incident, there is no guarantee that they will contain all the available evidence. Staff terminals also take time to image and then search for evidence, and this is not without its challenges, as will be demonstrated in <a class="link" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Selecting and Analyzing Digital Evidence">Chapter 6</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Selecting and Analyzing Digital Evidence</em></span>.</p></div><div class="section" title="Enhancing IT administrators, legal team members, and other personnel as first respondents"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec92"/>Enhancing IT administrators, legal team members, and other personnel as first respondents</h2></div></div></div><p>So, rather than<a id="id416" class="indexterm"/> adopting imaging as the best process, I and my co-researchers use and commend the use of the ISeek automaton to locate and recover data of potential value. This is exemplified in the case study at the end of the chapter, but consider<a id="id417" class="indexterm"/> the time benefit of being able to interrogate a server and desk terminals using the automaton to collate a manageable container of information from which an early and quick prognosis can assist the investigation.</p><p>For example, the e-mail server may contain thousands of user databases, yet the investigation is seeking the e-mails of only one or perhaps two internal users, for a specified time frame, engaging in certain activities. The automaton can be configured to look for e-mails and attachments in the context of the inquiry. It can filter by file size, type, and periods of time to avoid processing unnecessary data and speed up the process of locating evidence and leads for further inquiry.</p><p>In addition, these types of investigations require the large e-mail and document sets to be filtered and cataloged efficiently so as to reduce the time spent on and tedium experienced by the examining team personnel. The same stratagem used by law enforcement agents to search for and contain selected data applies here. Moreover, while the administrator may be able to isolate a user and e-mail accounts, the possibility remains that information of value may be overlooked in other locations on the server not evident to the examining team. The team may lack sufficient technical knowledge and experience regarding the less likely locations of evidence. The automaton does not have to rely on extracting large datasets and can work quickly and efficiently on those drives where evidence may sit.</p><p>Another benefit of administrators and auditors using the automaton is that they can be involved in configuring the search terms, which can be launched on the server or terminal without the installation of any software application and without the physical presence of a forensic practitioner. This broadens the scope of investigations that may otherwise be delayed or abandoned because of the cost of hiring an expensive practitioner and associated travel and accommodation costs. It can all be accomplished by e-mail and telephone communication.</p><p>Securing the evidence, or what appears on first inspection to be information that may assist a later<a id="id418" class="indexterm"/> investigation, is a high priority. Making sure that the evidence is kept in pristine condition has been emphasized in previous chapters, as has the likelihood of its contamination by hostile parties as well as those inspecting it and trying to save it to a safe location.</p><p>Again, the ISeekDiscovery tool has the capability of being quickly deployed with a simple configuration file<a id="id419" class="indexterm"/> to enable the capture of drives or folders where information needs to be placed in a "safe harbor". The evidence container is password protected and encrypted to restrict access to the recovered evidence to ensure confidentiality and safekeeping. This figure shows the selection of a drive folder for capture by ISeekDiscovery:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/4931_05_10.jpg" alt="Enhancing IT administrators, legal team members, and other personnel as first respondents"/><div class="caption"><p>Using ISeekDiscovery to capture a drive folder for safekeeping</p></div></div><p>These are software application solutions potentially empowering first respondents. While the tools and the training necessary are not without cost, they do enable the responders to take some ownership of the problem of digital information in their care and take direct responsibility for protecting recovered evidence in civil and criminal settings. <a class="link" href="ch08.html" title="Chapter 8. Examining Browsers, E-mails, Messaging Systems, and Mobile Phones">Chapter 8</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Examining Browsers, E-mails, Messaging Systems, and Mobile Phones</em></span>, will look at forensic processes to enhance the recovery and preservation of digital evidence, including data stored on remote locations, such as the cloud.</p><p>The following case study is based on what started out as a business insolvency that, as it later transpired, involved the theft of large sums of client and employee funds by the principal owner <a id="id420" class="indexterm"/>of the business.

Letters of demand were received from contractors engaged in the maintenance of and repairs to rental properties managed by the firm, complaining of non-payment of their work. Clients complained that monies placed in trust funds as part of the sale and purchase of listed properties were not cleared within stipulated periods. Letters from the firm's financiers over default payments of loans and staff members not receiving salaries and commissions all added to the clamor.</p><p>The principal was questioned as to the nature of the problem and, after a month of apparent prevarication, departed the firm in possession of his work computer and mobile phone. Attempts to interview the principal failed and it was then discovered that the principal had been registered as a bankrupt. An acute shortage of funds and an inability to meet its creditors' demands forced the firm into involuntary administration.</p><p>It soon became evident that significant funds had been secreted out of the firm through a number of shelf companies and trusts controlled by the principal. These funds were the bulk of the firm's reserves, amounting to some $5 million, including trust fund holdings of clients. Even the employees' superannuation fund was devoid of funds; the firm's monthly fund contributions were 6 months in arrears.</p></div><div class="section" title="The investigation"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec94"/>The investigation</h2></div></div></div><p>The forensic audit team<a id="id425" class="indexterm"/> commenced its investigation into the affairs of the firm and noted that some important business ledgers, containing recent transactions relating to funds that had been emptied just prior to the principal's unexpected departure, were missing. The principal's missing laptop and office phones denied the auditors the principal's e-mail and telephone communications. Examination of the firm's accounts through its bank confirmed that large amounts of funds had been transferred to other businesses by the authorized account holder—the principal.</p><p>The initial suspicion<a id="id426" class="indexterm"/> was that the principal had been involved in the transfer of the funds and may have used companies he owned to do so. There was some suspicion that documents relating to transfers and these companies had been forged to facilitate the transfer and avoid detection by the bank and create unwanted attention.</p></div><div class="section" title="The practitioner's brief"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec95"/>The practitioner's brief</h2></div></div></div><p>While the<a id="id427" class="indexterm"/> misappropriation of the funds implicated the principal, it was necessary to demonstrate knowledge, involvement, and motivation that it was for criminal gain and not some other less onerous reason. Proof of this could be provided by the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">E-mail and other communications, including attachments relating to the principal and possible accomplices relating to dubious transactions</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">All communications relating to the indebtedness of the firm</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Traces of electronic copies of missing business ledgers (the audit team would separately examine the financial and client business database to identify missing transactions)</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Word and Excel documents that relate to the principal and business entities relating to dubious financial transactions</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">All <code class="literal">.PDF</code> files that appear to have been scanned and may reveal forgery relating to dubious transactions</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">All applications that relate to copying and changing documents into PDF format and could facilitate the suspected forgery</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Backups of the principal's mobile phone that may provide additional proof of involvement in the fraud</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Any other information that might provide investigative leads and reconstruct relevant events</li></ul></div></div><div class="section" title="The available evidence"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec96"/>The available evidence</h2></div></div></div><p>The data available to the<a id="id428" class="indexterm"/> practitioner consisted of:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The network server, containing about 800 gigabytes of data, including an e-mail database, a real estate management database, and an accounting database for personnel payroll and business operations</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">17 terminals for employees</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">A backup <a id="id429" class="indexterm"/>drive for the property management database</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">A damaged mobile phone discarded by the principal</li></ul></div></div><div class="section" title="The data extraction process"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec97"/>The data extraction process</h2></div></div></div><p>The network server data was required to be imaged for eventual analysis by the relevant government <a id="id430" class="indexterm"/>department and as the best evidence in the event of any future legal action against the firm and the principal. As the server could not be shut down because of urgent business with irate clients and other commitments, the option of imaging the drive was not feasible. The network administrator, also an unsecured creditor of the firm, isolated the network from the principal and other personnel and made a backup of the drive. The backup took 48 hours to complete because the server refreshed itself and delayed the process. The administrator did, however, provide some 60 gigabytes of e-mail stores of the entire staff members and user terminals. This data was searched using ISeekDiscovery.</p><p>However, this data was not available for analysis for 3 days. The server backup was restored, taking a further 20 hours, and there was another delay in copying the data to a forensic container for the government department.</p><p>Examination of the personnel e-mail <code class="literal">.PST</code> files was completed in under 2 hours using the automaton, locating evidence in the principal's e-mail server account and minimal relevant information in one other staff member's account. This accorded with the auditing team's view that the principal had acted alone.</p><p>This e-mail data could have been recovered on day one by launching the automaton on the server. Other documentary evidence being sought, including a small number of suspected forged or fabricated PDF files and the related software application, could have been captured expeditiously using the automaton. This would have provided the audit team with an earlier insight into the principal's impropriety and identified other probative information and possible links to other perpetrators.</p><p>Six desktop computers used by other personnel were imaged for broader analysis, as it was thought possible that information relating to the fraud may be obtained. Imaging of each device using IXImager was speedy and undertaken concurrently, being completed within 3 hours. The images were mounted and ISeek was used to search for possible evidence and other leads. This was a more time-consuming process than using the automaton on the six terminals concurrently, which, as it transpired, recovered minimal probative information. However, the client was persistent in sticking to the old tried-and-tested processes that took longer, as it transpired.</p><p>Data relating to PDF files and mobile phone and e-mail messages and attachments was obtained through these combined processes and filtered using ISeekExtractor to produce a distillation <a id="id431" class="indexterm"/>of relevant data for the audit team to examine. Evidence of particular importance was extracted and included in the report provided to the forensic audit team for analysis as well as feedback to the practitioner for further searching.</p></div><div class="section" title="The outcome of the recovery and examination"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec98"/>The outcome of the recovery and examination</h2></div></div></div><p>The practitioner had <a id="id432" class="indexterm"/>been provided with sufficient background of the investigation to undertake some analysis and reconstruction to<a id="id433" class="indexterm"/> assist the audit team with the digital evidence. The use of ISeekExplorer to search for and catalog possible evidence and leads from an originally large dataset was relatively uncomplicated and speedy compared to the use of conventional forensic tools.</p><p>Information of value to the audit team was distilled and consisted of:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">E-mails between the principal and the financial institution regarding the transfer of large amounts of funds out of the firm to companies controlled by the principal</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Synchronized e-mail messages recovered from the server backup of the principal's mobile phone regarding suspect financial transactions and the principal's indebtedness</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Identities of family and unit trusts and residential properties owned and controlled by the principal suspected of being involved in illegal transactions</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Documents stored on the principal's server folder relating to scanned written transactions relating to the parlous state of the firm</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Details of bank transfers of significantly large and regular amounts moved from the firm's accounts to other entities of possible relevance to the investigation</li></ul></div><p>What was not found was evidence of any document forgery or software applications that may have been used to alter and forge documents. Messages between the principal and his spouse and family were innocuous and of no relevance to the investigation. No other staff members were implicated in any misdemeanor.</p><p>It was clear that any substantial digital evidence that may have existed was on the principal's missing laptop or another device used away from the workplace. The server e-mail database did provide some of the principal's e-mails but they were not of significant help to the investigation. There is a possibility that any incriminating e-mails using the firm's e-mail server may have been permanently deleted by the principal as the server did not prevent users from making permanent deletions that are unrecoverable. The backup tapes for the server <a id="id434" class="indexterm"/>did not identify any incriminating e-mails. It is more than likely that the actual acts of fraud and forgery did not<a id="id435" class="indexterm"/> take place inside the firm's premises or by using its computers.</p><p>The principal later surrendered the laptop, which was accessed using ISeekDiscovery but only produced a small, but important, amount of potential evidence in the form of a spreadsheet. The file contained what were evidently specific details of the principal's money trail involved in the theft of clients' funds.</p></div><div class="section" title="Conclusion"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec99"/>Conclusion</h2></div></div></div><p>The case described<a id="id436" class="indexterm"/> the examination of a small organization using a combination of old and new forensic processes and clearly demonstrated the benefits of the new technology. For a larger organization, a dump of the selected hits obtained through the automaton would be extracted using ISeekExtractor for end processing using software such as Relativity. A lot of work was done at reduced cost without an overabundance of probative evidence recovered, as it transpired, but the examination that was required and the time saved also reduced the cost to the client.</p></div></div>

<div class="section" title="Summary"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl1sec47"/>Summary</h1></div></div></div><p>The chapter further described the challenges posed by the rapidly increasing size of datasets that makes it difficult to seek digital evidence without considerable expenditure of time, money, and human resources. The questionability of conventional forensic image protection has also been highlighted. The continuing use of forensic imaging is predicted to become less prevalent because of the concomitant increase in the size of secure data stores to preserve the evidence and related resource costs. The use of better tools to process large datasets, identify important evidence, and preserve it in more modest storage sizes is urgently needed.</p><p>The chapter introduced the evidence-searching automaton and demonstrated its value through testing and casework, confirming its effectiveness in overcoming challenges posed to practitioners, with some encouraging results being observed. Such processes offered in the suite of tools should attract the attention of practitioners, not just in the e-discovery field, but also in law enforcement and the intelligence community—communities facing escalating costs, reduced manpower, and limited time to process information in a timely manner. Information managers and the legal fraternity also seek some autonomy from costly specialists and vendors to better manage, capture, and preserve information that may later be required in legal cases.</p><p>I hope that you will benefit from the knowledge gained from this chapter by providing a glimpse into the newly emerging environment of digital evidence handling. These new technologies address the challenges posed by increasingly large and disparate datasets that can no longer be copied through conventional imaging processes for much longer. Not only do these new technologies help address these challenges, the relative simplicity of using them removes much of the mystery surrounding e-discovery experts and vendor hype. IT administrators can now take the opportunity to become involved in the sound capture and management of information likely to be used in court and can become empowered by the new technologies.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Selecting and Analyzing Digital Evidence">Chapter 6</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Selecting and Analyzing Digital Evidence</em></span>, introduces the use of structured processes to navigate acquired forensic images and containers, notably the ISeekExplorer <code class="literal">.ISK</code> container file, to locate and select evidence based on sound forensic practice. The case study provided in this chapter shows how the complexity of a case can become challenging, and so, it is important to have some structured approach to assist the practitioner. Each case is different and can vary quite remarkably, but all share some common characteristics. While there is no substitute for experience, some flexible, pragmatic schema is required to ensure that the examination proceeds in an organized manner.</p><p>The very size of the data recovered means that the best forensic tools are used to complete examinations. <a class="link" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Selecting and Analyzing Digital Evidence">Chapter 6</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Selecting and Analyzing Digital Evidence</em></span>, provides an insight into the forensic tools used to extract and select evidence. It will further describe the emergence of forensic tools that reduce the tedium of and time spent on analysis and retrieving more evidence. The exciting part of forensic examinations is knowing where to look for potential evidence, what you are looking for, and why it may be important and relevant to the investigation, and then finding it. All this comes with experience, for there are many blind canyons to explore, and while the brain is the best forensic tool, it can become tired, confused, and frustrated in trying to locate and understand the evidence. For the seasoned and novice practitioner, these new tools do make a significant difference in reducing fatigue and impatience, resulting in more complete and satisfactory examinations.</p></div></body></html>
