			<p>In the previous chapter, we talked about how to protect assets with controls that have been applied based on risk, but there is so much more that can be done. <em class="italic">What more can be done?</em>, you ask, bursting from sheer excitement. <em class="italic">Well…</em>, I reply, and softly smile to myself: <em class="italic">What if we just designed the systems with security in mind from the beginning?</em> Your face lights up, and the stars create tracers as the world whirls around us. </p>
			<p>No—but seriously, we should be designing our systems with security in mind from the beginning. That's what this chapter is about. By the way, I don't mean <em class="italic">design</em> the same way a man (who is still standing on a Segway scooter inside the elevator of your building with you) says that he <em class="italic">designed it himself</em>, his sunglasses still on even though you're indoors, thinking he's extremely cool. Yes, it's happened to me. I mean it in a way where we plan and <strong class="bold">threat-model</strong> the implementation and ensure that it is fit for purpose. </p>
			<p>Luckily, as you may already know from studying for your fancy cybersecurity certifications, that there are certain <strong class="bold">secure design principles</strong> that exist, allowing for us to utilize collective knowledge in order to improve the overall security posture of the system, without causing additional overhead. By the end of this chapter, you should be able to utilize these principles and select the appropriate controls to effectively manage secure information systems.</p>
			<p>Additionally, there are <strong class="bold">architectural vulnerabilities</strong> that can be avoided or mitigated against with controls, and so we will need to go over the best methods for that as well. My goal is for you to be comfortable in determining a system's security requirements in order to apply the appropriate controls. Beyond that, you will be aware of the available security capabilities for the particular information systems you are working with. </p>
			<p>Furthermore, there is the practice of selecting the appropriate controls. We briefly touched on this topic in <a href="B16611_02_Final_JM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor037"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>, <em class="italic">Protecting Security of Assets</em>, where I talked about <strong class="bold">defense in depth</strong> for various aspects of developing and running a web app, but I'll expand and try to help you be more comfortable with selecting and implementing controls to manage and mitigate against vulnerabilities in web-based systems, mobile systems, and embedded devices.  </p>
			<p>So, to summarize, in this chapter, we are looking at the following topics: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>Understanding the risks your organization faces</li>
				<li>Best practices in assessing and mitigating vulnerabilities</li>
				<li>Best practices in designing secure information systems</li>
			</ul>
			<p>All right—now that we've got our bulleted list in the introduction, I ask: <em class="italic">Are we ready to start?</em> Yes, we are ready to start. Let's begin where we should always begin, by trying to understand the risks. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-53"><a id="_idTextAnchor060"/>Understanding the risks your organization faces</h1>
			<p>In this section, we will focus our efforts on getting our heads around key concepts in the <strong class="bold">threats</strong>, <strong class="bold">vulnerabilities</strong>, and <strong class="bold">methods</strong> of exploiting <strong class="bold">information systems</strong>. This includes the types of systems we'll be dealing with, the threats that <strong class="bold">information security professionals</strong> are hired to <a id="_idIndexMarker256"/>protect those systems against, and the ways those threats exploit vulnerabilities in those systems. Only after we understand these key points can we move on to the protection section (that sounds like a <em class="italic">Schoolhouse Rock!</em> song, but do not worry—I'll keep this largely nonmusical).</p>
			<p>Something I would like <a id="_idIndexMarker257"/>to stress is that when we are designing a new system—whether this is web-based, mobile, embedded, or what have you—there are processes in place that ensure the security of our systems by design, and then there are mitigation controls that provide defense-in-depth in the event of the failure of those processes. </p>
			<p>First things first, let's talk about some key concepts around <em class="italic">threats</em> that exist. By understanding the threats that we are facing, we can start to apply that knowledge to understand the key <a id="_idIndexMarker258"/>concepts in the <strong class="bold">security models</strong>. So, <em class="italic">"Let's Talk About Threats, Baby"</em>. </p>
			<p>Hey—I said <em class="italic">largely nonmusical</em>, not <em class="italic">entirely nonmusical</em>.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-54"><a id="_idTextAnchor061"/>Threats, threat actors, and motivations</h2>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">threats</strong> against your <a id="_idIndexMarker259"/>organization can be varied, and understanding these <a id="_idIndexMarker260"/>is an extremely interesting topic to study. Most importantly, they are crucial to understand in order to fully and effectively protect your organization. Remember, we can't have a risk <a id="_idIndexMarker261"/>without a <strong class="bold">threat</strong> and <strong class="bold">threat actor</strong>, along with an asset and a vulnerability. </p>
			<p>As the world is changing to be <a id="_idIndexMarker262"/>more and more based in the digital realm, many threats to your organization will surface in the form of <strong class="bold">cybercrimes</strong>. Cybercrimes are <a id="_idIndexMarker263"/>no different from non-cyber crimes, in that there are various motivations that then lead to acts of crime (providing the threat actor has the capacity to have a motivation). The reason I use that stipulation is because there are threats that are environmental. No storm has ever had a motivation to destroy a server—that I'm fairly certain of. </p>
			<p>Now, these human motivations <a id="_idIndexMarker264"/>can vary from instance to instance and sometimes require some creative thinking and brainstorming to dream up. What I would like to do in this section is to stimulate that part of your brain, and get you thinking like a malicious actor. I want you to start to imagine how you would exploit your organization if you were to target it. What can you imagine people would want from it? What could people stand to gain, and who are those people? Which groups don't like your organization, and why is that? Maybe you work at the most benevolent organization that has ever existed, and nobody in their right mind would ever have any motivation to act against it. In that case, you still need to consider the insider risks of somebody accidently clicking a link or deleting a database. Not malicious, but still a threat actor, and still a threat that already has a certain level of access to your estate. <strong class="bold">Insider risks</strong> should always be <a id="_idIndexMarker265"/>considered when threat-modeling your organization, malicious and non-malicious.  </p>
			<p>As you might imagine, I can't really go into every possible motivation we might possibly see, but with that said, I can also throw some ideas your way.</p>
			<p>One "group" of motivations your organization may face comprises those that are not financial or political in nature. They could include, for example, <em class="italic">thrill-seeking</em>, <em class="italic">joy</em>, <em class="italic">data hoarding</em>, or <em class="italic">mastery</em>. These motivations are essentially based on the idea that the malicious actor enjoys the act of hacking, or the "paydirt" of the hack itself. Some individuals are more interested in if they can get in, or seeing what's inside, rather than how much they can earn by doing so. Maybe there are images or videos on a device or server that an attacker has an interest in seeing. Maybe your organization has a major security spokesperson with a million followers on Twitter who claims your product, a hardware Bitcoin wallet, is "unhackable". Researchers around the world are extremely interested in hacking things just to hack them, and especially if a major talking head makes a claim such as that. They might find your product doesn't wipe the <strong class="bold">random-access memory</strong> (<strong class="bold">RAM</strong>) clear <a id="_idIndexMarker266"/>after being rooted, meaning the secret phrase and salt are left in the RAM for extraction, and they might post it on Twitter. It brings them joy; it hones their craft; it helps them show their mastery while proving that talking head wrong. </p>
			<p>Additionally, there are thrill-seekers who just love the chase. It might seem strange, but a survey performed by <em class="italic">Thycotic Software</em> at <em class="italic">BlackHat USA</em> in 2014 found that 51% of the hackers surveyed said they were mostly motivated by fun or thrill-seeking. They could focus on your organization, just for the thrill of it, and the best you can do is to adequately protect your most important assets to the level of risk they pose. </p>
			<p>Another group of <a id="_idIndexMarker267"/>motivations worth discussing centers on politics and <strong class="bold">cyberwarfare</strong>, such as <em class="italic">hacktivism</em>, <em class="italic">propaganda</em>, and <em class="italic">sabotage</em>. In an era of online <a id="_idIndexMarker268"/>political discourse going mainstream, with major issues in current events, including a global pandemic, US election, and the UK exiting the EU (and those are just in the final couple months of 2020), we're facing a skyrocketing level of this type of motivation. <em class="italic">Hacktivism</em> and <em class="italic">sabotage</em> can be motivations for individuals or groups, all the way <a id="_idIndexMarker269"/>up to the <strong class="bold">state-sponsored actor</strong> level gaining access to (or destroying) accounts, systems, and assets they are at odds with. We've also got <em class="italic">propaganda</em> as a motivation, which can yet again be distributed by <strong class="bold">sole actors</strong> or groups, all <a id="_idIndexMarker270"/>the way to the largest imaginable force, which aims to gain control of legitimate channels to either filter or promote certain messages. </p>
			<p>Going further into the political sphere, looking at attacks at critical infrastructure by outside forces, we can interpret that the motivation for <em class="italic">destruction</em>, <em class="italic">control</em>, or <em class="italic">intimidation</em> exists. I am always reminded of the time the Ukrainian government, in the midst of a significant cyberattack, tweeted a "this is fine" meme in response, as seen here: </p>
			<p><a href="https://twitter.com/Ukraine/status/879706437169147906">https://twitter.com/Ukraine/status/879706437169147906</a> </p>
			<p>This is a screenshot of the tweet from Ukraine's government: </p>
			<div><div><img src="img/B16611_03_001.jpg" alt="Figure 3.1 – &quot;This Is Fine&quot; tweet from Ukraine's government&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.1 – "This Is Fine" tweet from Ukraine's government</p>
			<p>Why were several <a id="_idIndexMarker271"/>governmental agencies and private firms in Ukraine targeted? I can't be as confident as others have been to say <em class="italic">who</em> was targeting them, but the nature of the attacks implies the attacks fit into the destruction, control, or intimidation motivation group, or the hacktivism, propaganda, and sabotage motivation group, and was likely an act of cyberwar. </p>
			<p>Then, finally, we can look toward a motivation rooted in <em class="italic">monetary gain</em>. This could range from an individual finding a way to pilfer funds from a cryptocurrency exchange, or a mercenary hacking group spending time and effort in a heist situation, like an episode of <em class="italic">Mission: Impossible</em>. Furthermore, you have <strong class="bold">corporate espionage</strong>, such as what <em class="italic">The Ketchup Company</em> was <a id="_idIndexMarker272"/>starting to threat-model in <a href="B16611_01_Final_JM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor013"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a>, <em class="italic">InfoSec and Risk Management</em>, where a competitor tries to gain access to precious <strong class="bold">intellectual property</strong> your <a id="_idIndexMarker273"/>organization possesses. </p>
			<p>There are other competition-based motivations that could be considered, such as attempting to gain research information from nonprofits, for example. Honestly, the list could just keep going, but as I previously said, that's not the point of this section. My goal was to get your mind reeling and to get you to focus on who might target your organization, and why they might do so. In that, I can almost feel the gears in your head turning, so I think we're done here. </p>
			<p>Something you might hear <a id="_idIndexMarker274"/>about a lot lately is <strong class="bold">advanced persistent threats</strong>, or <strong class="bold">APTs</strong>. According to <em class="italic">NIST SP 800-39</em>, an APT is a threat actor that is both highly capable and highly motivated, with significant amounts of resources. This threat gains and maintains access within an organization's estate in order to exfiltrate information or <a id="_idIndexMarker275"/>manipulate operations for an extended period of time. The <strong class="bold">National Institute of Standards and Technology</strong> (<strong class="bold">NIST</strong>) says that they adapt to changes that are meant to mitigate against it. My point of view on APTs is pretty basic, in comparison to some of the things I've read <a id="_idIndexMarker276"/>on the topic. Most organizations are currently having difficulty protecting their assets against a sole 12-year-old who has watched some YouTube videos with titles along the lines of "<em class="italic">how to hack</em>", and even in those videos, the instructor will teach the viewer how to do the following: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>Gain access.</li>
				<li>Elevate privileges.</li>
				<li>Maintain access </li>
				<li>Exfiltrate information or manipulate operations.</li>
				<li>Remain undetected.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The only difference here from the YouTube <em class="italic">script-kiddie</em> and the APT is expertise, and funding. All of the other words NIST have used are just the basic steps any malicious outsider would take. I prefer to look at threats in the way we did in <a href="B16611_01_Final_JM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor013"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a>, <em class="italic">InfoSec and Risk Management</em>. In the case of APTs, we have <a id="_idIndexMarker277"/>malicious outsiders that are either <strong class="bold">group actors</strong> or <strong class="bold">state-sponsored actors</strong>, which means we need to consider <a id="_idIndexMarker278"/>that their ability to gain access and remain undetected is more sophisticated. Depending on your organization and its assets, this means that you might have a different level of risk that you will <a id="_idIndexMarker279"/>need to mitigate. </p>
			<p>One final remark that I would like to make is this: <em class="italic">Please</em> keep your <em class="italic">risk register</em> up to date with the appropriate threats and motivations! This isn't only for fun; this is to appropriately protect your organization. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-55"><a id="_idTextAnchor062"/>Vulnerabilities</h2>
			<p>Looking over what we've covered in <a href="B16611_01_Final_JM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor013"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a>, <em class="italic">InfoSec and Risk Management</em>, <a href="B16611_02_Final_JM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor037"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>, <em class="italic">Protecting the Security of Assets</em>, and so far in this chapter, we can say that I keep harping on about how "<em class="italic">You can't have a risk without an asset, a threat and threat actor, and a vulnerability</em>". What <em class="italic">is</em> a vulnerability, though? Have we gone into that? Have I taken for granted that you're a walking encyclopedia of InfoSec, a fountain of knowledge on every topic? </p>
			<p>The thing is that the <a id="_idIndexMarker280"/>list grows and grows when it comes to "types" of vulnerabilities if you get down to a granular level. <em class="italic">Meltdown</em>, <em class="italic">Thunderclap</em>, and <em class="italic">Spoiler</em> are some examples of recently discovered hardware security vulnerabilities, but explaining how those work will eat up my page count on this chapter, and there is simply far too much to cover already. Instead, let's take a couple steps up the ladder to view vulnerabilities from a higher level. <em class="italic">ISO/IEC 27005</em> guides us to classify vulnerabilities according to the asset class they are related to. This asset class could include <em class="italic">hardware, software, network, personnel, physical, and organizational</em> vulnerabilities, or maybe you have a different vision! Don't let <a id="_idIndexMarker281"/>me or the <strong class="bold">International Organization for Standardization</strong> (<strong class="bold">ISO</strong>) pigeonhole you with their strict Swiss guidelines—go on and fly! With that said, it <em class="italic">is</em> easier to just use their strict Swiss guidelines. </p>
			<p>You might be totally drawing a blank. "<em class="italic">What kind of vulnerabilities exist for each of these, Joseph?</em>", you might be asking. The problem is, it's such a tremendous topic, and part of the reason I am trying to encourage you to brainstorm and consider the possibilities yourself is due to the sheer volume of known vulnerabilities in the wild. If I go down the road of listing off vulnerabilities and explaining them, this book will end up being 1,500 pages long and less entertaining that it already is, which I would never want to inflict on anybody, especially somebody who is taking their time to read my ramblings. </p>
			<p>With that said, I <em class="italic">suppose </em>I could delve into a <a id="_idIndexMarker282"/>few examples of vulnerabilities and how to mitigate them. "<em class="italic">Vulnerabilities</em>" <em class="italic">is</em> the title of this section, after all. </p>
			<p>If we're looking at <em class="italic">hardware</em> assets, as an example, we can try to consider the various vulnerabilities that may exist, including the following:  </p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Physical threats</strong> such as <a id="_idIndexMarker283"/>humidity or dust; wear and tear causing failure; or over-heating all exist. A lack of controls such as ventilation, humidity control, cooling, lubrication, or quality control are all vulnerabilities that could all be exploited by a threat actor to cause a loss of availability by destroying, shutting down, or forcing the powering off of hardware. </p>
			<p>Remember—threat actors don't need to be malicious humans; they can be environmental, such as "friction". The effective implementation of the "lubrication" or "cooling" controls (combined with testing after implementation to ensure the control is effective) would lead to the mitigation of these vulnerabilities. </p>
			<p>When it comes to threats attempting to access storage—either hard drives or memory—you're faced with a few options. The lack of <em class="italic">encryption</em> when it comes to hard-drive storage could lead to a threat actor managing to access information by gaining physical access to a hard drive. By encrypting the hard drive, you're ensuring a level of defense-in-depth by ensuring that even if physical access were obtained, further exploitation would be required in order to gain access. </p>
			<p>By not protecting a system's memory from being both read and written to, you're looking at a risk of loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability. It's a highly utilized attack method, and as a result there are memory-protection controls in many modern architectures and operating systems that are occasionally broken and need to be mitigated through changes and updates to either the <em class="italic">kernel</em> or the <em class="italic">operating system</em>. </p>
			<p>Threats may attempt to read electrical signals for reverse-engineering or eavesdropping purposes. This could lead to a loss of confidentiality or integrity if they manage to gain access to protected resources through doing so. When we talk about vulnerabilities leading to the eavesdropping of electrical signals, we're starting to get pretty intense, and we should consider the likelihood of this type of attack. Which level of threat actors is likely to perform these <a id="_idIndexMarker284"/>types of attacks? The likelihood may be higher with more sophisticated threat actors, such as state-sponsored actors. With that said, there are mitigations against leaking emanations, such as shielding magnetic fields, filtering conducted signals, and masking space-radiated signals. </p>
			<p>Sometimes, vulnerabilities exist due to the basic function of the hardware and must be mitigate, for example, by preventing the possibility of physical access to the hardware through a <strong class="bold">security perimeter</strong>, although <a id="_idIndexMarker285"/>that is admittedly lacking defense-in-depth controls. </p>
			<p><em class="italic">Software</em> can have vulnerabilities exploited by a threat actor that does the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Finds a way to access more information than they should have access to, either through insecure code or a design flaw  </li>
				<li>Is able to use your software as a delivery mechanism for their malware, such as the <em class="italic">2020 SolarWinds hack</em>  </li>
				<li>Exploits the lack of an audit trail in your systems </li>
			</ul>
			<p>A lack of input sanitation can lead to information disclosure or your software being used to deliver malware <a id="_idIndexMarker286"/>through an <strong class="bold">injection attack</strong>. Mitigating this vulnerability is generally done through both static and dynamic code analysis, as well as automatically fuzzing your software with input that might lead to an injection, and also <em class="italic">penetration testing</em> of your software on a regular basis and upon significant change. </p>
			<p>The lack of logging in your estate could mean that a threat actor is able to maintain access, make changes, and exfiltrate <a id="_idIndexMarker287"/>data from your organization without being detected. Mitigating this with logging is mostly a <em class="italic">detective control</em>, but with the appropriate <strong class="bold">Security Information and Event Management</strong> (<strong class="bold">SIEM</strong>) configuration, and capable analysts in your <strong class="bold">Security Operations Center</strong> (<strong class="bold">SOC</strong>), you may <a id="_idIndexMarker288"/>be able to detect an ongoing attack and react to it in real time. Even better is adding automated responses into the mix, which isn't as far-fetched and difficult as it sounds, but does require quite a lot of understanding of your existing "normal" operation.  </p>
			<p><em class="italic">Networks</em> can have vulnerabilities exploited by a threat actor that does the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Eavesdrops on insufficiently protected communication </li>
				<li>Gains access through an insecure network architecture </li>
				<li>Causes a loss of <a id="_idIndexMarker289"/>availability through a <strong class="bold">Single Point of Failure</strong> (<strong class="bold">SPF</strong>)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>From a high-level view, <em class="italic">network security</em> is focused on ensuring the availability of network-accessible resources, along with the prevention of non-approved entities from access, and monitoring all <a id="_idIndexMarker290"/>network activity to ensure any infraction is dealt with appropriately. It's a deep topic that will require quite a bit more investigation than we currently have here, so I'm going to continue on with that topic in <a href="B16611_04_Final_JM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor075"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></a>, <em class="italic">Designing and Protecting Network Security</em>. </p>
			<p><em class="italic">Physical</em> sites are subject to vulnerabilities exploited by a threat actor that does the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Interrupts access, causing a loss of availability for your staff or systems</li>
				<li>Circumvents access control and gains unauthorized access to your physical estate</li>
			</ul>
			<p>While you are looking at physical sites and contemplating site security, aside from considering access control, turnstiles, mantraps, and biometrics, you should also consider the effects of faults in devices or controls. Also, what occurs in the event of a power blackout or power sag (as well as brownouts and spikes)? Consider the complexity that excessive noise may bring, and ensure you think about the requirements around heating, ventilation, humidity control, and cooling. As we mentioned in the first chapter, servers and water sources don't mix, but at the same time, you might need adequate fire protection. </p>
			<p>According to <em class="italic">NIST SP 800-30</em>, <em class="italic">organizational vulnerabilities</em> exist in the following forms: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>Governance structures</li>
				<li>Business processes</li>
				<li>Enterprise architecture </li>
				<li>Information security architecture</li>
				<li>Facilities</li>
				<li>Equipment </li>
				<li>Software development life-cycle processes</li>
				<li>Supply chain activities </li>
				<li>External service providers</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Essentially, threats may see a logical flaw in the way your organization runs things. They might notice that you don't properly <em class="italic">background check</em> your job applicants, or that you use external service <a id="_idIndexMarker291"/>providers but don't perform <em class="italic">due diligence</em> on them, and so the threat actors manage to exploit that to become embedded as an insider threat themselves. </p>
			<p>Furthermore, and by far the most likely threat in this section, threats may see a vulnerability in the lack of <em class="italic">security awareness</em> at your organization and, through manipulating or tricking personnel, manage to either gain access to your estate or have the personnel change or delete information for them, or disclose it to them. </p>
			<p>I'm sorry to mention it again, but <em class="italic">Mission: Impossible</em> is just way too relevant to not bring up twice: all of these generic examples I've given are fine, but I want to encourage you to think outside the box. Pretend you're a member of Ethan Hunt's <em class="italic">Impossible Missions Force</em>, and consider what you would look to exploit in order to gain access to your own estate, and how you may read or write information to achieve your ultimate goal of saving the world. If you haven't seen the films, I have no sympathy for you not getting this reference whatsoever; they're all brilliant (apart from the second one). </p>
			<p>To wrap up this section, I would like to say that it's important to consider every aspect of your business, and speak with relevant people who know the recorded processes and how real life differs from the documentation. A key question for yourself, moving forward, is: "<em class="italic">Do personnel do what they say, and say what they do?</em>". Policies and documented processes are only documentation, and if that documentation only exists to please auditors and security staff, then you are facing a huge gap between your <em class="italic">perceived security</em> and <em class="italic">actual security</em>. </p>
			<p>The brilliant thing is, if you handle things right and show yourself as approachable and able to make a positive change, you will encourage an open, transparent, and <a id="_idIndexMarker292"/>honest working environment where people aim to involve you to ensure they have an easy way to follow the rules, and let you know when it's not possible to do so. That is an information security professional's dream scenario right there. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-56"><a id="_idTextAnchor063"/>System exploitation methods </h2>
			<p>I'd like to look at some of the <a id="_idIndexMarker293"/>methods threat actors will use to exploit vulnerabilities in your estate. Yet again, there is a long list if we go deep and start <a id="_idIndexMarker294"/>picking out specific <strong class="bold">keyloggers</strong>, for example, so instead I'll go into the "category" for each exploitation method, and talk about each of them a little bit. </p>
			<p>First, since I just mentioned keyloggers, I'd like to look at <a id="_idIndexMarker295"/>types of <strong class="bold">malware</strong>. </p>
			<p>Malware is software used for nefarious purposes. It can include a wealth of different types of software, many of which have quite a lot to learn about individually, so I will split the malware section up. Something to keep in mind is that malware isn't always taking advantage of security vulnerabilities to be secretly installed on your endpoints or in your estate, which is what many definitions I've read have stated. In the late 1990s or early 2000s, I installed <em class="italic">BonzaiBuddy</em> by choice, which was a little purple gorilla in the bottom right of your screen that would sing you a song or search for things on the web. It was a marginally less <a id="_idIndexMarker296"/>lame version of Microsoft Clippy. It was later labeled by <em class="italic">Consumer Reports Web Watch</em> as <code>bonzi.com</code> without permission, which admittedly isn't very cool, and also tracked various information about the user, using that information to serve advertisements. All I can really say about that is: they were innovators! Now, almost every software does that, and it's seen as normal. </p>
			<p>Breaking down the malware category into subcategories, we can start to understand how they work and what a threat actor might use them for. </p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Viruses</strong> are an <a id="_idIndexMarker297"/>interesting concept in terms of cybersecurity. What is a virus? Can you name one? Looking through <em class="italic">Wikipedia</em>, you might see that the page for <em class="italic">Computer virus</em> claims that a virus self-replicates. You might think: "<em class="italic">I thought that was a</em> <em class="italic">worm</em>." On the <em class="italic">Wikipedia</em> page for <em class="italic">Malware</em>, it's stated that viruses are usually "<em class="italic">hidden within another seemingly innocuous program</em>", to which you might ask: "<em class="italic">Isn't that a</em> <em class="italic">Trojan Horse?</em>" </p>
			<p>What on earth is a virus, then? It seems like the community can't fully agree, but <em class="italic">Malwarebytes Labs</em> has attempted to define a computer virus once and for all as <em class="italic">"malware attached to another program (such as a document), which can replicate and spread after an initial execution on a target system where human interaction is required. Many viruses are harmful and can destroy data, slow down system resources, and log keystrokes."</em> </p>
			<p>Now, <em class="italic">that</em> makes sense. A virus <a id="_idIndexMarker298"/>requires human interaction and a host program, and attaches itself to other files (or replaces files fully with copies of itself). A <em class="italic">Trojan Horse</em> (or<em class="italic"> Trojan</em>) can be a virus; <em class="italic">ransomware </em>can be a virus; but <em class="italic">worms</em> aren't viruses. </p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Worms</strong> aren't <a id="_idIndexMarker299"/>that different from viruses, but just as I projected that you thought to yourself while reading the <em class="italic">Wikipedia</em> article for <em class="italic">Computer virus</em>, what differentiates a worm from a virus is that a worm does not require human interaction to spread across a system, network, estate, and so on. A worm <em class="italic">self-replicates</em>. </p>
			<p>The name <em class="italic">Trojan</em> is a reference to <em class="italic">The Aeneid</em>, by Virgil. In the poem, Odysseus the Greek thinks of a way to get his troops inside Troy, a highly secure walled city of the enemy. He says: "<em class="italic">My dudes, let's construct a gigantic horse sculpture out of wood, hide inside it, and leave it at their gate as an indication of surrender.</em>" At no point do any of the other Greeks call him out on it, which makes me feel like they were just afraid of what his reaction might be. What I'm saying is: I think Odysseus was a bit of a prima donna. Anyway, the Trojans find the sculpture at their gate and wheel it into their city, figuring "<em class="italic">Yeah, we could use a gigantic wooden horse, and this doesn't seem suspicious in any way whatsoever.</em>" It might shock you to hear, but that night, Odysseus's men jumped out from inside the horse, overthrowing the entire city. </p>
			<p>I'm sure you're glad that I went into the entire classical backstory for the term <em class="italic">Trojan</em>, because now you can very clearly understand that Trojans are just a way of getting malware into the walled city that is your organization's estate. When folks get the torrented, cracked version of the latest PC game, and the README tells them to turn off their antivirus when running the <em class="italic">keygen</em>, because it sets off <em class="italic">false positives</em>, and they do it? They might have just got Trojaned. The problem with knowing if the <code>keygen.exe</code> is an actual Trojan or just a false positive is difficult, because both use obfuscation to hide their algorithm and both will probably make some changes to your system, which automatically sets off antivirus software. </p>
			<p>Very similar in nature to the term <em class="italic">Trojan</em> is the term <em class="italic">backdoor</em>. Backdoors are deliberate (likely undocumented) points of entry into systems. These backdoors may allow for the delivery of <a id="_idIndexMarker300"/>malware, or other malicious activity by threat actors. The thing about backdoors is that they could be implemented into software or hardware by the manufacturer or any of their partners or suppliers that have had a part of the design and development stages. Potentially, intelligence agencies could request that manufacturers implement backdoors to allow for easy investigations on their part. Additionally, these backdoors can be created by other types of malware, and delivered via a Trojan. Are you still with me? If this section is pretty heavy, it's worth it—keep holding on. </p>
			<p>Another section of the overarching malware <a id="_idIndexMarker301"/>group is <strong class="bold">adware</strong>. Adware is often packaged with other software you install, but don't mistake it for a Trojan. It's not usually hiding; it could potentially show you a dialog in the installation process, which you haphazardly skip through like you have absolutely no time to do any reading whatsoever. </p>
			<p>Here's an example of the <strong class="bold">Search App by Ask</strong> being bundled with Java:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/B16611_03_002.jpg" alt="Figure 3.2 – Search App by Ask adware installation dialog&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.2 – Search App by Ask adware installation dialog</p>
			<p>It seems like it's <a id="_idIndexMarker302"/>just another innocuous page that you accept, because you want to get it over with and install Java already, but it's actually a <code>Ask.com</code>. The creators make money by serving you ads and gathering marketing data. </p>
			<p>OK—fine; your search engine has been changed in your browser—big deal. "<em class="italic">Why are we even worried about malware</em>?", people might ask. I would say the next few might change their tune. </p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Ransomware</strong> is a type of <a id="_idIndexMarker303"/>malware that prevents access to systems or files. It's an availability attack, usually through cryptography, and often acts as a worm, spreading through every compatible device on your network. Organizations affected by ransomware usually receive the <strong class="bold">payload</strong> in the form of a malicious link or an email with a malicious attachment. </p>
			<p>Once infected, a dialog will be shown on the <a id="_idIndexMarker304"/>affected computers that attempts to shake down the victims. "<em class="italic">We'll give you the decryption key if you send X Bitcoin to this address…</em>", or similar. </p>
			<p>Here's a screenshot of the Cryptolocker Bitcoin payment dialog: </p>
			<div><div><img src="img/B16611_03_003.jpg" alt="Figure 3.3 – CryptoLocker ransomware with Bitcoin payment option&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.3 – CryptoLocker ransomware with Bitcoin payment option</p>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Federal Bureau of Investigation</strong> (<strong class="bold">FBI</strong>) advises <a id="_idIndexMarker305"/>people to never pay a ransom, but as with everything in InfoSec, I would say that <em class="italic">it depends on the risk</em>. If you stand to lose more than the equivalent of the ransom value by not paying the ransom, then you might be compelled to pay it. The reason the FBI has taken that position is because it creates a market, and you can't be sure that the assailant will actually give you a decryption key.</p>
			<p>With that said, if word got <a id="_idIndexMarker306"/>out to other victims that even after payment no decryption occurs, it would ruin the revenue model of the campaign because other victims wouldn't be as likely to send the cryptocurrency to the perpetrator's addresses. As a result, it's in their best interest to decrypt your files when their victims pay, and we all know that business is booming. The <em class="italic">Cyber Threat Alliance</em> showed evidence in 2015 that the perpetrators behind a <em class="italic">CryptoWall 3.0</em> ransomware campaign had "<em class="italic">hundreds of thousands of dollars</em>" worth of Bitcoin received into their addresses, and things have only become more serious in the years since then. A cybercrime research organization called <em class="italic">Cybersecurity Ventures</em> has predicted that a ransomware attack is expected to affect a business every 11 seconds by the end of 2021, and that the annual damage will total 20 billion dollars.  </p>
			<p>Ransomware is scary, but <strong class="bold">spyware</strong> is creepy. Spyware is <a id="_idIndexMarker307"/>essentially a way for malicious actors to monitor your computer usage, harvest your passwords or payment information, and track what you visit online or the files you download. It can lead to identity theft or blackmail, and could have its own book dedicated to it. </p>
			<p>Generally, spyware will end up embedding itself to your operating system and might arrive as a Trojan, or even as something you agreed to install, similar to what we saw with adware. There's generally not going to be an "uninstall" program for spyware, and you likely won't know that it exists on <a id="_idIndexMarker308"/>your PC. It may be a <strong class="bold">keylogger</strong>, which is a system-monitoring solution that can log keystrokes, system credentials, and pretty much any other computer activity. Keyloggers can grab screenshots and transmit the information to a remote server through a covert channel. </p>
			<p>These types of malware generally <em class="italic">exploit</em> <strong class="bold">vulnerabilities</strong> in your device's software or hardware in order to get <strong class="bold">elevated privileges</strong>. New vulnerabilities for software and operating systems are found daily, and researchers might reach out to the creators of the software or hardware to <em class="italic">responsibly disclose</em> the vulnerability to them, in order to give them time to work on fixing the flaw and releasing a <strong class="bold">patch</strong> for the users currently affected by the flaw. Sometimes, the creator won't do anything or will legally threaten the researcher for that disclosure, and as a result the researcher may decide to release the information publicly, in order to try to force the hand of the creators. By drawing attention to an active vulnerability, and <a id="_idIndexMarker309"/>even providing a <strong class="bold">Proof of Concept</strong> (<strong class="bold">POC</strong>) for an <strong class="bold">exploit</strong>, it <a id="_idIndexMarker310"/>increases the likelihood that the vulnerability will be exploited and could result in bad press for the creators or a negative consumer response from the users. </p>
			<p>The other side of that story is that a researcher might find a new vulnerability or explore an existing vulnerability, and craft an exploit that they then sell to malicious actors, maybe as a suite of <a id="_idIndexMarker311"/>software called an <strong class="bold">exploit kit</strong>, which allows nontechnical malicious actors to perform their attack and spread malware or gain access.  </p>
			<p>You may have <a id="_idIndexMarker312"/>heard of <strong class="bold">rootkits</strong>—or, similarly, <strong class="bold">bootkits</strong>—which are fancy names for <a id="_idIndexMarker313"/>malware that either escalates the privilege of an unauthorized user (potentially all the way up to that of an <em class="italic">admin</em> (or "<em class="italic">root</em>") account) or hides the activities of another malware from detection, embedding themselves into the operating system of your device. These can help a <a id="_idIndexMarker314"/>malicious actor gain full access to a computer, allowing for attacks on confidentiality, integrity, and availability, or to utilize the compromised computer to perform attacks on other networks, computers, systems, and so on. </p>
			<p>A computer that is being used this <a id="_idIndexMarker315"/>way is called a <strong class="bold">zombie</strong>, and oftentimes you may find that this zombie is just <a id="_idIndexMarker316"/>one part of a much larger <strong class="bold">botnet</strong>, or collection of internet-connected devices that perform a synchronized attack. These botnets are <a id="_idIndexMarker317"/>especially useful in <strong class="bold">DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service)</strong> attacks, where the DoS sources are coming from a wealth of normally harmless <strong class="bold">Internet Protocol</strong> (<strong class="bold">IP</strong>) addresses <a id="_idIndexMarker318"/>with no pattern. As a result of their distributed nature, these attacks are difficult to create firewall rules for. </p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Logic bombs</strong> are a <a id="_idIndexMarker319"/>delivery mechanism that sets off malware activity once a set of conditions are met. Imagine, in a typical example, a systems administrator sets a <em class="italic">CronJob</em> that executes daily and asks them to enter a passphrase. Imagine the CronJob is set to encrypt all of the files in the network in the event that they are not performing their daily passphrase entry for 30 consecutive days, implying that they have been removed from the company. There are many other types of logic bombs, such as something as simple as: "<em class="italic">If this running process is closed, do this.</em>"  </p>
			<p>Something you've definitely read about in <a id="_idIndexMarker320"/>the news are <strong class="bold">zero days</strong>. These are simply vulnerabilities that were completely unknown to all aside from the malicious actor who is now exploiting that vulnerability. The term "<em class="italic">zero day</em>" is related to the fact that the vulnerability is being exploited with zero days for the developer to react and create a patch. </p>
			<p>So, in theory, we could say the following:</p>
			<p>"There's this <a id="_idIndexMarker321"/>new virus called "<em class="italic">TokTik</em>" that is <a id="_idIndexMarker322"/>very interesting. It is bundled with the latest version of <code>EssentialProgram</code> as a <strong class="bold">Trojan</strong>, initially just as <strong class="bold">browser-hijacking</strong> <strong class="bold">adware</strong>, but then as <strong class="bold">malware</strong> in the form of a <strong class="bold">keylogger</strong> <strong class="bold">spyware</strong> <strong class="bold">rootkit</strong> that spreads and executes a <strong class="bold">privilege escalation</strong> <strong class="bold">exploit</strong> to all the other devices on your network like a <strong class="bold">worm</strong>, adding each device as a <strong class="bold">zombie</strong> to their <strong class="bold">botnet</strong>, and performing <strong class="bold">DDoS</strong> attacks on businesses. If the rogue process is closed, another encrypts the hard drive and shows a dialog explaining the <strong class="bold">ransomware</strong> decryption process. <strong class="bold">Patches</strong> for operating systems are currently being developed, but many of the exploits were unknown and the <strong class="bold">vulnerabilities</strong> were never discovered until now, also known as <strong class="bold">zero days</strong>.</p>
			<p>However, if you <em class="italic">were</em> to say that, people might not talk to you anymore because that would be incredibly odd to hear. </p>
			<p>Beyond exploitation that <a id="_idIndexMarker323"/>occurs on your devices through viruses such as the previously mentioned malware examples, there exist other types of exploitation, such as the exploitation of organizational vulnerabilities (such as a lack of security consciousness), or exploiting software and web application vulnerabilities. </p>
			<p>What would this section be <a id="_idIndexMarker324"/>without discussing <strong class="bold">phishing</strong>? As a reminder, phishing is a method of exploitation through electronic communication whereby a malicious actor is disguised as a trusted party and <em class="italic">socially engineers</em> a user to help them in their goal by clicking a link, opening an attachment, or handing over information and secrets. It's the chosen exploitation mechanism for many threat actors because of the fact it doesn't require a technical vulnerability to be successful, but rather an organizational vulnerability. </p>
			<p>By emailing somebody in the company who might not be as <em class="italic">security-conscious</em> as a member of the InfoSec team, creating a little bit of <em class="italic">drama and urgency</em>, and guiding them toward executing a payload, the malicious actor is able to compromise your organization's system with ransomware or spyware, or initiate a bank transfer, all from their email app. It's cheap, it's fast, and it's effective. </p>
			<p>Additionally, something worth considering is the evolving landscape of our IT systems. For example, understanding cloud service types and deployment models, or web application security, are both extremely relevant for the current time. You see, as we have moved from on-premises servers and installing programs onto endpoints toward the <strong class="bold">cloud services</strong> model, software (and our overall estate) is increasingly accessed via a <strong class="bold">thin client</strong> (which usually means they're run in our preferred browsers), transitioning into what are known as <strong class="bold">web apps</strong>, delivered to users as a <strong class="bold">Software-as-a-Service</strong> (<strong class="bold">SaaS</strong>). <strong class="bold">SaaS</strong> applications <a id="_idIndexMarker325"/>usually have a monthly fee associated with them—that is, once the users require features that are offered beyond the barebones <em class="italic">free</em> tier. </p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Cloud service providers</strong>, such as <strong class="bold">Amazon Web Services</strong> (<strong class="bold">AWS</strong>) or Microsoft Azure, offer <strong class="bold">Platform-as-a-Service</strong> (<strong class="bold">PaaS</strong>) and <strong class="bold">Infrastructure-as-a-Service</strong> (<strong class="bold">IaaS</strong>) in a similar way, allowing for the metered usage of cloud computing power for a monthly fee. As time <a id="_idIndexMarker326"/>goes on, more and more of our estate is <a id="_idIndexMarker327"/>being outsourced and moved <a id="_idIndexMarker328"/>toward the cloud, either in the form of PaaS or IaaS. PaaS is usually offered as a <a id="_idIndexMarker329"/>simplified way to install and run an application without further configuration, allowing users to <em class="italic">outsource the responsibilities</em> of maintaining infrastructure and regular updates. IaaS, on the other hand, is a part of a server that exists in a data center in the region of your choice and, aside from the lack of physical interaction, the <em class="italic">responsibilities</em> for maintenance and updates to the system generally remain in the hands of the customer. </p>
			<p>The concept is <a id="_idIndexMarker330"/>referred to as the <strong class="bold">shared responsibility model</strong>, showing the differences in the various cloud solutions, and where separate responsibilities lie. </p>
			<p>Now, regardless of if you deploy your web app from your own <em class="italic">on-prem</em> servers, or on PaaS or IaaS, what we can see in web apps are certain types of vulnerabilities that allow malicious actors to compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of your app. The <strong class="bold">Open Web Application Security Project Top 10</strong> (<strong class="bold">OWASP Top 10</strong>) is a regularly updated list of the <a id="_idIndexMarker331"/>top 10 web application security risks, and it does a great job of explaining how each of the risks can be mitigated. In order to give <strong class="bold">application security</strong> the amount of attention it deserves, I will revisit it in <a href="B16611_08_Final_JM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor150"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></a>, <em class="italic">Improving the Security of Software</em>. Furthermore, the design, governance, and secure operation of your network and assets remain your responsibility, regardless of where the servers and computers currently physically "sit". We will <a id="_idIndexMarker332"/>explore network security in <a href="B16611_04_Final_JM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor075"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></a>, <em class="italic">Designing and Protecting Network Security</em>, and continue until <a href="B16611_07_Final_JM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor123"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></a>, <em class="italic">Owning Security Operations</em>.</p>
			<p>This moves us on to the next step, where we'll look at best practices in assessing and mitigating vulnerabilities.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-57"><a id="_idTextAnchor064"/>Best practices in assessing and mitigating vulnerabilities</h1>
			<p>For some of the vulnerability <a id="_idIndexMarker333"/>concepts we've gone through earlier in this chapter, I've included ways to mitigate against those vulnerabilities. None of those mitigations takes into consideration your own organization, its threats, the value of the assets, or the likelihood of exploitation. I've just essentially listed off ways you might have seen other organizations mitigate against those risks, and potentially a few good ideas came to you that way. </p>
			<p>In this section, I would like to continue in that fashion, but I first want to stress how important it is to apply the necessary amount of mitigations in order to reduce down to an <em class="italic">acceptable level</em>. That's the name of the game here! Save yourself the money and headaches involved with making a system completely risk-proof when it doesn't face any threats or isn't valuable to you or a threat actor. </p>
			<p>With that said, I can get back into how we can secure our systems and choose appropriate controls. </p>
			<p>We've already gone into how to protect the different classes of ISO-defined information assets, which were hardware, software, networks, physical, and organizational. I just want to take a second to briefly revisit each, in case there's more to be said.  </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-58"><a id="_idTextAnchor065"/>Hardware security</h2>
			<p>When we were reviewing <a id="_idIndexMarker334"/>hardware assets, we talked about ventilation, humidity control, cooling, lubrication, or quality-control as mitigations from a loss of availability realized <a id="_idIndexMarker335"/>through the destruction or powering off of hardware. We reviewed that threat actors don't need to be malicious humans; they can be environmental, such as "friction". Something I mentioned in that section that I would like to bring up again is <strong class="bold">testing</strong> after the implementation of a security control, in order to ensure the control is effective. </p>
			<p>Throughout your career as an InfoSec professional, you want to ensure that after the appropriate controls are chosen and implemented, you first "test" the system for vulnerabilities yourself and patch any holes you find. Then (if the asset is valuable enough to justify it, remember) you have an <a id="_idIndexMarker336"/>external third party "test" it. This is often called <strong class="bold">penetration testing</strong> (<em class="italic">pentest</em>) or <strong class="bold">red teaming</strong>, depending on the <a id="_idIndexMarker337"/>complexity of the assessment. You can also perform automated scans, but the effectiveness of those scans have yet to supersede having an actual <em class="italic">pentest</em>, where you pay an expert hacker to actually break into your system. It's a beautiful and heartbreaking method of checking the effectiveness of your controls. You will end up thinking to yourself a few things. First, you will think: "I can't believe I missed that!", but then, you'll think: "Thank goodness I paid one of the good guys to find it first." </p>
			<p>You'll take their report, implement the appropriate controls to mitigate against their findings, and ask them to retest in order to ensure your new controls are effective. It's an integral part of the job and provides major firepower in management-level or board-level presentations when you're talking about the likelihood aspect of your risks. You now have an example of an actual scenario where somebody broke into your system, and you now have the attention of the people who control the funds. </p>
			<p>We also previously reviewed protecting access to storage, either through hard drives or memory. For memory, we talked about memory-protection controls in system architectures and operating systems, which are occasionally broken and need to be mitigated through changes to either the <em class="italic">kernel</em> or the <em class="italic">operating system</em>. </p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Data execution prevention</strong> is an <a id="_idIndexMarker338"/>operating system protection for memory that designates sections of memory as non-executable. Making this distinction prevents code from being run from those sections by giving a memory-access-violation exception, terminating the process, and preventing from buffer overflows.</p>
			<p>For hard drives, I briefly mentioned that by encrypting the hard drive you're ensuring a level of defense-in-depth, by ensuring that even if physical access were obtained, further exploitation would be required in order to gain access. </p>
			<p>One other aspect of <a id="_idIndexMarker339"/>encryption that would be useful to mention in the hardware security topic of this section is a <strong class="bold">Trusted Platform Module</strong>, or <strong class="bold">TPM</strong>. TPMs are <a id="_idIndexMarker340"/>dedicated microcontrollers that, with integrated cryptographic keys, help to secure hardware. They generally include a <strong class="bold">random number generator</strong> (<strong class="bold">RNG</strong>), which is <a id="_idIndexMarker341"/>hardware-based; the ability to generate cryptographic keys; and the ability to create a <strong class="bold">hash</strong> of the configuration and hardware in the system for integrity purposes. When you use <em class="italic">BitLocker</em> to encrypt your Windows 10 laptop, the best way to do so is by using the laptop's TPM, which also allows for <em class="italic">integrity checks</em> at boot time. </p>
			<p>The concept of a <strong class="bold">trusted computing base</strong> or <strong class="bold">TCB</strong> has <a id="_idIndexMarker342"/>roots in risk management, where the TCB is determined as all of the system components that are high-impact in terms of security. If a vulnerability is found in the TCB, the risk of <a id="_idIndexMarker343"/>compromise to the entire system is higher. Determining your TCB may be something you do in the risk management process, if you determine that it's important. You can enforce that every system in your TCB has a TPM to verify integrity.</p>
			<p>Additionally, operating systems utilize an architectural concept of a <strong class="bold">reference monitor</strong>, which <a id="_idIndexMarker344"/>enforces an access control policy over users and processes attempting to read and write to a system. The design paradigm utilizes an acronym of <strong class="bold">NEAT</strong>, standing for the following: </p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Non-bypassable</strong>, which means an attacker can't get around the reference monitor and read/write to a system without permission</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Evaluable</strong>, which means the results and performance should be able to be analyzed</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Always invoked</strong>, meaning the mechanism should always be available, and always utilized for all security-sensitive operations  </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Tamper-proof</strong>, meaning the <a id="_idIndexMarker345"/>mechanism cannot be changed to circumvent the control </li>
			</ul>
			<p>All of these ideologies are very valuable in your own decisions, moving forward. I don't want you to look at built-in controls as something that are "handled", or not relevant to your role. A lot of the controls already available contain suggestions regarding how you could design <em class="italic">anything</em> securely, from your entire system down to the most minute function. We talked about <a id="_idIndexMarker346"/>evaluation earlier when we were talking about penetration testing. We talked about tamper proofing in the TPM's integrity checks. Looking at <a id="_idIndexMarker347"/>how these paradigms work from a micro and macro scale are important in selecting the appropriate controls for protecting against attacks on confidentiality, integrity, and availability. </p>
			<p>We then moved on to protecting electrical signals from reverse-engineering and eavesdropping. We looked at mitigations against leaking emanations, such as shielding magnetic fields, filtering conducted signals, and masking space-radiated signals. We also briefly went over the restriction of physical access to the hardware, and also how that lacks defense-in-depth. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-59"><a id="_idTextAnchor066"/>Software security</h2>
			<p>We then moved on to software, which can <a id="_idIndexMarker348"/>have vulnerabilities such as the <a id="_idIndexMarker349"/>following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Giving users access to more information than they should have access to, either through insecure code or a design flaw  </li>
				<li>Being able to act as a delivery mechanism for malware  </li>
				<li>The lack of an audit trail, leading to maintained access, exfiltrated data, and unseen changes</li>
			</ul>
			<p>I will cover more on these vulnerabilities in <a href="B16611_08_Final_JM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor150"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></a>, <em class="italic">Improving the Security of Software</em>, but for right now we can say that mitigating these vulnerabilities is generally done through code reviews, separation of duties, static and dynamic code analysis tools, and also the <em class="italic">penetration testing</em> of your software on a regular basis, and upon significant change. The lack of an audit trail can be mitigated by implementing one! By utilizing logging solutions, you are able to track software and network-based activities, such as access, changes, and traffic leaving your organization. With SIEM combined with analysts in a SOC, organizations <a id="_idIndexMarker350"/>detect ongoing attacks in real time and potentially react to them manually or automatically. Practicing and <a id="_idIndexMarker351"/>testing this control is part of a red team, where the <a id="_idIndexMarker352"/>defending side acts as the <strong class="bold">Blue Team</strong>. Testing the Blue Team is highly critical for some organizations and, yet again, it's up to you to decide if that's in line with the level of risk your organization faces. I cover more on security testing in <a href="B16611_06_Final_JM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor112"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>,<em class="italic"> Designing and Managing Security Testing Processes</em>.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-60"><a id="_idTextAnchor067"/>Network security</h2>
			<p>We then moved on and <a id="_idIndexMarker353"/>talked about how <em class="italic">networks</em> face vulnerabilities that are exploited by a threat actor either through eavesdropping on insufficiently protected <a id="_idIndexMarker354"/>communication or by gaining access through insecure network architecture, or by causing a loss of availability. From a very high level, to control those, we're looking at the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Encryption to protect communication </li>
				<li>Access control to control who has access to what, for how long </li>
				<li>Vulnerability management to find and patch vulnerabilities in all network architecture, along with the other devices in your estate </li>
				<li>Redundancy to protect against a loss of availability, (hopefully) protecting against <em class="italic">single points of failure</em> </li>
			</ul>
			<p>We are going to delve deeper into this topic in <a href="B16611_04_Final_JM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor075"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></a>, <em class="italic">Designing and Protecting Network Security</em>, so I will save further explanation on how to do so for that chapter instead.  </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-61"><a id="_idTextAnchor068"/>Physical security</h2>
			<p><em class="italic">Physical </em>sites have vulnerabilities which can <a id="_idIndexMarker355"/>lead to either loss of availability for your staff or systems, or circumvention of access control. To prevent from unauthorized <a id="_idIndexMarker356"/>access to your physical estate, we should consider a <em class="italic">defense in depth</em> approach. </p>
			<p>Turnstiles and mantraps are entry controls, mitigating from a threat actor <em class="italic">piggybacking</em> the entry credentials of another person or <em class="italic">tailgating</em> behind somebody else, catching the door. </p>
			<p>Biometric locks, such as a fingerprint scanner, ensure the authorized person is in fact the authorized person, not just somebody with a key or a badge. Sometimes, they aren't effective controls, either because they <a id="_idIndexMarker357"/>respond with too many <strong class="bold">false negatives</strong>, locking legitimate people out, or give <a id="_idIndexMarker358"/>out too many <strong class="bold">false positives</strong>, giving the wrong people access. These are worth considering when selecting this control, and questions should be asked for each <a id="_idIndexMarker359"/>use case surrounding: "Which is worse, the wrong person getting in, or the right person not being able to?" </p>
			<p>On the topic of selecting the appropriate controls for your organization and its systems, let's move on to the next section. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-62"><a id="_idTextAnchor069"/>Selecting appropriate controls/defense against the dark arts</h2>
			<p>If we're starting by <a id="_idIndexMarker360"/>discussing the time-based control category, I'm sure you're aware of the difference between <strong class="bold">preventative controls</strong> and <strong class="bold">detective controls</strong>: they're <a id="_idIndexMarker361"/>found in the names. The first helps to prevent attacks from being successful in the future, and the second helps to <a id="_idIndexMarker362"/>alert systems and personnel while an attack is in progress. <strong class="bold">Corrective controls</strong> help to <a id="_idIndexMarker363"/>restore systems and reduce the effects of a <em class="italic">breach</em>. </p>
			<p>When we're talking about the type of control <a id="_idIndexMarker364"/>without time being a factor, we've already gone into some <a id="_idIndexMarker365"/>examples of <a id="_idIndexMarker366"/>each: <strong class="bold">physical controls</strong>, <strong class="bold">procedural controls</strong>, and <strong class="bold">technical controls</strong>. We mentioned guards, biometrics readers, turnstiles, and so on. Additionally, <strong class="bold">closed-circuit television</strong> (<strong class="bold">CCTV</strong>), motion sensors, fences, and so on are also considered <a id="_idIndexMarker367"/>physical controls. <strong class="bold">Procedural controls</strong> (or <em class="italic">administrative controls</em>) are pretty self-explanatory as well, and include processes (or administration) such as training and awareness; risk management processes; recruitment policies; disaster recovery plans; and so on. You have been given a load of technical control examples in this chapter so far, such as encryption, authentication, TPMs, data execution <a id="_idIndexMarker368"/>prevention, and so on. A couple of examples of <strong class="bold">legal and regulatory controls</strong> (also known as <em class="italic">compliance controls</em>) are the various privacy laws and information security standards that currently exist, sometimes carrying fines for <a id="_idIndexMarker369"/>non-compliance (such as the <strong class="bold">General Data Protection Regulation</strong> (<strong class="bold">GDPR</strong>)). </p>
			<p>The selection of controls in order to adequately defend your organization's assets against the threats it faces should be based on a combination of the following two factors:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The level of risk that asset faces, based on the likelihood of a threat exploiting a vulnerability, and the impact of that exploitation</li>
				<li>Your knowledge surrounding the effective application of various controls, depending on the threat vectors for that asset </li>
			</ul>
			<p>We want to apply the <a id="_idIndexMarker370"/>required controls for the required use cases, and ensure that we've covering all threat vectors that are relevant to that specific asset and threat actor, but not wasting our time on applying controls that aren't relevant. If there is no need for a control to exist, then it's important to remember that complexity is the enemy of security, and reconsider increasing levels of complexity for no benefit in terms of reducing the level of risk. </p>
			<p>Now that we've covered how to assess and mitigate vulnerabilities in hardware, software, network, and physical systems, let's move on to the next topic, and focus on designing secure information systems. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-63"><a id="_idTextAnchor070"/>Best practices in designing secure information systems</h1>
			<p>With all of this knowledge that <a id="_idIndexMarker371"/>we just merely glossed over so far in this chapter (and which I'm fairly certain you already had) in regard to all of the threats, threat actors, motivations, vulnerabilities, and the methods for system exploitation that exist, the clear question that remains unanswered is: <em class="italic">"How can I design secure information systems?"</em></p>
			<p>Finally! We're going to talk about how to design a secure information system, and you're going to learn all of the ins and outs of how to do that in the best possible way. I'm really excited, but perhaps not for the reason you might think. You see, in learning about the threats, the devices and assets, and the methods, I truly believe you've already activated many of the thought processes required and have asked yourself many of the questions required to design a more secure system. </p>
			<p>Many guidelines exist, but since this book is (trying to) focus on the best practices, I'm going to go over some issues that we've covered, and simplify the process of designing a secure system for you.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-64"><a id="_idTextAnchor071"/>Secure design principles</h2>
			<p>When we're looking at the <a id="_idIndexMarker372"/>appropriate ways to design our systems and the way they interact with each other, and users, we want to consider the principles of <strong class="bold">least privilege</strong> and <strong class="bold">Zero Trust</strong>, and the ideologies behind the <strong class="bold">secure by default</strong> and <strong class="bold">secure by design</strong> principles.</p>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">principle of least privilege</strong> is focused on ensuring that <a id="_idIndexMarker373"/>any access to a system resource must only be for the intended purposes, for the shortest amount of time possible. If a user or asset isn't meant to perform an action then it shouldn't ever be given the ability to do so, and so rights can be reduced down to the least-possible amount. </p>
			<p>For an example, if you have a website being served to the internet via web server software that is running as the admin user, compromise of that web server could lead to critical or sensitive files in the network being read or deleted by a malicious actor. Does that web server asset need the ability to delete files? Does it need access to all of the sensitive files? No, so reduce the privileges down to the least amount possible. </p>
			<p>As another example, if a user (or process) needs to read the files in a certain system folder, that user (or process) should only be given read privileges, not write privileges. Additionally, they should only be able to access the files for reading purposes for the period of time in which it is required. This is <a id="_idIndexMarker374"/>aided by <strong class="bold">Just-In-Time access</strong>, a methodology that enforces the least-privilege principle in access to your systems. It allows for access to requested resources, by provisioning an ephemeral one-time-use account that is deprovisioned immediately after the task is complete. This is granted (or not granted) based on risk indicators, such as "Is this a normal activity for this user?", or "Does this <a id="_idIndexMarker375"/>user have <strong class="bold">multi-factor authentication</strong> (<strong class="bold">MFA</strong>) enabled?", among many other things. Gone are the days when users are always "admins". The reason for this is simple: by reducing down to <a id="_idIndexMarker376"/>least-privilege and leveraging Just-In-Time access, we diminish the impact of a compromised account and decrease the likelihood of compromise through elevation of privileges.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Zero Trust</strong> is a modern <a id="_idIndexMarker377"/>security concept focused on a few ideologies. These include the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Using the principle of least privilege across your system(s) through Just-In-Time and Just-Enough access, and encrypting and protecting your data at rest to prevent unauthorized access. </li>
				<li>Always verifying all activities, by authenticating and authorizing based on all of those datapoints we began to mention when we were talking about risk indicators for Just-In-Time access, which include geolocation, device metrics, anomaly detection, and so on. </li>
				<li>Assuming breach, the major idea behind Zero Trust. You restrict any lateral movements by segmenting all assets through the methods in the preceding two bullets; you prevent any eavesdropping by encrypting end to end; you detect active threats through logging and monitoring; and you continually improve by updating, patching, and evaluating the implementation of the system.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Zero Trust sounds pretty logical at this stage, after understanding the threats, vulnerabilities, and methodologies currently seen in the world, but as I said, it's a pretty new ideology that is getting more and more traction as time goes on, thankfully. Further reading can be found in <em class="italic">NIST SP 800-207</em>, if you want to have a bunch of fun reading a NIST Special Publication. </p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Secure by design</strong> is very much the <a id="_idIndexMarker378"/>end goal of what we're trying to achieve in all of our systems and is the main topic of this chapter. It's the principle of building systems to be secure from the beginning. When creating a secure-by-design system, we must first consider the threats, the assets, and the vulnerabilities that are inherently present, and then we must consider all of the security principles and controls we've gone into, and more! </p>
			<p>I just want to take this <a id="_idIndexMarker379"/>moment to harp on at you that there is a ton of further investigation and learning to do after this. The continual improvement that we're going to be putting our processes and systems through will also be applied to you and your knowledge. As threats emerge and change and new technologies are developed, new vulnerabilities and mitigation controls will crop up too, and it's your responsibility to investigate all of them. I'm sorry that I can't go into all of them in this book, but what I hope I have done is help you in analyzing controls and ensuring you are selecting the appropriate mitigations for each of your risks. </p>
			<p>Getting back on track, among these principles and controls, the best choices are selected strategically by understanding the risks implemented and enforced by the architecture design to ensure confidentiality, integrity, availability, and non-repudiation for the entire system. This is always <a id="_idIndexMarker380"/>done by avoiding <strong class="bold">security through obscurity</strong>, which will eventually fail at the hands of an insider risk or knowledgeable threat actor. We should be open about the design of the system because any knowledge of how the system is designed shouldn't compromise its security, because it is designed in a way that is secure and beyond any knowledge. </p>
			<p>When we're looking at hackers, I would like to bring up a few bullet points I mentioned earlier when I was talking about the differences between a script-kiddie and an APT. I mentioned the following sequence for hacking: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>Gain access.</li>
				<li>Elevate privileges.</li>
				<li>Maintain access.</li>
				<li>Exfiltrate information or manipulate operations.</li>
				<li>Remain undetected.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>When designing your system, you will want to consider how to prevent each of these steps from happening. How can you ensure a malicious actor isn't able to gain access? How do malicious actors <a id="_idIndexMarker381"/>elevate privileges or move laterally in your estate? How are they able to maintain access? Are you able to detect when data is exfiltrated or operations are manipulated? Many of the principles we've gone into so far are applicable here, and you can bolster your system through implementing a set of defense-in-depth controls for each. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-65"><a id="_idTextAnchor072"/>Well-known controls and their mitigations</h2>
			<p>We should probably <a id="_idIndexMarker382"/>turn the way we are looking at this around, and start talking about well-known controls and which risks they might mitigate. That could help things click, and help us analyze our existing systems. </p>
			<p>For example, <strong class="bold">backups</strong> prevent availability and integrity risks. If your systems have been affected by ransomware, providing you have a recent backup that hasn't been affected, then you can always restore your systems with that data, causing a minimized amount of disruption and loss. Backups aren't the only control for <strong class="bold">ransomware</strong>, of course. We said that ransomware often spreads as a worm and uses elevated privileges to encrypt the data in your estate, so by following the <strong class="bold">principle of least privilege</strong>, you reduce the likelihood that a compromised account is able to modify the data. By updating your systems, you reduce the likelihood that a piece of <strong class="bold">malware</strong> is able to exploit a known vulnerability in your systems. By having <strong class="bold">antivirus</strong> or <strong class="bold">advanced threat-protection</strong> software installed on all of your compatible systems, you apply a <em class="italic">detective control</em> to prevent the spread of that malware, and mitigate against the loss. </p>
			<p>Reducing privileges can also help <a id="_idIndexMarker383"/>protect against <strong class="bold">logic bombs</strong> and insider threats from exfiltrating data such as intellectual property. </p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Antivirus software</strong> helps protect <a id="_idIndexMarker384"/>against known threats, usually through signature-based detection, and can help detect and remove the threats I mentioned earlier under the malware category, such as <strong class="bold">spyware</strong>, <strong class="bold">adware</strong>, <strong class="bold">rootkits</strong>, and <strong class="bold">bootkits</strong>. </p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Vulnerability management</strong> and <strong class="bold">patching</strong> can ensure <a id="_idIndexMarker385"/>that various <a id="_idIndexMarker386"/>known exploits aren't able to be used in your estate, because the manufacturer of the product has released an update to mitigate or remove the risk of compromise. There <a id="_idIndexMarker387"/>are always articles and news stories about <strong class="bold">zero days</strong>, but in reality, most organizations are running outdated software with publicly available exploits. The "Kiss principle" is relevant here. Focus on risk, and with a high likelihood (such as if the exploit is currently available on GitHub) comes elevated risk. I will delve deeper into vulnerability management and patching in <a href="B16611_07_Final_JM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor123"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></a>, <em class="italic">Owning Security Operations</em>.<em class="italic"> </em></p>
			<p>When it comes to physical security, we can mention <strong class="bold">uninterruptable power supplies</strong> (<strong class="bold">UPS</strong>) for <a id="_idIndexMarker388"/>availability during blackouts, brownouts, and power sag. We <a id="_idIndexMarker389"/>can consider <strong class="bold">surge protection</strong> for spikes. </p>
			<p>We already mentioned <strong class="bold">heating</strong>, <strong class="bold">ventilation</strong>, <strong class="bold">humidity control</strong>, and <strong class="bold">cooling</strong> as mitigation tactics from physical threats, as well as avoiding the combination of water sources and your information systems. <strong class="bold">Fire protection</strong> is also a <a id="_idIndexMarker390"/>topic for concern. Human life is the most important consideration (although from what I've seen, I'm not sure 100% of organizations agree!). Fire <a id="_idIndexMarker391"/>protection is a way to protect employees from harm and is potentially a compliance requirement, depending on your region or operations. </p>
			<p>The main thing I'd like to raise when <a id="_idIndexMarker392"/>considering physical security is <strong class="bold">outsourcing</strong>. Many of the physical security requirements we've covered are as a result of having servers and information systems in an office location, and by outsourcing as many of those systems possible by utilizing the cloud and <strong class="bold">shared responsibility model</strong>, you are able to <a id="_idIndexMarker393"/>transfer the risk for physical security to a company such as Microsoft or Amazon, who have data centers with incredible physical security controls, appropriate for various levels of industrial, military, and governmental activities. </p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Background checks</strong> and <strong class="bold">due diligence</strong> for new hires and third-party vendors are preventative controls that protect from threats exploiting a gap in your organizational processes. Furthermore, we could look at <strong class="bold">security awareness training</strong> and <strong class="bold">phishing exercises</strong> as mitigation against organizational threats. By training your employees and creating an environment of <em class="italic">security-consciousness</em>, you are able to reduce the risk of a successful phishing attack or negligent practices negatively affecting your organization's operations.</p>
			<p>By utilizing appropriate <strong class="bold">hardware and software firewalls</strong>, <strong class="bold">network topologies</strong>, and <strong class="bold">cloud services</strong>, you are able to reduce the likelihood of a DoS attack (or even a DDoS attack) from taking your business offline, or increasing your monthly cloud service bill to a point where it can't be paid for. </p>
			<p>By performing active testing on all of your assets, including performing <strong class="bold">web application testing</strong> against <a id="_idIndexMarker394"/>your web apps, taking into consideration the <strong class="bold">OWASP Top 10</strong>, you are <a id="_idIndexMarker395"/>able to get visibility on present vulnerabilities, as well as prevent from new vulnerabilities being added to your existing apps and software solutions. By <a id="_idIndexMarker396"/>allowing a third-party <strong class="bold">penetration test</strong> on your environment, you allow for the good guys to find holes that the <a id="_idIndexMarker397"/>bad guys would have found eventually, ultimately a <strong class="bold">preventative control</strong> for <a id="_idIndexMarker398"/>your organization. Did your systems notice the pentest? If not, then you don't have the appropriate level of <a id="_idIndexMarker399"/>detective controls such as <strong class="bold">logging</strong> combined <a id="_idIndexMarker400"/>with <strong class="bold">SIEM</strong> and a <strong class="bold">SOC</strong>, which is another <a id="_idIndexMarker401"/>control that can be outsourced to specialty firms with the ability to perform the appropriate analysis on the activity in your estate. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-66"><a id="_idTextAnchor073"/>Considering alternative devices</h2>
			<p>When it comes to alternative <a id="_idIndexMarker402"/>devices such as mobile, <strong class="bold">Internet of Things</strong> (<strong class="bold">IoT</strong>), or <strong class="bold">supervisory control and data acquisition</strong> (<strong class="bold">SCADA</strong>), different aspects <a id="_idIndexMarker403"/>will need to be considered, because of <a id="_idIndexMarker404"/>the nature of each. </p>
			<p>Starting with <strong class="bold">mobile</strong>—or, specifically, <em class="italic">mobile phones</em>—let's consider what we're looking at here: We have a device that people take with them everywhere. These devices may store your organization's sensitive data, or have access to your estate… and something that people do on occasion is forget them somewhere. You've given up <strong class="bold">physical access</strong>, so what is it exactly you need to do to ensure you're only paying to replace the phone, and haven't (for instance) given up your intellectual property to a competitor? Well, earlier in this chapter, we already covered the idea of encrypting your hard drives to prevent physical access leading to compromise, and once you encrypt your device, you probably will have put a lock screen on that is password-protected… but as this device moves around, and you might not know the last place you left it, you might want to consider the additional feature of the <strong class="bold">Global Positioning System</strong> (<strong class="bold">GPS</strong>) <strong class="bold">Find My Phone</strong> or <strong class="bold">Remote</strong> <strong class="bold">wipe</strong> <a id="_idIndexMarker405"/>functions. Additionally, if this device is owned by the user but still accesses your resources, you can have a <a id="_idIndexMarker406"/>security baseline that is checked before it is given access your estate. This checks if the latest patches have been applied, and usually requires some sort of virus-protection solution. </p>
			<p>When we're talking about IoT or we're looking at devices that usually have access to the outside world through the internet, which may be created by a manufacturer who doesn't specialize in making hardware or software, but rather lightbulbs or stereo systems or vacuum cleaners or security cameras, and might not regularly patch reported vulnerabilities. It sounds like a bit of a nightmare for your estate, but don't worry—there are solutions to that. First, create an IoT network for all that stuff. Anything falling under the IoT device category gets put in that segregated sandbox, mitigating against the impact of a vulnerability that is exploitable over the web and <a id="_idIndexMarker407"/>allows access into the network (also known as <strong class="bold">remote-access vulnerabilities</strong>). Yes, it's happened… IoT lightbulbs have given remote access into corporate networks. It actually happened all the time, and it's pretty embarrassing. </p>
			<p>Other mitigations for defense-in-depth purposes include selecting IoT products that have a good track record for releasing patches, applying the latest said patches, restricting privileges down to the least <a id="_idIndexMarker408"/>amount possible while retaining functionality (the <strong class="bold">least-privilege</strong> principle), and changing default passwords that are easily guessable or (because they're the same for every device) are found online.</p>
			<p><code>Shodan.io</code>, the search engine for IoT. If you haven't looked at <em class="italic">Shodan.io</em>, you definitely should do that (as soon as you finish the <em class="italic">Mission: Impossible</em> films); it's legitimately cool. You get a <a id="_idIndexMarker412"/>world map view, with red dots on the map that show various internet-connected devices, their IP addresses and open ports, and even a screenshot of the web page that you would see if you followed the rabbit hole and accessed the device over the internet in your browser. Awesome, right? Except, sometimes, there's a <em class="italic">wind turbine</em> or <em class="italic">electricity plant</em> that is exposed to the internet with no mitigations. A malicious actor could just turn everything off, or on, or do pretty much anything an authorized user could do! </p>
			<p>In order to mitigate against the risk of high-impact functionality combined with outdated and insecure protocols, weak (or lack of) authentication, and ineffective security-through-obscurity controls, you should consider a few things. The first thing that you need to do is to find all of the connections and create a diagram of your SCADA networks. Then, if you can, <strong class="bold">airgap</strong> as many of these devices as possible. No internet access; separate network; no connection to the outside world. That doesn't really protect you from all of the threats, however. Strengthen the remaining connections in the network with authentication and authorization controls; install updates if they exist; disable unnecessary services that increase your <strong class="bold">attack surface</strong>; perform <strong class="bold">penetration tests</strong> and <strong class="bold">red teams</strong>; and make sure to always consider SCADA in your risk management processes. </p>
			<p>The thing is, ideally, this is how you should be treating everything in your estate! Most of the best practices for securing your devices, network, and organization apply to any of these "alternative devices", as well as the typical devices. We care about risk, and we mitigate against those risks when we design and improve our information systems. </p>
			<p>When you read about a new control, consider what risk they are actually solving (and not just what the marketing material says). When you're designing new systems or evaluating your existing ones, consider your controls and whether there's a gap that could allow for exploitation, and if that gap should be filled, depending on if the level of risk is unacceptable according to your risk management policy. </p>
			<p>One other point I would like to raise in regard to designing secure systems is this: in your design for your system, please ensure you are able to keep the system up to date with the latest updates and patches! So many of the issues we see today are still because systems weren't designed in a way that allows for updates, be it due to legacy software not being compatible with new operating systems, or because of a limited access to the internet as a result of <strong class="bold">air-gapping</strong>. Design a process that allows for the updating of all of your assets, regardless of if they need to be air-gapped or not, and create a plan to ensure that your systems work on the most up-to-date versions possible. Keep track of whether your systems are running the latest versions through your asset register or configuration management tool (which I'll talk about in <a href="B16611_07_Final_JM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor123"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></a>, <em class="italic">Owning Security Operations</em>), and update your risk register if a known vulnerability exists in an operating system or software version that is <a id="_idIndexMarker413"/>being used in your estate. If you're able to preemptively anticipate this and include these plans and processes in your design and implementation consideration, it's going to be a huge leap forward for your organization's security in the future. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-67"><a id="_idTextAnchor074"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we covered an incredibly vast amount of information, and I must reiterate like a broken record that each and every one of these key terms in this chapter could have an entire book (or series) devoted to a deep dive into them. The purpose of this book is more focused on reacquainting you with the key points, helping you look at each of these in the right way, and applying high-level principles to your knowledge to increase your effectiveness at your organization.</p>
			<p>From assets and their vulnerabilities, to threat actors and their motivations, to the methodologies that those threat actors use to exploit the vulnerabilities in our assets, we leapt across several major issues in information security, both from strategic and operational standpoints, in order to properly understand the landscape. </p>
			<p>By understanding the landscape, we moved into applying our risk management principles and knowledge surrounding the impact and likelihood of a threat exploiting a vulnerability, to mitigate and control against various risks. After looking at how to choose the appropriate controls for each risk, how the controls are categorized, and how many of them work, we looked at how to design systems with these risks in mind from the beginning, to ensure a more secure design by default and see how we might contribute to improve our own organization's systems the next time there's a discussion around their design. </p>
			<p>Now that we're done with this chapter, let's move on to the next one, which I've alluded to a few times already.</p>
