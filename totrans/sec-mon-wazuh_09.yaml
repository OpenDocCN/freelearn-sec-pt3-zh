    actions based on specific triggers. This helps security professionals to manage
    security incidents in a prompt and effective manner. Some actions that can be
    executed include a firewall drop or block, account block, deleting malicious files,
    blocking a suspicious network connection, and isolating an infected endpoint.

    where passwords, login credentials, and encryption keys are cracked through a
    process of trial and error. It is a straightforward yet effective strategy for
    getting unauthorized access to user accounts, company networks, and systems. Until
    they discover the right login details, the hacker attempts a variety of usernames
    and passwords, frequently testing a large range of combinations on a machine.

    involves assessing infrastructure that handles cardholder data, analyzing the
    system vulnerabilities, and remediating the exploitable vulnerabilities to secure
    the network.'
