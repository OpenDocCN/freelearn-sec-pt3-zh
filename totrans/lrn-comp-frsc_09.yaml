    communication between users is a daily activity. It is uncommon for a household
    not to have a device connected to the internet in some manner. They give students
    in elementary school devices to connect to the internet to enhance their education.
    Email addresses, URLs, social media, and file sharing are all vectors of activities
    a user can partake in. It is up to the user to decide whether their online activities
    will meet social norms and be accepted or whether they will cross the line and
    conduct criminal activity. Your job as a digital forensic investigator will be
    to investigate their activities in the digital realm.

    a fast and efficient user experience and experienced very few exploits. Chrome
    stores much of the data within different databases and provides us with the option
    of syncing data across multiple platforms. This means you may come across artifacts

    through web-based technology such as a mobile device application. In some situations,

    rarely require a fee from the user and are very simple to use.

    Users will share videos or music files with the community, but you can find almost
    any file type you can imagine. P2P has legitimate and illegitimate uses, depending
    on the user’s search criteria. It is a popular method of sharing illicit images
    and videos with other users in the P2P community. There are several P2P applications
    the user can choose from. I cannot give a detailed analysis of all potential P2P
    applications, but we will discuss some more common P2P applications you may run
    into during your investigations.
  prefs: []

- en: P2P applications allow the user to become a node on the network. When the user
    installs the application, they can designate which files/folders they want to
    make available to the P2P network. The application will then create an index of
    the shared files/folders to share on the P2P network. When the user searches the
    P2P network and finds a file they wish to download, the application will identify
    all the nodes possessing that file. The application will then connect to the nodes
    and start downloading pieces of the file from all the available nodes.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When the P2P application shares the files/folders, it tracks the filename and
    the file type and creates a SHA-1 hash value for the file. This will be a variation
    of the SHA-1 hash value used by the commercial and open-source forensic tools.
    The P2P version of the SHA-1 creates a hash value using the Base32 numbering system,
    while the forensic tools use the Base16 numbering system. The Base16 numbering
    system uses the alphanumeric characters 0–9 and A–F, while the Base32 numbering
    system uses the alphanumeric characters A–Z and 2–7\. Chris Hurst posted how to
    use Python to convert Base32 values into Base16 (available at [https://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent/wiki/How-to-convert-base32-to-base16-info-hashes](https://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent/wiki/How-to-convert-base32-to-base16-info-hashes)).

    may be looking for may be stored on a server located one mile away or several
    thousand miles away in another jurisdiction. Investigating when the hardware is
    not physically available creates significant issues for the digital forensic investigator.
    If you are law enforcement and you have a search warrant, is the search warrant
    valid for data maintained by the service provider outside of your jurisdiction?
    For the corporate investigator, a search warrant is not an option, but if the
    data is stored in a jurisdiction where the privacy expectations differ from where
    the investigation is based, you may also run into issues with accessing the data.
