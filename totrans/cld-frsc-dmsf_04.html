<h3 id="_idParaDest-39" class="calibre6"><a id="_idTextAnchor043" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/>Exploring the Major Cloud Providers</h3>
<p class="calibre3">As discussed in <a href="part0019_split_000.html#_idTextAnchor013" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"><span><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></span></a>, cloud computing has become the preferred choice for many organizations looking to modernize their IT infrastructure and take advantage of the benefits of cloud adoption. As incident responders, it is important to focus on the digital forensics of popular cloud service providers due to their widespread adoption by organizations. Among the top cloud service providers on the market, you will most likely encounter three main <a id="_idIndexMarker158" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/>cloud providers<a id="_idIndexMarker159" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/> in your next cloud<a id="_idIndexMarker160" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/> forensics project: <strong class="bold">Amazon Web Services</strong> (<strong class="bold">AWS</strong>), <strong class="bold">Microsoft Azure</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Google Cloud </strong><span><strong class="bold">Platform</strong></span><span> (</span><span><strong class="bold">GCP</strong></span><span>).</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">Understanding how these providers work, their security measures, and where forensic artifacts may be stored is crucial for organizations looking to ensure the security of their data and applications, as well as being crucial for incident responders looking to respond to security incidents. Each cloud service provider has its own architecture and security controls, which must be understood to ensure that forensic investigations are conducted effectively. For example, AWS, Azure, and GCP all have different approaches to data storage, access control, and logging, which can impact <span>forensic investigations.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">In this chapter, we will explore the importance of knowing about these three most common cloud service providers and their most common services. By understanding the cloud service providers, organizations can be better prepared to respond to security incidents and conduct forensic investigations in <span>the cloud.</span></p>
<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
<p class="callout">The purpose of this chapter is to gain a high-level familiarity with the industry’s leading cloud providers and their products—we will dive deeper into log resources and responding to incidents for each cloud provider in <em class="italic">Parts 2</em> and <em class="italic">3</em> of <span>this book.</span></p>

<h1 id="_idParaDest-40" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor044" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/>Amazon Web Services (AWS)</h1>
<p class="calibre3">Introduced in 2006, AWS is a<a id="_idIndexMarker161" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/> cloud computing platform that provides a wide range of services to help organizations build and deploy their applications and infrastructure. AWS offers infrastructure and computing resources at scale and allows organizations to virtualize their entire IT infrastructure in the cloud, making AWS a critical tool for many organizations. Incident responders, in particular, need to have a solid understanding of AWS as it has become one of the most popular platforms for hosting critical systems <span>and services.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">AWS offers a vast array of services, each designed to meet the specific needs of organizations and developers. With over 200 services available, it can be overwhelming to navigate the platform, especially for those new to AWS. In this section, we will focus on the core services that are commonly <a id="_idIndexMarker162" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/>used by organizations of all sizes. These include compute services such as Amazon <strong class="bold">Elastic Compute Cloud</strong> (<strong class="bold">EC2</strong>), storage services such as Amazon <strong class="bold">Simple Storage Service</strong> (<strong class="bold">S3</strong>), database services <a id="_idIndexMarker163" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/>such as Amazon <strong class="bold">Relational Database Service</strong> (<strong class="bold">RDS</strong>), networking <a id="_idIndexMarker164" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/>services such as <a id="_idIndexMarker165" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/>Amazon <strong class="bold">Virtual Private Cloud</strong> (<strong class="bold">VPC</strong>), and<a id="_idIndexMarker166" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/> security services such as AWS <strong class="bold">Identity and Access </strong><span><strong class="bold">Management</strong></span><span> (</span><span><strong class="bold">IAM</strong></span><span>).</span></p>

<h2 id="_idParaDest-41" class="calibre10"><a id="_idTextAnchor045" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/>Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)</h2>
<p class="calibre3">Amazon EC2 is a web <a id="_idIndexMarker167" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/>service provided by AWS that allows organizations to create virtualized infrastructure or servers (also known as virtual machines) and run them in the cloud. EC2 enables organizations to have complete control over their computing resources and provides a scalable and flexible infrastructure for building applications. With EC2, organizations can launch and manage virtual servers called instances, which can be configured with different computing capabilities, storage capacities, and networking features. It is important to note, for DFIR teams, that AWS refers to these virtual machines<a id="_idIndexMarker168" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/> as <em class="italic">instances</em> and each virtual machine is identified using an <span>instance identifier.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">EC2 provides several benefits that make it an important tool for organizations of all sizes. First, it offers on-demand scalability, which means organizations can easily adjust their computing resources as their needs change. EC2 also provides a high level of availability, with multiple Availability Zones and automatic failover capabilities. Additionally, EC2 is highly customizable, allowing organizations to choose from a wide range of instance types, operating systems, and <span>software configurations.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">The following screenshot demonstrates Amazon EC2 instance creation through the web GUI, including options to customize the virtual machine operating system, hardware, networking, and <span>storage capabilities.</span></p>
<div class="calibre2">
<div class="img---figure" id="_idContainer014"><img alt="Figure 3.1 – Launching an instance in Amazon EC2" src="../images/00058.jpeg" class="calibre26"/></div>
</div>
<p class="img---caption" lang="en-US">Figure 3.1 – Launching an instance in Amazon EC2</p>
<p class="calibre3">Organizations <a id="_idIndexMarker169" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/>can also utilize AWS’s CLI to create instances and other AWS resources. The AWS CLI<a id="_idIndexMarker170" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/> is a powerful tool provided by AWS that allows organizations to manage their AWS resources and services through a CLI. As an example, organizations can create an instance by running a specific command, such as <strong class="source-inline">aws ec2 run-instances</strong>, followed by the necessary parameters you would normally define through the GUI, such as instance type, security groups, and key pairs. This enables organizations to automate the process of instance creation and provisioning in AWS, enhancing efficiency <span>and scalability.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">For incident responders, EC2 is particularly important because it provides a flexible and scalable infrastructure for responding to security incidents. EC2 instances can be quickly spun up (i.e., through the creation of new virtual machines) to handle increased workloads during an incident. EC2 instances can be easily isolated and quarantined, allowing incident responders to contain the incident and prevent it from spreading to other parts of <span>the organization.</span></p>

<h2 id="_idParaDest-42" class="calibre10"><a id="_idTextAnchor046" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/>Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)</h2>
<p class="calibre3">Amazon VPC is a cloud-based networking <a id="_idIndexMarker171" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/>service that enables organizations to create and manage their own private virtual network in the AWS cloud. With VPC, organizations can create isolated sections of the AWS cloud, called subnets, and control access to these subnets through custom network <strong class="bold">Access Control Lists</strong> (<strong class="bold">ACLs</strong>) and <a id="_idIndexMarker172" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/>security groups. Note that, by default, AWS will create a VPC instance when you create a new instance in AWS. The VPC comes with a default configuration but allows you to customize it per your needs. Similar to AWS EC2 instances, each VPC is identified through a V<a id="_idTextAnchor047" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/>PC ID by AWS. VPCs can be created as needed or any existing VPCs can be accessed within your AWS VPC dashboard. An example of a VPC is shown in the <span>following diagram:</span></p>
<div class="calibre2">
<div class="img---figure" id="_idContainer015"><img alt="Figure 3.2 – Amazon VPC example" src="../images/00140.jpeg" class="calibre27"/></div>
</div>
<p class="img---caption" lang="en-US">Figure 3.2 – Amazon VPC example</p>
<p class="calibre3">From a digital forensics and incident response perspective, VPC provides several key benefits. First, it enables organizations to create an isolated and secure environment for their computing resources, reducing the risk of unauthorized access or data breaches. Second, it provides granular control over network traffic, allowing organizations to monitor and restrict access to specific resources and subnets. Finally, it enables organizations to create a centralized logging and monitoring solution, making it easier to detect and respond to <span>security incidents.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">To respond to incidents in a <a id="_idIndexMarker173" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/>VPC, responders must first identify the affected resources and isolate them within the VPC. They can then use AWS tools, such as AWS CloudTrail and AWS CloudWatch, to monitor network traffic and identify any suspicious activity. Incident responders can also leverage the VPC’s custom network ACLs and security groups to restrict access to the affected resources and limit the spread of the incident. Responding to incidents in AWS will be discussed in <em class="italic">Part 2</em> of <span>this book.</span></p>

<p class="calibre3">Amazon S3 is <a id="_idIndexMarker174" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/>a cloud-based object storage service offered by AWS. S3 enables organizations to store, retrieve, and manage large amounts of data in a highly scalable, secure, and cost-effective manner. S3 is a crucial component of many organizations’ data storage and backup strategies, and it is used for a wide range of use cases, including data lakes, web and mobile applications, backups, and disaster recovery. AWS refers to each S3 instance as <a id="_idIndexMarker175" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/>a <strong class="bold">bucket</strong> and, by default, when an organization creates an S3 bucket, it is not publicly available on the internet. You will need to make necessary changes to allow public accessibility over the internet. However, do note, misconfigurations in S3 buckets will allow data on S3 to be available on the internet (even if it was not intended to be). So, it is important that S3 buckets are <span>configured appropriately.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">From a digital forensics and incident response perspective, S3 provides several key benefits. First, it enables organizations to store large amounts of data in a secure and scalable manner, making it easier for investigators and responders to access and analyze data. Second, S3 provides a range of security and compliance features, including encryption, access control, and audit logging, which help organizations protect their data and comply with applicable regulations. Finally, S3 enables organizations to quickly and easily recover from data loss or corruption, reducing the impact of incidents on <span>their operations.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">Digital forensics investigators can use S3 to analyze data in a secure and scalable environment. By accessing an organization’s S3 buckets, investigators can examine the data stored within them, identify patterns and anomalies, and extract relevant evidence. They can also use S3’s audit logging features to track changes to the buckets and identify any <span>suspicious activity.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">The following <a id="_idIndexMarker176" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/>screenshot demonstrates the creation process for an AWS S3 bucket. Buckets will require a name as well as an AWS Region as the general configuration, ownership/access configuration, as well as <span>server-side encryption.</span></p>

<h2 id="_idParaDest-44" class="calibre10"><a id="_idTextAnchor049" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/>AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)</h2>
<p class="calibre3">AWS IAM is a<a id="_idIndexMarker177" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/> web service offered by AWS that provides a secure and centralized way to manage user identities and access to AWS resources. IAM allows organizations to control who can access AWS resources, and what actions they can perform on those resources. This enables organizations to enforce security policies, maintain compliance, and reduce the risk of unauthorized access or <span>data breaches.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">IAM is important because it enables organizations to manage user access to AWS resources in a granular and scalable way. With IAM, organizations can create and manage organizations, groups, and roles, and assign specific permissions to each one. This helps to ensure that only authorized organizations can access AWS resources and that they can only perform the actions that are necessary for their job responsibilities. The IAM module allows organizations to set up granular access to controls for relevant <span>AWS resources.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">From a digital forensics and incident response perspective, IAM provides several key benefits. First, it enables investigators and responders to identify and track user activity within AWS resources. By analyzing IAM logs, investigators can identify which users were granted access to specific resources, and when they accessed them. This information can help investigators identify potential security breaches, data exfiltration attempts, or other <span>suspicious activity.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">Second, IAM enables organizations to respond quickly to security incidents by revoking access to AWS resources for specific organizations or groups. This can help to contain the impact of an incident and prevent further unauthorized access or data breaches. IAM also provides the ability to create temporary access keys for specific use cases, which can help to limit the scope of potential damage in the event of a <span>compromised key.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">To use an organization’s IAM for digital forensics and incident response purposes, investigators and responders must have the appropriate permissions to access and analyze IAM logs. IAM logs provide a detailed record of user activity within AWS resources, including who accessed them, when they were accessed, and what actions were performed. By analyzing these logs, investigators can identify patterns of suspicious activity, track user behavior, and correlate events across different AWS services. The following screenshot shows the IAM dashboard containing a list of all users, roles, policies, and<a id="_idIndexMarker178" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/> access reports (Access Analyzer reports, credential reports, and organization activities in relation <span>to </span><span><a id="_idIndexMarker179" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/></span><span>IAM):</span></p>

<p class="calibre3">Amazon RDS is a <a id="_idIndexMarker180" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/>managed service offered by AWS that enables organizations to create, operate, and scale relational databases in the cloud. With RDS, organizations can choose from popular database engines such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server and easily manage their databases without worrying about infrastructure management. RDS automates time-consuming database administration tasks, such as patching, backups, and software upgrades, allowing organizations to focus on their <span>core business.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">RDS is an essential service for organizations that require a scalable, reliable, and cost-effective way to manage their relational databases in the cloud. With RDS, organizations can easily create and manage multiple database instances, each with their own database engine, storage capacity, and performance metrics. RDS also supports high availability and disaster recovery options, such as multi-Availability-Zone deployments, automatic failover, and backups, ensuring that organizations’ data is always accessible and protected. Amazon RDS database instances can be accessed through any database client for the specific database engine (e.g., MariaDB, Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, etc.). To find the database instance connection information (i.e., host, port, and user) for a created database instance, organizations can use the AWS RDS console, found in the AWS Management Console, and navigate to their database instance’s <strong class="bold">Connectivity</strong> and <strong class="bold">Security</strong> tab. Other methods to find connection information include the AWS CLI or the <span>RDS API.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">Digital forensics and incident responders can use an organization’s RDS to investigate and respond to security incidents and data breaches. RDS provides audit logging, which allows organizations to monitor database activity, such as user logins, SQL statements, and modifications to database objects. Audit logs can be exported to Amazon S3 for long-term retention <span>and analysis.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">In the event of a <a id="_idIndexMarker181" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre2 pcalibre"/>security incident or data breach, incident responders can use RDS to perform forensic analysis, such as identifying the source of the attack, determining the extent of the compromise, and assessing the impact on the organization’s data. Incident responders can use RDS snapshots to create a point-in-time copy of the database instance before the incident occurred, allowing them to analyze the database contents and activity leading up to the incident. Incident responders can also restore the snapshot to a new RDS instance for <span>further analysis.</span></p>
