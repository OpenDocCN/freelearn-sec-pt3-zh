			<p><em class="italic">"At home and on the street, our security relies on ourselves…the same concept applies on the cyberspace."</em></p>
			<p><em class="italic">– Miguel Angel Rodriguez, former President of Costa Rica and former secretary of the OEA </em></p>
			<p>One of the most precious resources that we have is the collection of links (favorites or bookmarks) that we have gathered through the years.</p>
			<p>In fact, your favorites are a valuable collection of tools, information, and best practices gathered through years of professional experience. </p>
			<p>Therefore, I decided to dedicate this final chapter to sharing with you a collection of links that you can leverage to improve your digital toolbox of web resources for cybersecurity.</p>
			<p>These links are divided into three categories:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>A collection of cybersecurity templates</li>
				<li>Must-have web resources (vulnerabilities repositories, attack maps, password tools, and more)</li>
				<li>References to industry-leading best practices</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-418"><a id="_idTextAnchor432"/>Free cybersecurity templates</h1>
			<p>Here is a compilation of useful<a id="_idIndexMarker1727"/> templates that you can leverage in your role as a cybersecurity expert sorted by categories.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-419"><a id="_idTextAnchor433"/>Business continuity plan and disaster recovery plan templates</h2>
			<p>There are thousands<a id="_idIndexMarker1728"/> of <strong class="bold">Business Continuity Plan</strong> (<strong class="bold">BCP</strong>) templates<a id="_idIndexMarker1729"/> on the web; however, the ones created by government agencies are usually the best option<a id="_idIndexMarker1730"/> because they are well prepared, based on international standards, and free:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>BCP template from Manchester City Council: <a href="https://www.manchester.gov.uk/downloads/download/5701/mbcf_business_continuity_plan_template">https://www.manchester.gov.uk/downloads/download/5701/mbcf_business_continuity_plan_template</a></li>
				<li>BCP template and guide from Hertfordshire County Council in the UK: <a href="https://www.hertfordshire.gov.uk/services/business/business-advice/business-continuity-and-fire-safety.aspx">https://www.hertfordshire.gov.uk/services/business/business-advice/business-continuity-and-fire-safety.aspx</a></li>
				<li>BCP template from Durham County Council in the UK: <a href="https://www.durham.gov.uk/media/888/Small-Business-and-Voluntary-Organisations-Business-Continuity-Plan/pdf/SmallBusinessAndVoluntaryOrganisationBusinessContinuityTemplate.pdf?m=635568457135400000">https://www.durham.gov.uk/media/888/Small-Business-and-Voluntary-Organisations-Business-Continuity-Plan/pdf/SmallBusinessAndVoluntaryOrganisationBusinessCont inuityTemplate.pdf?m=635568457135400000</a></li>
				<li>BCP template provided by the City of Cambridge: <a href="https://www.cambridgema.gov/-/media/Files/CDD/EconDev/SmallBusiness/unitedwaybusinesscontinuitytemplate.pdf">https://www.cambridgema.gov/-/media/Files/CDD/EconDev/SmallBusiness/unitedwaybusinesscontinuitytemplate.pdf</a></li>
			</ul>
			<p>The following is a comprehensive list of templates and information about continuity planning that <a id="_idIndexMarker1731"/>includes the <strong class="bold">BCP</strong>, <strong class="bold">Disaster Recovery Plan</strong> (<strong class="bold">DRP</strong>), and <a id="_idIndexMarker1732"/>risk management: <a href="https://www.business.qld.gov.au/running-business/protecting-business/risk-management/continuity-planning/plan">https://www.business.qld.gov.au/running-business/protecting-business/risk-management/continuity-planning/plan</a></p>
			<p>The following website contains a plurality of resources, including how to carry out business impact analysis and creating a BCP and even a DRP: <a href="https://www.ready.gov/it-disaster-recovery-plan">https://www.ready.gov/it-disaster-recovery-plan</a></p>
			<p>Here is another great example of a DRP created by the University of Southern California: <a href="https://fsep.usc.edu/files/2019/02/Disaster-Recovery-Plan-Template.pdf">https://fsep.usc.edu/files/2019/02/Disaster-Recovery-Plan-Template.pdf</a></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-420"><a id="_idTextAnchor434"/>Risk management</h2>
			<p>Here is a series of <a id="_idIndexMarker1733"/>documents about risk management<a id="_idIndexMarker1734"/> published by the UK government called the <em class="italic">Orange Book</em>: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/orange-book">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/orange-book</a>.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-421"><a id="_idTextAnchor435"/>Design and management of cybersecurity policies and procedures</h2>
			<p>Cybersecurity policies are not just about creating a document based on a template and storing it forever in an unknown place.</p>
			<p>In fact, cybersecurity policies<a id="_idIndexMarker1735"/> and procedures are one of the most important assets that you will have as they represent the baseline of the cybersecurity of your organization. Therefore, you must understand how to properly develop and manage those policies and procedures to ensure your defensive security strategy has a strong baseline.</p>
			<p>Our recommendation is to use<a id="_idIndexMarker1736"/> the CUDSE method because, as illustrated in the following figure, it shows you how to properly manage your cybersecurity policies throughout all the life cycles:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_18.1_B16290.jpg" alt="Figure 18.1 – The CUDSE method&#13;&#10;"/>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 18.1 – The CUDSE method</p>
			<p>The official site <a id="_idIndexMarker1737"/>of this method can be found at <a href="http://www.cudse.com">http://www.cudse.com</a>.</p>
			<p>This is an open initiative, so feel free to register on the web page if you want to be involved as an editor or contributor of future versions of the method.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-422"><a id="_idTextAnchor436"/>Must-have web resources</h1>
			<p>This is a <a id="_idIndexMarker1738"/>very nice <em class="italic">cybersecurity controls checklist</em> that you can leverage for a quick audit, or take it <a id="_idIndexMarker1739"/>as the basis to create your own: <a href="https://www.utah.gov/beready/business/documents/BRUCyberSecurityChecklist.pdf">https://www.utah.gov/beready/business/documents/BRUCyberSecurityChecklist.pdf</a></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-423"><a id="_idTextAnchor437"/>Cyber threat or digital attack maps</h2>
			<p>These pages<a id="_idIndexMarker1740"/> show in real time a graphical representation of the cyber-attacks that are currently happening in the world.</p>
			<p>As seen in the following figure, the pages also display additional data such as the most targeted countries and attacks by industry:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_18.2_B16290.jpg" alt="Figure 18.2 – Live cyber threat map&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 18.2 – Live cyber threat map</p>
			<p>Some of the <a id="_idIndexMarker1741"/>most famous threat maps<a id="_idIndexMarker1742"/> are the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://threatmap.checkpoint.com/">https://threatmap.checkpoint.com/</a></li>
				<li><a href="https://www.imperva.com/cyber-threat-attack-map/">https://www.imperva.com/cyber-threat-attack-map/</a></li>
				<li><a href="https://www.fireeye.com/cyber-map/threat-map.html">https://www.fireeye.com/cyber-map/threat-map.html</a></li>
			</ul>
			<p>These pages are very useful for the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Awareness training</li>
				<li>Cybersecurity presentations</li>
				<li>Highlighting the relevance of defensive security in a given industry</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Additionally, there are pages such as <a href="https://www.digitalattackmap.com/#anim=1&amp;color=0&amp;country=ALL&amp;list=0&amp;time=18763&amp;view=map">https://www.digitalattackmap.com/#anim=1&amp;color=0&amp;country=ALL&amp;list=0&amp;time=18763&amp;view=map</a> that allow you to show the visualization based on the date. This is very interesting because it allows you to correlate the number of attacks with a given date, for example, the increase of attacks during elections, holidays, and so on.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-424"><a id="_idTextAnchor438"/>Cybersecurity certifications</h2>
			<p>There are <a id="_idIndexMarker1743"/>many companies that offer cybersecurity <a id="_idIndexMarker1744"/>certifications; however, not all of them give you the same value for your money. Therefore, let me share with you some key aspects to consider before enrolling in a cybersecurity certification.</p>
			<h3>International validation</h3>
			<p>A PDF can be easily <a id="_idIndexMarker1745"/>duplicated; therefore, you need to ensure that your certification authority gives you a digital token that you can share with others to confirm that your certification is real and not a <em class="italic">photoshopped PDF</em>. </p>
			<p>Here, the best solution is to use a <strong class="bold">digital badge</strong> that can be used to verify that you are the real holder of the <a id="_idIndexMarker1746"/>certification. <strong class="bold">Digital badge technologies</strong> vary and the latest ones can even verified by scanning the digital badge on a website (very cool).</p>
			<h3>Updated literature and content</h3>
			<p>Cybersecurity<a id="_idIndexMarker1747"/> is a field that changes rapidly; therefore, you need to ensure that the certification authority that you select uses updated content for the certification and examination and avoid those that have been using the same content for years.</p>
			<h3>Innovation</h3>
			<p>There are too <a id="_idIndexMarker1748"/>many certification authorities that are just the same, so explore new certification authorities that dare to innovate with <em class="italic">new proposals, new examinations, new content, new proposals, and even new certification schemes (including digital badges)</em> as those are the ones that will give your CV a differentiation factor.</p>
			<h3>Validated and managed by experts</h3>
			<p>Another <a id="_idIndexMarker1749"/>important item to check is <em class="italic">who runs the certification authority</em>; for example, <em class="italic">it's better to select a certification authority that is backed and run by cybersecurity experts</em> that really know the field instead of a group of investors and managers that are not familiar with the field.</p>
			<p>Therefore, we highly recommend the <strong class="bold">International Innovation and Certification Council</strong> (<strong class="bold">I2C2x</strong>), which is a certification authority managed and owned by cybersecurity experts<a id="_idIndexMarker1750"/> who are committed to increasing the level of cybersecurity around the world.</p>
			<p>For more information, visit their site at <a href="http://i2c2x.com">i2c2x.com</a>.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-425"><a id="_idTextAnchor439"/>Cybersecurity news and blogs</h2>
			<p>Almost every day, a <a id="_idIndexMarker1751"/>new blog or site related to cybersecurity is created; however, not all of them are run by experts, which may cause some of them to be sharing incorrect or even fake news; therefore, it is very important to ensure that the sites you visit are the best, so let me share some of the best cybersecurity sources in the world.</p>
			<p>Internationally known as one of the best sources of cybersecurity news is the following: <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/">https://krebsonsecurity.com/</a></p>
			<p>They have been producing high-quality video content about cybersecurity for the last 15 years, including tips, hardware hacks, and news. </p>
			<p>A must-have bookmark for every <a id="_idIndexMarker1752"/>cybersecurity pro is the <strong class="bold">Hak5 podcast</strong>: <a href="https://hak5.org/pages/videos">https://hak5.org/pages/videos</a></p>
			<p>One of the best forums to exchange knowledge about cybersecurity is the following: <a href="https://security.stackexchange.com/">https://security.stackexchange.com/</a></p>
			<p>But wait, there is also very good content created in other languages, such as Spanish! For example, you can visit the show <em class="italic">Noches de Cyberseguridad</em>, which every week brings experts from Latin America to discuss different topics regarding cybersecurity: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/nochesdeciberseguridad/">https://www.facebook.com/nochesdeciberseguridad/</a></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-426"><a id="_idTextAnchor440"/>Cybersecurity tools</h2>
			<p>Here, I am going<a id="_idIndexMarker1753"/> to summarize a list of must-have web resources to have handy and saved in your favorites. We already talked about some of the resources in the book; however, due to their importance, it is better to highlight them here too.</p>

			<p>I know there are many other tools; this was only a highlight of some of the best tools covered in this book. Let's move on to some of the most used resources that are related to passwords.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-427"><a id="_idTextAnchor441"/>Password-related tools</h2>
			<p>Weak <a id="_idIndexMarker1756"/>passwords or bad password management practices<a id="_idIndexMarker1757"/> are the cause of a big portion of cybersecurity breaches, so here are the must-have resources related to password management.</p>
			<p>This site was developed to determine if a given email was found on a previous data breach and therefore the password must be changed and never used again: <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/">https://haveibeenpwned.com/</a></p>
			<p>This website <a id="_idIndexMarker1758"/>is a great resource to highlight the danger of weak passwords. This is especially useful in cybersecurity presentations or awareness campaigns: <a href="https://www.grc.com/haystack.htm">https://www.grc.com/haystack.htm</a></p>
