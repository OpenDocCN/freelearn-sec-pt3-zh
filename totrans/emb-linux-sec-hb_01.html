			<h1 id="_idParaDest-19"><a id="_idTextAnchor018"/>Welcome to the Cyber Security Landscape</h1>&#13;
			<p>Cue up the music. <em class="italic">Welcome to the Jungle</em>. The cyber security landscape is ever-changing and evolving. One could easily compare it to the mercurial New England weather patterns in the Northeast of the United States. Such weather can be dangerous for a hiker; similarly, such changes in cyber threats can be devastating for a <a id="_idTextAnchor019"/>technology solution.</p>&#13;
			<p>In the coming chapters, we will dive deeper into the<a id="_idIndexMarker000"/> realm of <strong class="bold">Linux-embedded systems</strong> (or embedded Linux systems, also known as Linux appliances, or simply appliances) and exactly how you can apply this new knowledge to secure your solutions. We’ll make this journey together, and at the end of the tunnel, you will be best positioned to build a better appliance.</p>&#13;
			<p>This chapter is here just to set the foundation of Linux-embedded systems before we dive deeper. In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>What is a Linux-embedded system?</li>&#13;
				<li>How are Linux-embedded systems used?</li>&#13;
				<li>Why is securing Linux-embedded systems so important?</li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>Let’s get started.<a id="_idTextAnchor020"/><a id="_idTextAnchor021"/></p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-20"><a id="_idTextAnchor022"/>What is a Linux-embedded system?</h1>&#13;
			<p>It’s probably safe<a id="_idIndexMarker001"/> to assume that if you’re reading this book, you may have some knowledge of what your company defines as a Linux-embedded system. To truly have a rich understanding of this subject, let’s review the <strong class="bold">appliance model</strong> for <a id="_idIndexMarker002"/>creating sellable solutions.</p>&#13;
			<p>The <strong class="bold">appliance model</strong> provides solutions and services that an organization (or individual) cannot easily build for themselves. This also addresses another limitation; oftentimes, users of these appliances have little to no access to any technologists who would take on ownership of the care of said solution. The appliance model is most prevalent in home consumer electronics but touches every known vertical in the industry.</p>&#13;
			<p>Most appliances leverage purpose-built hardware and have unique form factors that best enable their usage. These solutions are all around us every day. Some easily identifiable consumer appliance examples would be your home’s Wi-Fi router, cable TV box, or smart laundry washing machine. A resounding example would be the smartphones that we all carry and cannot imagine living without.</p>&#13;
			<p>Let’s affectionately pick a generic home Wi-Fi router to dive deeper into the appliance model concepts. Virtually anyone can use its services without understanding how the underlying technology works or is implemented.</p>&#13;
			<p>The router has a custom form factor for far more than aesthetics. The housing contains all the electronic components needed to successfully provide the services for which it’s intended. Inside, there’s a small computer running a Linux operating system. I bet you can see where I am going with this. This is how we came to call these offerings <em class="italic">Linux-embedded systems</em>, as they contain a custom computer and a Linux operating system, along with custom software to provide a unique set of services to the intended end-user.</p>&#13;
			<p>Defining an appliance<a id="_idIndexMarker003"/> doesn’t stop there. It must provide a service, or services, which can be easily consumed by its end-users. In an appliance, this is achieved by the implementation of complex software and the appropriate hardware. In that home Wi-Fi router example, the manufacturer has built it to provide a simple-to-use web-based interface in order to <em class="italic">manage</em> the services provided. In this case, this is how the end-users allow people to access wireless internet.</p>&#13;
			<p>Another key facet of the appliance model that must be built in is the ability to accept and process updates to its configuration or software, which absolutely includes its Linux operating system. It has to be simple for the end-user; one must assume the end-user is not technical. If the end-users actually possessed the technical capabilities, they could, in theory, build this themselves and you’d be out of business. Staying with the Wi-Fi router example, it has built into its web interface the simple function for self-updating. The end-user clicks on a button in the interface and the magic happens behind the scenes. Programmatically, the appliance gets an update package from a secure repository provided by the solutions builder; it downloads the package; and then finally processes all those application and Linux updates without any intervention by the end-user. The process notifies the end-user of its completion status (and sometimes requires a restart of the appliance).</p>&#13;
			<p>Not every embedded Linux system (appliance) is on dedicated hardware. The advent of virtualization and, more recently, the great push to move things into the cloud have unleashed a whole new delivery <a id="_idIndexMarker004"/>method: the <strong class="bold">virtual appliance</strong>.</p>&#13;
			<p>Virtual appliances are rapidly gaining traction in multiple cloud marketplaces. Why? It’s simple. Companies that, for many years, have produced on-premises appliance solutions have had to evolve in order to retain their customer base. Because of this, many solutions builders now offer an on-premises hardware offering, a virtual appliance for an on-premises offering, and a cloud provider-based virtual appliance offering.</p>&#13;
			<p>Generally, each of these solutions can be built from the same code base, however, depending on what exactly the appliance provides the end-user, it may need to be tailored and refactored differently for each virtualization platform’s networking and security requirements. This is because the cloud providers (often referred to as <strong class="bold">hyperscalers</strong>) each <a id="_idIndexMarker005"/>have their own proprietary methods and APIs for networking, security, and end-user access. What I mean by this specifically is the application stack may be unified upon all delivery methods; however, the virtual machine image format, networking, and other facets will be different. For example, Azure and Google handle their network stack quite differently. Storage is also quite different. Hence, the <strong class="bold">user interface</strong> (<strong class="bold">UI</strong>), especially<a id="_idIndexMarker006"/> for the appliance’s setup, needs to have these differences in virtualization platforms or hyperscalers’ requirements taken into consideration.</p>&#13;
			<p>Next, we’ll review how embedded Linux systems are util<a id="_idTextAnchor023"/><a id="_idTextAnchor024"/>ized.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-21"><a id="_idTextAnchor025"/>How are Linux-embedded systems used?</h1>&#13;
			<p>Linux-embedded <a id="_idIndexMarker007"/>systems are everywhere. Most people don’t give it a second thought. I venture the guess that you reach for one of these things when you first wake up in the morning and engage with it countless times every day. Your smartphone is a Linux-embedded system and, in my opinion, is an awesome example of one.</p>&#13;
			<p>Embedded Linux systems surround us; some with stealth, others with pure elegance and entertainment, with all the beauty and grace their builders have instilled in their design. These appliance solutions run a massive range of use cases. Some are a complete solution and others are but a simple component to a greater ecosystem or solution.</p>&#13;
			<p>Most, when successfully designed and implemented, provide services to their user community seamlessly without the user even having to think about what is happening under the covers. Much of this must be credited to how resilient, lightweight, and flexible Linux solutions can be. A Microsoft Windows-embedded system is far more reliant on its GUI components than Linux. It’s far easier to deliver a complete solution on Linux with a GUI than its Windows-based competition.</p>&#13;
			<p>Here, I will try to provide a generalized list of where Linux is leveraged today (regardless of distribution or hardware platform) in providing services. I’ll throw in my disclaimer as well – this list is general at best and may not include all use cases currently deployed. I present this in no particular order and will try not to leave anything out but it would be impossible for me to<a id="_idIndexMarker008"/> list everywhere Linux-embedded systems are<a id="_idTextAnchor026"/> in use. So, let’s look at the following list:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Artificial intelligence (AI)</strong>: Linux is at the heart of all AI advancements in recent years. It is the preferred operating system of choice due to its flexibility and vast developer base. As this field is rapidly evolving, the possibilities are limitless and often classified, such as the following:<ul><li>Facial recognition systems</li><li>Artistic graphical rendering systems</li><li>Language pr<a id="_idTextAnchor027"/>ocessing</li></ul></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Agriculture</strong>: As agriculture around the world has begun to embrace operations at ever-growing scales, technology has been needed to assist with the following operations:<ul><li>Heavy equipment monitoring solutions</li><li>GPS-guided equipment navigation</li><li>Produce grading and sorting systems</li><li>Production tracking<a id="_idTextAnchor028"/> systems</li></ul></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Automotive</strong>: Embedded Linux reigns supreme in this rapidly evolving transportation space. Countless embedded Linux systems can be found today, stealthily providing many critical services, such as the following:<ul><li>Autonomous vehicle operating systems and components</li><li>Sensors and safety systems</li><li>GPS navigation</li><li>Electric vehicle charging infras<a id="_idTextAnchor029"/>tructure</li></ul></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Aviation</strong>: Civilian aviation and transportation is a booming business for Linux-embedded systems solutions. These complex appliances can be found in the following areas (assuming you have the proper security clearance):<ul><li>Baggage scanning systems</li><li>Passenger screening solutions</li><li>Baggage shipping and tracking systems</li><li>Radar and air traffic control systems</li><li>Traveler <a id="_idIndexMarker009"/>identification and verificatio<a id="_idTextAnchor030"/>n systems</li></ul></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Building management and construction</strong>: Building management controls have long been solved by Linux-based solutions providers. The following is but a mere example of some of the high-tech solutions:<ul><li>Card key access systems</li><li>Environmental control systems</li><li>HVAC management systems</li><li>Fire detection and suppression systems</li><li>Alar<a id="_idTextAnchor031"/>m systems</li></ul></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Telecommunications</strong>: In my opinion, this vertical has seen the most growth, which is second only to those related to military projects. <strong class="bold">Virtualization</strong> has empowered<a id="_idIndexMarker010"/> the proliferation of a whole new breed of <strong class="bold">network functions virtualization</strong> (<strong class="bold">NFV</strong>) solutions. Both<a id="_idIndexMarker011"/> physical and virtual appliances in this space dwarf deployments virtually anywhere else. These virtual appliances can be found in server rooms, telco closets, data centers, and cloud providers’ marketplaces in order to make it easier to provide access to the following services:<ul><li><strong class="bold">Radio access </strong><strong class="bold">networks</strong> (<strong class="bold">RANs</strong>)</li><li>Load <a id="_idIndexMarker012"/>balancers</li><li>Routing solutions</li><li><strong class="bold">Push-to-talk</strong> (<strong class="bold">PTT</strong>) phone <a id="_idIndexMarker013"/>systems</li><li>Geo-locational-tracking solutions</li><li>Domain Name System (DNS) solutions</li><li>IP address management solutions</li><li>Firewall solutions</li><li>Email filtering solutions</li><li>Operations management systems that control fiber-based connectivity to<a id="_idTextAnchor032"/> the internet</li></ul></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Geology</strong>: Mostly<a id="_idIndexMarker014"/> driven by energy companies and government agency needs, this vertical has seen exceptional growth in the past five years. Although they may not be mainstream, these appliances provide many valuable services to academia and the energy industry, such as the following:<ul><li>Near real-time geological scanning and assessment solutions</li><li>Modeling systems</li><li>Seismic trac<a id="_idTextAnchor033"/>king solutions</li></ul></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Healthcare</strong>: Linux systems are vastly deployed in almost every facet <a id="_idTextAnchor034"/>of healthcare, whose focus on security and patient safety is paramount. Hospital efficiency has been greatly improved as well. Many of the new appliance solutions can be found in virtually any healthcare practice, providing some of the following life-saving services:<ul><li>Patient safety solutions</li><li>Electronic records solutions</li><li>Patient monitoring solutions</li><li>Ventilators</li><li>Lab testing solutions</li><li>Imaging systems (PET scan, MRI scan, C<a id="_idTextAnchor035"/>AT scan, etc.)</li></ul></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Industrial and manufacturing</strong>: Industrial automation has been prolific for over two decades, however, some key players in this space have revolutionized what used to be manual processes. Embedded Linux systems reduce costs and accelerate production<a id="_idIndexMarker015"/> rates by providing some of the following services:<ul><li>Industrial manufacturing automation systems</li><li>Environmental and safety mon<a id="_idTextAnchor036"/>itoring systems</li></ul></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Military</strong>: So, in order to keep those guys in black suits from coming to visit me in an unfriendly manner, I’ll generalize, especially in this vertical, to preserve my life (and add a little intrigue to the mix). Linux appliances can stealthily be found providing critical security and defense-related services, such as the following:<ul><li>Facial recognition systems</li><li>Data gathering solutions</li><li>Components to countless vehicles and aircraft</li><li>Radar systems</li><li>Guidance systems</li><li>Nav<a id="_idTextAnchor037"/>igation systems</li></ul></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Space</strong>: Without Linux and open source technologies, this vertical would not be achieving what it is today. Embedded Linux systems are reaching for the heavens. A few examples are as follows:<ul><li>Space exploration vehicles (example: Cassini)</li><li>Satellites</li><li>Rovers</li><li>Sensor systems</li><li>GPS systems</li><li>Ground-based management systems</li><li>S<a id="_idTextAnchor038"/>pace telescopes</li></ul></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Weather</strong>: Government agencies, aviation, highway safety, oceanic shipping, and other transportation agencies all rely upon data provided by Linux-embedded systems solutions for continuity of travel and public safety. These appliances, which can be found globally, provide the following services:<ul><li>Weather modeling and prediction solutions</li><li>Ground and aerial radar systems</li></ul></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>In summary, we’ve <a id="_idIndexMarker016"/>highlighted just some of the critical and interesting services embedded Linux systems provide today that enrich our lives, protect us silently, and help us travel to places that were once b<a id="_idTextAnchor039"/><a id="_idTextAnchor040"/>eyond our reach.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-22"><a id="_idTextAnchor041"/>Why is securing Linux-embedded systems so important?</h1>&#13;
			<p>Why is securing<a id="_idIndexMarker017"/> Linux-embedded solutions systems (appliances) so important? Well, this answer truly has multiple aspects depending on who you ask.</p>&#13;
			<p>The most obvious answer would simply be to prevent liability and loss of credibility in the marketplace. Lately, it seems that there’s an ever-growing list of companies whose offerings have become compromised and, as a result, their customers are grievously impacted.</p>&#13;
			<p>The impact of such a breach can be the loss of personal information for the users (insert gasp here!) or even worse, unauthorized access to systems or data without the knowledge of those running the systems. Each year, these breaches result in billions of dollars in correlated losses and open these companies to legal action by their user base. The image impact on one’s brand can last far longer in people’s minds than you’d think.</p>&#13;
			<p>It’s highly documented that data leaks, breaches, and other security lapses are often done by internal staff and contractors. This does not imply malfeasance. Often, it can be a lapse of judgment, forgetting to remove sensitive data from development environments, or accidentally taking home sensitive data on a device that itself gets lost, stolen, or compromised.</p>&#13;
			<p>Then, there are the situations caused by intentional misuse of a system. Sadly, these events, in my opinion, can be the easiest to prevent. We will definitely dive deep into this matter in later chapters. Misuse comes in many forms. It starts with unauthorized access to a system or exceeding one’s intended limits. Then, there are those events where someone intentionally uses an application or system in a manner that it was not intended for. The worst-case scenario is when software on a system is modified, installed, or disabled so that an individual can perform tasks or monitor others. These are the situations where the wheels fall off the wagon.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-23"><a id="_idTextAnchor042"/>Examples where embedded Linux systems had a security breach</h2>&#13;
			<p>In 2019, hackers <a id="_idIndexMarker018"/>compromised Ring security cameras and gained access to their video and audio streams, wreaking havoc with those devices’ owners’ lives. Several incidents were reported in several states. Software updates and better password requirements keep those bad actors out now.</p>&#13;
			<p>Another example of a breach of security is when, in 2017, it was found that St. Jude’s cardiac implants could be hacked. When I heard of this, I was amazed and scared for those patients. Thankfully, St. Jude has patched the vulnerability and no patients were actually harmed.</p>&#13;
			<p>A research team at IBM was able to compromise the firmware update mechanism of a Jeep in mid-2015. They demonstrated how a bad actor could actually take control of the vehicle by speeding it up, steering the wheel, or applying the brakes. It’s kind of frightening to think that a bad actor could wreck your family drive. These gaps have quickly been closed.</p>&#13;
			<p>Hopefully, these few public examples can help reinforce just how important it is to design an embedded Linux appliance with security in mind.</p>&#13;
			<p>Detecting these unauthorized changes or breaches can be rather difficult, especially if you no longer have access to your product once the customer takes delivery and begins consuming its services. Preventing them altogether is so much easier.</p>&#13;
			<p>You may have heard the old saying, <em class="italic">an ounce of prevention is worth a ton of cure</em>. If you apply even some or all of the lessons this book seeks to impart upon you, it’s like having ten pounds of prevention and <em class="italic">all</em> the cure. We’ll dive deep into hardware security, operating systems security, secure connectivity, and how to know what threats you must prepare for.</p>&#13;
			<p>Not every method or technology in this book may apply to your solution or even be feasible, but the more <a id="_idIndexMarker019"/>you apply these methodologies, the more likely you will create a rock-solid product. That said, may the only headlines your company creates be those of success and accolades.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-24"><a id="_idTextAnchor043"/>Summary</h1>&#13;
			<p>In this first chapter, you will have gained a solid understanding of how an embedded Linux system is defined. We’ve shown you some wide-ranging examples of where embedded Linux systems are leveraged today. Most importantly, we’ve reviewed some critical reasons why having these devices delivered to their customers as securely as possible is mandatory for those building such solutions. In the next chapter, we’ll dive deep into why security starts with a great design.</p>&#13;
