    accessibility of information on the internet. Understanding the fundamental concepts
    is essential for anyone involved in cybersecurity.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The two primary concepts in web security, **authentication** and **authorization**,
    serve as the foundation for safeguarding digital interactions. **Authentication**,
    the process of validating a user’s identity, is equivalent to submitting identification
    at a security checkpoint. This verifies that the individual attempting to access
    a system is who they are claiming to be. **Authorization**, on the other hand,
    specifies the actions that an authenticated user may carry out within the system.
    Consider its permissions; not everyone who has been validated at the security
    checkpoint has access to all the locations.

- en: Furthermore, encryption is another strong defender of data transfer integrity.
    It employs complex algorithms to convert data into unreadable code, guaranteeing
    that the information remains incomprehensible to unauthorized entities even if
    intercepted. The backbone of secure data transit is made up of symmetric and asymmetric
    encryption algorithms, each with its own set of strengths. Understanding **Secure
    Sockets Layer** (**SSL**) and **Transport Layer Security** (**TLS**) certificates—the
    internet’s digital passports—is critical. The SSL/TLS protocols encrypt data as
    it is in transit, enabling secure communication channels that are essential for
    online interactions.

    (**HTTP**). HTTP is the foundation of World Wide Web data transfer. It is an application
    layer protocol that allows data to be transferred over the internet between a
    client (such as a web browser) and a server (where web pages or other resources
    are hosted). Let’s see an explanation of how HTTP works with a request and response.

    in the sophistication and diversity of attacks targeting these applications. Cybersecurity
    breaches can jeopardize valuable user data, interfere with corporate operations,
    and damage an organization’s brand. Python web applications become vulnerable
    to a variety of security vulnerabilities, including SQL injection, XSS, and **cross-site
    request forgery** (**CSRF**). The consequences of these vulnerabilities can be
    severe, demanding an effective cybersecurity strategy.

    procedures. Password hashing, which uses algorithms such as `bcrypt` or `Argon2`,
    adds an extra degree of security by ensuring that plaintext passwords are never
    saved. **Two-factor authentication** (**2FA**) adds an additional verification
    step to user authentication, increasing security. **Role-Based Access Control**
    (**RBAC**) allows developers to provide specific permissions to different user
    roles, guaranteeing that users only access functionality relevant to their responsibilities.

    attempts. Using secure cookies with the `HttpOnly` and `Secure` characteristics
    prohibits client-side script access and ensures that cookies are only sent over
    HTTPS. Session timeouts and measures such as session rotation can improve session
    security even further.

    Parameterized queries, made possible by libraries such as `sqlite3`, protect against
    SQL injection by separating data from SQL commands. Output encoding, achieved
    with techniques such as `html.escape()`, avoids XSS threats by converting user
    inputs to innocuous text. Similarly, omitting functions such as `eval()` and `exec()`
    avoids uncontrolled code execution, lowering the likelihood of code injection
    attacks.
