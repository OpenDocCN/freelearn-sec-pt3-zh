    you will need to create a strategy that will enable you to conduct an efficient
    investigation. You also need to make sure you are familiar with your tools and
    the results that they will provide. Without a process, you will waste time examining
    data that will not impact your investigation, and you will not be able to rely
    on your tools. In addition, you want to make sure you get valid results from the
    tools you deploy. Finally, to be thorough and efficient, you must use critical
    thinking to determine the best investigation or exam method.

    that will require you to have an exam strategy to be efficient. I am not a fan
    of keeping an examination checklist because there will be areas that aren’t relevant,
    such as different operating systems, physical topography of the network, criminal
    elements, and suspects. These variables ensure that no two examinations or investigations
    are the same and will require the investigator to execute a different strategy
    for each of them.

    field or a lab environment. Now is the time to determine your hardware, personnel,
    and training budget. Some of those costs will not be a one-time expenditure but
    will be an ongoing budget expenditure. The equipment must be updated, personnel
    training must be maintained, and the purchase of new technology as it becomes
    available.

    machine to collect volatile data, which will change the evidence. In reality,
    the changes you make typically do not affect what you are investigating. But you
    should know that changes are being made to the system; you may get asked a question
    about potential changes to the evidence while testifying at the administrative
    or judicial proceeding. If you don’t know the answer, it could be professionally
    embarrassing.

    found in RAM. That is why you need to take notes and document everything you do.
    Some examples of volatile data we collect are the current state of the system
    networking information (the ARP table, connections, routing table, and name cache),
    the logged-on users, running services, running processes, shared drives, remote
    activity, and open encrypted containers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    forever. The term “forensically sound manner” means leaving the smallest possible
    footprint during collection to minimize the amount of data being changed with
    the collection. The order of collecting volatile data is significant because if
    you collect volatile data in the wrong order, you may destroy the evidence you
    are looking for. RAM is considered to be the most volatile of all volatile data,
    so we would want to collect that first.

    steps taken to download that material. Suppose the user had any ongoing communications

    dealing with illicit images where the investigator made the unequivocal statement
    that the user knew about the illegal image. They found the image in question in

    not absolute proof that the user knew about the image. The system can include

    is PDF. No matter what format you use, make sure you digitally sign the report.
    The digital signature will show that no one has altered the report since you signed
    it.

    create a poor report, that will reflect poorly on you, the investigation, and
    your organization.

    review process. You will miss typographical errors, poor sentence structures,
    and unclear findings. What may be clear to you in your mind may not always be
    accurately transcribed in written form. Suppose the investigation proceeds to
    administrative or judicial proceedings. In that case, I can guarantee the opposition
    will dissect your report line by line, looking for inconsistencies and places
    where you were not objective.

    how to prepare to conduct a digital forensic examination, from getting the proper
    equipment to the training and getting certification. In addition, you now understand
    the importance of obtaining information before seizing digital evidence and ensuring
    you talk to other investigators or personnel involved in the situation.

    not, you will lose a large amount of potential evidence. Next, we discussed some
    strategies for conducting your examination and the differences between an OS artifact
    and a filesystem artifact. Lastly, we discussed reporting your findings so that
    the reader easily understands them.
