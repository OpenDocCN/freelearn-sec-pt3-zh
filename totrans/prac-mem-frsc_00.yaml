- en: Memory forensics is a powerful analysis technique that could be used in different
    areas from incident response to malware analysis. For an experienced investigator,
    memory is an essential source of valuable data. Memory forensics not only provides
    key insights into the user's context and allows you to look for unique traces
    of malware, but also, in some cases, helps to piece together the puzzle of a sophisticated
    targeted attack.

- en: This book will introduce you to the concept of memory forensics and then gradually
    progress deep into more advanced concepts of hunting and investigating advanced
    malware using free tools and memory analysis frameworks. This book takes a practical
    approach and uses memory images from real incidents to help you get a better understanding
    of the subject so that you will be equipped with the skills required to investigate
    and respond to malware-related incidents and complex targeted attacks. This book
    touches on the topic of Windows, Linux, and macOS internals and covers concepts,
    techniques, and tools to detect, investigate, and hunt threats using memory forensics.

- en: By the end of this book, you will be well versed in memory forensics and will
    have gained hands-on experience of using various tools associated with it. You
    will be able to create and analyze memory dumps on your own, examine user activity,
    detect traces of fileless malware, and reconstruct the actions taken by threat
    actors.

    Forensics?*, explains why memory forensics is a vital part of many digital forensic
    examinations nowadays based on real-world examples, describing the main goals
    and investigation techniques used by DFIR specialists as well as discussing daily
    challenges they face.'

    Process*, familiarizes you with the basic techniques and tools used for memory
    acquisition, and the possible issues associated with this process. In addition,
    you will have the opportunity to compare live memory analysis with that of memory
    dumps by examining the pros and cons.'

    User Activity with Windows Memory Forensics*, looks at reconstructing user activity,
    which is essential for many cases since it gives a better understanding of what
    is going on. This chapter provides some insights into user action recovery techniques
    based not only on running processes and network connections but also on the analysis
    of the Windows registry and file system in memory.'

    and Analysis with Windows Memory Forensics*, tackles how modern malware tends
    to leave as few traces as possible on the disk, which is why memory analysis is
    becoming a critical element of forensic investigation. In this chapter, we will
    explain how to search for traces of malicious software in process memory as well
    as in the Windows Registry, event logs, and file system artifacts in memory.'

    some volatile memory on disk. This chapter introduces alternative sources of volatile
    data in Windows along with the tools and techniques for their analysis.'
