Being able to advise legal counsel or the investigation team on the outcome of an examination puts the practitioner in a unique and privileged position.</p><p>Irrespective of the outcome, the practitioner's advice cannot be ignored. It is not uncommon for the examination to reveal very little information of value; nothing had been present to recover in many instances. However, it is common for the client and lawyer to say that the venture was productive in that it could be set aside and the search for evidence could focus elsewhere. It is also pleasing to secure evidence that helps secure a conviction or acquittal too, depending on the party who engaged the practitioner.</p><p>Practitioners do not <a id="id734" class="indexterm"/>work in a vacuum. They do follow standard processes and develop their own through case experience and court outcomes. The question is whether the standards are adequate and easy to interpret and apply in practice. Practitioners are constantly updating their knowledge of new and evolving applications and devices. Accumulating expertise is a journey of discovery for them.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. The Nature and Special Properties of Digital Evidence">Chapter 3</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>The Nature and Special Properties of Digital Evidence</em></span>, presented processes for recovering data from devices using sophisticated tools such as ILookIX and described the nature of digital evidence: where it could be found, how it could be recovered, and how it could be used in an investigation. Much information was condensed into that chapter, all of which could fill a book in itself. It would suffice to say that an understanding of the characteristics of digital evidence is a prerequisite for an entrée to the discipline. Furthermore, digital evidence is not static: new types of files, applications, operating systems, storage repositories, communications networks, and processes emerge with surprising frequency.</p><p>The practitioner must keep up with these trends, yet little is published or shared, leaving it to the individual to explore new formats and processes and determine the best way to recover and process evidence. Exchanging discoveries is slow and tedious and usually restricted to publications and reviews, and they normally take an eternity to publish after peer review, are made into a quick blog post but not properly reviewed, or are kept "within house" because of confidentiality and privacy issues. This book does not provide encyclopedic coverage of digital evidence, but it has covered a considerable cross-section of the discipline.</p><p>The practitioner needs to be able to explain the properties of digital evidence and the role it plays in adding to the weight of a case but must ensure that it passes the admissibility rules. Explaining the soundness and authenticity of the evidence, as well as being able to provide some corroboration to assist the court in assessing its worth, goes beyond merely selecting and presenting the evidence, for it is the role of the practitioner to interpret and explain the full and likely meaning of the evidence and metadata to the layperson.</p><p>As the discipline evolves and hopefully matures, it is practitioners who will lead the charge, but if they do not research and share any knowledge, it is going to be a ponderous exercise for them. Not all practitioners have the time even if they have the inclination to share their discoveries and experiences, and as mentioned before, there are confidentiality impositions too. In <a class="link" href="ch09.html" title="Chapter 9. Validating the Evidence">Chapter 9</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Validating the Evidence</em></span>, an evidence-validation process was introduced, and there may be merit in adopting such a process as a training tool for novice practitioners as well as a navigation tool for the more experienced. The process could be updated as new issues arise and used beyond its admissibility-checking design.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Solutions to the challenges posed by new hardware and software"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl1sec75"/>Solutions to the challenges posed by new hardware and software</h1></div></div></div><p>
<a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Hardware and Software Environments">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Hardware and Software Environments</em></span>, described different operating systems and filesystems and<a id="id735" class="indexterm"/> introduced processes for locating evidence of potential value. Filesystems have become ponderously complex, perhaps unnecessarily so, but in doing so, they do retain information about past transgressions that may have otherwise been erased. The challenge is knowing where to look—assuming the practitioner knows how to navigate new operating systems and applications.</p><p>The traditional processes of imaging-indexing-searching or imaging and manually searching are becoming untenable; the sheer size and complexity is time-consuming and not necessarily guaranteed to locate the evidence, except by chance in many instances. There will always be a place for "deep rinse" analysis, but there are more effective ways. My research and fieldwork has shown that while it is difficult to part with familiar processes such as these, there exists a better way of recovering potential evidence.</p><p>The ISeekDiscovery automaton is presently being modified to be used in criminal investigations in addition to its role in e-discovery. The automaton is capable of recovering deleted files and registry files as well as collecting all specific file types. Several criminal defense cases have been tested using ILookIX and ISeekDiscovery, and the recovery rates were high, but ISeekDiscovery was able to capture just what was needed and was far more effective in cataloging and processing the recovered data.</p><p>While traditional tools can catalog and zero-eliminate duplicate files to reduce the dataset, they fall short of the automaton's ability to seek and return results in shorter periods and undertake follow-up searches based on preliminary analysis. Putting this in an e-discovery and network setting, the automaton can be launched remotely and the results viewed securely and remotely for extraction to legal process teams. Savings in time, travel, expensive practitioners, and inherent system challenges are eliminated. This enables the practitioner to access and analyze evidence more quickly and devote more time to evidence analysis.</p></div>
<div class="section" title="More efficacious evidence recovery and preservation"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl1sec76"/>More efficacious evidence recovery and preservation</h1></div></div></div><p>What seems certain is the challenge of new technologies and the ability to recover evidence from an unabated<a id="id736" class="indexterm"/> increase in large and complex datasets. This requires a pragmatic approach to evidence recovery, and existing forensic tools for criminal and e-discovery do not achieve this. In my opinion, they are obsolete processes and really do not provide the support needed for speedy evidence analysis. This book has introduced new technologies and processes of preserving digital evidence and making recovery quicker and more reliable.</p><p>The imaging of drives has been the traditional means of collecting digital information from desktop, laptop, and networked computers for most criminal investigations. Mobile phones and other handheld devices require different data extraction processes. For e-discovery, where it is<a id="id737" class="indexterm"/> common to seek evidence from networked systems, imaging is impractical, and indexing and copying massive datasets using complicated software installed on the networks has been normal practice.</p><p>Imaging using existing technology does not provide the best protection for collected evidence. Mobile phone extraction tends to capture only logical data and now rarely recovers the physical data needed for deeper analysis. E-discovery is proving to be too costly for many organizations in terms of time, experts, and disruption to networks using existing data recovery tools.</p><p>Extracting data from tablets and even certain desktop devices is becoming problematic because of system encryption and difficulty in booting a device for imaging. They are becoming frequent stumbling blocks, making it difficult and sometimes impossible to recover data from these devices. My research colleagues are constantly finding ways to overcome these obstacles, but it is a sad fact that the discipline usually lags some way behind the introduction of new types of devices and systems.</p><p>The tools presented by me, including the IXImager and ISeekDiscovery suites, preserve evidence securely and conveniently. The <code class="literal">.ASB</code> forensic container format is the only forensic image type secured inside a container that is self-authenticating as well as tamper-proof. The peace of mind this gives a practitioner, who always faces the trauma of having the record of custody challenged, is that the logging process has provenance: its authenticity can be verified.</p><p>Similarly, the ISeekDiscovery <code class="literal">.ISK</code> format is a secure vault that is transportable, leaves no footprint of data on the system, and is relatively small compared with tradition e-discovery datasets. Not only are these tool processes soundly secure, but they are smaller in size, being compressed, and, in the case of the <code class="literal">.ISK</code> vaults, require significantly less storage space.</p></div>
<div class="section" title="Challenges posed by communication media and the cloud"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl1sec77"/>Challenges posed by communication media and the cloud</h1></div></div></div><p>It is evident that mobile<a id="id738" class="indexterm"/> phones and other handheld devices are rivals of<a id="id739" class="indexterm"/> desktop and laptop computers, because they are portable, relatively affordable, and easy to use. Storage size is no longer a barrier to using these smaller devices because of the compactness of external storage media and the trend to store more personal and organizational data on remote servers such as the cloud.</p><p>This raises a number of scenarios. Those countries whose jurisdictions provide no safeguard for the <a id="id740" class="indexterm"/>privacy of data stored or transferred to and from these devices have unbridled access<a id="id741" class="indexterm"/> to private data, the main problem being the difficulty of recovering encrypted data. Other jurisdictions are more mindful of their citizens' right to privacy but still face the problem of recovering evidence from encrypted devices. The discipline is now probably at a watershed, with the storage of data being transformed into remote network hubs, less convenient to access than in the past and certainly infeasible to image!</p><p>Mobile telephony has posed its own obstacles to forensic recovery, adding to the general frustration of practitioners, who are denied access to the evidence that hides within a device.</p><div class="section" title="Mobile phone evidence recovery"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl2sec168"/>Mobile phone evidence recovery</h2></div></div></div><p>Recovery of data from <a id="id742" class="indexterm"/>Apple iPhones, in particular, is nearly impossible to accomplish. Android and other operating systems are heading the same way. New models and versions now make it virtually impossible to recover a logical extraction of these phones unless the passphrase or PIN has been decoded or provided by the device owner—often not an option. The days of recovering a full physical dump containing erased data have long since passed for iPhones and Android devices.</p><p>I have been evaluating a number of mobile phone forensic recovery tools, and none seem close to dealing with the problem. Disappointingly, the vendors are unusually quiet as to what progress is being made to gain access to these devices. My research colleagues are working hard towards a solution to decrypt some of these devices and recover a physical dump capable of being processed by ILookIX and ISeek. ILookIX has been able to recover, for example, some 60 percent additional data from an iPhone 4 that other mobile forensics tools could not. It is hoped that this recovery success is extended to new versions of the iPhone. So, dear reader, keep an eye out for updates, particularly in light of the FBI versus Apple debacle regarding access to iPhones.</p></div><div class="section" title="The cloud - convenient for users but problematic for practitioners"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl2sec169"/>The cloud - convenient for users but problematic for practitioners</h2></div></div></div><p>Access to cloud<a id="id743" class="indexterm"/> resources to recover digital evidence is often through the normal access protocol used by consumers to connect to the host server, even if it is not owned by the consumer. However, it is not a simple matter to identify the path that the data takes from the source storage device to the target storage device, and this path may not remain fixed. Moreover, the owner of the data usually does not have physical control of the server where it is held, thus complicating the desired imaging of stored data, which may be stored in another jurisdiction and may require travel and extra resources. This also means that the data is accessed and recovered by a non-practitioner with limited understanding of what should be recovered and who may be unreliable in protecting the admissibility of the evidence.</p><p>A more viable <a id="id744" class="indexterm"/>alternative is to recover data remotely using the ISeekDiscovery automaton, which is non-intrusive, can be launched remotely, is secure, and can segregate data to ensure compliance with court orders and warrants, compared to conventional recovery processes. These processes often require the server to be shut down for extended periods and can be intrusive and may contaminate the evidence and other data.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="The need for effective evidence processing and validation"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl1sec78"/>The need for effective evidence processing and validation</h1></div></div></div><p>This book has presented a range of digital forensics tools and introduced some lower-level processes <a id="id745" class="indexterm"/>used in the recovery, preservation, and analysis of potential evidence. <a class="link" href="ch09.html" title="Chapter 9. Validating the Evidence">Chapter 9</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Validating the Evidence</em></span>, presented a candidate model for validating digital evidence that could be considered a foundation for developing a model to assist practitioners in mapping their analysis processes and navigating digital evidence datasets and images. The need to test and check evidence is so important but sometimes paid mere lip service to.</p><p>Research by <span class="emphasis"><em>Adams</em></span> (2012) produced a formal and timely generic model for the forensic acquisition of digital data in criminal and civil environments, particularly in incident response, a field that is constantly evolving. The lack of any standard model across all areas of the discipline is vexing <a id="id746" class="indexterm"/>and Adams' <span class="strong"><strong>Advanced Data Acquisition Model</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>ADAM</strong></span>) has much to commend it to practitioners.</p><p>ADAM incorporates the following strictures relating to evidence acquisition:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The activities of the practitioner should not alter the original data</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">A complete record of all activities associated with the recovery and handling of the original data and any copies of the original data must be maintained, including compliance with the appropriate rules of evidence, maintaining a chain of custody record, and verification processes such as hashing</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The practitioner must not undertake any activities that are beyond their ability or knowledge</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The practitioner must take into consideration all aspects of personal safety while undertaking their work</li></ul></div><p>ADAM consists of three stages of acquisition of digital data: the initial planning stage, the onsite survey, and the acquisition of digital data. It is intended to provide clarity of the acquisition <a id="id747" class="indexterm"/>processes for presentation in<a id="id748" class="indexterm"/> legal hearings.

<div class="section" title="Contingency planning"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl1sec79"/>Contingency planning</h1></div></div></div><p>Strategic business <a id="id749" class="indexterm"/>management identifies assets at risk and anticipates the threats to them. Prudent organizations predict the risk and set up processes to mitigate the threat in advance or better manage the consequences after a security breach. An organization's IT team is often engaged in profiling the threat to electronic information and implementing threat minimization and management processes. Their primary role is to restore the functionality of electronic resources and networks after security breaches, including physical and personnel security.</p><p>Management and IT personnel are increasingly involved in investigating breaches of security, crime incidents, and personnel misconduct, as presented in the case study in <a class="link" href="ch09.html" title="Chapter 9. Validating the Evidence">Chapter 9</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Validating the Evidence</em></span>, yet they seldom possess the experience and wherewithal to preserve and recover evidence.</p><p>Difficulties confront business managers and non-forensic practitioners, who are often the unwitting custodians of digital evidence later relied upon in court. Organizations are not always familiar with the complexity of digital evidence and how to locate and recover it without altering its integrity. Without some preparation for the eventuality of an incident requiring the preservation of digital evidence, it becomes problematic for organizations to handle evidence in the organization's best interest.</p><p>Having seen organizations' lack of readiness to deal with incidents involving digital evidence recovery firsthand and with depressing regularity, I note here that those organizations that have a forensic contingency plan recover more quickly from an incident, with a greater probability of bringing offenders to account. It is really a prudent strategy for organizations big and small to have some form of forensic response in addition to a security incident contingency plan. While existing risk-assessment standards may be useful, they generally do not encompass a digital forensics response.</p><p>In civil e-discovery cases, the lack of preparation to meet discovery demands can be a costly experience and disruptive to an organization's information-management routine. Software programs are available that anticipate the likelihood of discovery, and this helps sanitize the discovery search process and reduce cost somewhat.</p><p>Such programs are not always affordable or thought necessary by smaller-sized businesses. Searching for e-mails is expensive during discovery for both parties, and in the Monica Lewinsky case, the cost of searching for relevant e-mail files was more than US $17 million. There is no doubt it would have been a fraction of that cost if the investigators had had access to the ISeekDiscovery automaton!</p><p>Some form of pragmatic forensic contingency plan is highly recommended, and may include the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">A contingency<a id="id750" class="indexterm"/> plan and the appointment of a team responsible for researching, maintaining, and testing it</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Using a <a id="id751" class="indexterm"/><span class="strong"><strong>Computer Incident Response Team</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>CIRT</strong></span>) to provide a professional investigation and response to investigate security incidents and recover and preserve digital evidence</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Raising standards and awareness of the problem</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Maintaining tightly configured network security to protect information assets and potential digital evidence</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Validating the security configuration of systems and the digital evidence by digital forensic practitioners</li></ul></div></div>

<div class="section" title="Summary"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl1sec81"/>Summary</h1></div></div></div><p>This chapter summarized the key topics presented in the book and reviewed trends affecting practitioners and stakeholders.</p><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Practical Digital Forensics</em></span> has introduced the discipline of digital forensics in such a way that the technical mystery has to some extent been moved aside to provide you with greater clarity about the fundamentals of the discipline. Case studies have been liberally peppered throughout the book, together with examples of analyses to highlight key recovery and analysis processes.</p><p>The book strongly endorses the need for a more pragmatic approach to manage digital information used in legal proceedings. It has described various ways of empowering digital forensic practitioners and other stakeholders through better processes and forensics tools.</p><p>New forensic tools that are emerging to enhance forensic examination have been shared with you, and these tools, especially ILookIX and the ISeekDiscovery automaton, are making the task of the practitioner more manageable and productive.</p><p>This has been a "warts and all" introduction to the discipline, as it would be unfair not to mention some of the heavy challenges facing practitioners. It is not a profession; it is a vocation, and one that can be very rewarding despite these challenges. I hope that some of you will find the book insightful and be encouraged to look towards digital forensics as your true vocation. For the seasoned practitioner, I hope that something within these pages strikes the right chord as well as providing you with a view of new tools and processes.</p><p>I and my colleagues are disappointed with the lack of professionalism of some practitioners. Whether this is attributable to arrogance, ignorance, complacency, or some other cause, they are clearly not acting as servants of the court. As intimated in <a class="link" href="ch09.html" title="Chapter 9. Validating the Evidence">Chapter 9</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Validating the Evidence</em></span>, he who pays the piper does not call the tune—practitioners answer to a higher authority than their clients and employers. The objective of the book was to make a positive contribution to the field of literature relating to the discipline by presenting processes and tools to enhance the professionalism of practitioners.</p><p>However, it is a sad fact that the immaturity of the discipline includes a complacency about standards and accountability—all too frequent within government and private organizations. This book would be glorifying the discipline far in excess of its present stature by not mentioning these deficiencies, notwithstanding the really positive work of most practitioners and the benefits offered by emerging processes and tools.</p><p>To stress the point, in a recent case, a colleague of mine engaged by a defense legal team was tasked to authenticate audio files of conversations covertly recorded by a government agency. The colleague, an experienced forensic practitioner, formerly trained and working in several government forensic teams, found that the audio files were not the original data but copies produced by data-archiving software. Having the original data was essential to examine the audio for any possible alteration post recovery.</p><p>After several months of procrastination from the government agents and their consistent insistence that the data provided was original, they conceded that it was not, despite earlier assurances that the hashing logs related to the original data, when in fact they did not. Moreover, it was not possible for the agents to provide any form of provenance as to the authenticity of the hashing logs, unlike the forensic image container protection afforded by the <code class="literal">.ASB</code> forensic container file described in <a class="link" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Recovering and Preserving Digital Evidence">Chapter 4</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Recovering and Preserving Digital Evidence</em></span>. The agent had apparently hashed the copied data and not the original, bringing into question the integrity of the data. It appeared the agents did not know, did not care, or possibly lied about the preservation and recovery processes for some obscure reason.</p><p>A validation test, such as that described in <a class="link" href="ch09.html" title="Chapter 9. Validating the Evidence">Chapter 9</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Validating the Evidence</em></span>, to test the integrity of the imaging or preservation process, was evidently not applied. What really amazed the practitioner was a statement from one of the agents, evidently irritated that the evidence was being challenged to such an extent, to the effect of, "We're not employed to be forensic analysts—we just collect intelligence."</p><p>This book has highlighted trends in digital forensic practice and called for better strategies for managing increasingly large and complex datasets—obviously needed, considering the agent's outburst above!</p><p>Those in the profession and those contemplating joining should not be overly disconcerted by these recurring examples of poor practice, for this is a very rewarding discipline, especially when receiving recognition for a job well done. The sense of achievement in locating and analyzing information that was hard won adds to the experience, which in turns builds a secure foundation for practitioners. The discipline needs fresh blood that questions everything and is not satisfied with the "enough is good enough" outlook that exists. Most importantly, it should never be overlooked that a practitioner's learning, like in other professions, is never complete.</p></div></body></html>
