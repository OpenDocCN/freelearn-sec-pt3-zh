			<h2 id="_idParaDest-33" class="calibre7"><a id="_idTextAnchor047" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>The offensive security lifecycle</h2>
			<p class="calibre3">The offensive security lifecycle is a critical component of proactive security. It describes the methodical <a id="_idIndexMarker053" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>technique used by ethical hackers to simulate real-world cyber threats, identify weaknesses, and assess an organization’s digital defenses. This well-defined lifecycle provides a disciplined framework for discovering and mitigating vulnerabilities before attackers can exploit them. Throughout this section, we will explore each stage of the offensive security lifecycle, shedding light on the methods and approaches used.</p>
			<h3 class="calibre9">Planning and preparation</h3>
			<p class="calibre3">As we delve <a id="_idIndexMarker054" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>into planning and preparation, the cornerstone of the red teaming lifecycle, let us examine the key steps that form the bedrock of a strategic and well-informed cybersecurity offensive:</p>
			<ul class="calibre17">
				<li class="calibre16"><strong class="bold">Defining scope</strong>: Before any offensive security engagement can begin, it is crucial to define the scope of the assessment. This includes identifying the specific systems, networks, or applications that will be tested. Scoping ensures that the testing is focused on the most critical areas and prevents unintended consequences.</li>
				<li class="calibre16"><strong class="bold">Gathering essential information</strong>: Effective planning starts with comprehensive information-gathering. Ethical hackers will collect as much data as possible about the target organization, including network diagrams, system inventories, and any existing security policies. This information forms the basis for developing a tailored testing strategy.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="calibre3">Advancing to the next stage, we will explore reconnaissance, whereby cyber defenders gather the intelligence and insights necessary to identify and understand potential targets in the digital landscape.</p>
			<h3 class="calibre9">Reconnaissance</h3>
			<p class="calibre3">As we embark <a id="_idIndexMarker055" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>on the reconnaissance step, let us outline the critical steps involved in this intelligence-gathering phase, which is pivotal for laying the foundation of a successful offensive security strategy:</p>
			<ul class="calibre17">
				<li class="calibre16"><strong class="bold">Passive and active reconnaissance techniques</strong>: Reconnaissance is the initial <a id="_idIndexMarker056" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>phase of red teaming, wherein <a id="_idIndexMarker057" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>hackers gather information about the target. <strong class="bold">Passive reconnaissance</strong> involves <a id="_idIndexMarker058" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>collecting publicly available data, such as domain names, email addresses, and employee names, without <a id="_idIndexMarker059" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>directly interacting with the target. <strong class="bold">Active reconnaissance</strong>, on the other hand, includes actions such as port scanning and service probing to gain a deeper understanding of the target’s network and systems.</li>
				<li class="calibre16"><strong class="bold">Leveraging</strong> <strong class="bold">Open Source Intelligence</strong> (<strong class="bold">OSINT</strong>): OSINT is a valuable resource <a id="_idIndexMarker060" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>for ethical hackers during the reconnaissance phase. OSINT encompasses publicly available information from sources such as social media, public databases, and online forums. It provides insights into an organization’s personnel, technology stack, and potential weaknesses.</li>
				<li class="calibre16"><strong class="bold">Profiling target entities</strong>: Profiling involves creating detailed profiles of target entities, such as <a id="_idIndexMarker061" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>employees or network assets. Ethical hackers build these profiles to identify potential points of weakness, including employees that are susceptible to social engineering attacks or network segments that may lack adequate security controls.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="calibre3">Progressing from reconnaissance, we will now approach the scanning and enumeration stage, wherein we actively probe for weak spots, cataloging the digital environment’s details to pinpoint where an attack could take hold.</p>
			<h3 class="calibre9">Scanning and enumeration</h3>
			<p class="calibre3">Now, as we venture into scanning and enumeration, it is time to highlight the essential steps <a id="_idIndexMarker062" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>that sharpen our focus on the network’s vulnerabilities, crafting a clearer picture of the security landscape we aim to fortify:</p>
			<ul class="calibre17">
				<li class="calibre16"><strong class="bold">Network scanning strategies</strong>: Network scanning is the process of identifying active hosts, open ports, and services running on those ports within the target <a id="_idIndexMarker063" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>environment. Tools such <a id="_idIndexMarker064" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>as Nmap and <strong class="bold">Masscan</strong> are commonly used for network scanning. Ethical hackers use the results of network scans to create a map of the target’s infrastructure.</li>
				<li class="calibre16"><strong class="bold">Service enumeration methods</strong>: Once open ports are identified, service enumeration begins. This involves querying the services to gather additional information, such as software versions and configurations.</li>
				<li class="calibre16"><strong class="bold">Vulnerability scanning approaches</strong>: Vulnerability <a id="_idIndexMarker065" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>scanning tools, such as <strong class="bold">OpenVAS</strong> and <strong class="bold">Nessus</strong>, are employed to automatically <a id="_idIndexMarker066" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>identify known vulnerabilities within the target environment. These tools compare the identified services and software versions to vulnerability databases to pinpoint weaknesses that need further investigation.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="calibre3">Navigating deeper into the offensive security lifecycle, we arrive at the exploitation stage, where the identified vulnerabilities are put to the test and theoretical risks meet the reality of controlled cyber assault tactics.</p>
			<h3 class="calibre9">Exploitation</h3>
			<p class="calibre3">Moving <a id="_idIndexMarker067" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>forward, we reach the exploitation stage. Here, we precisely execute and maneuver through the uncovered vulnerabilities, transforming our gathered intelligence into actionable insights and strategic breaches:</p>
			<ul class="calibre17">
				<li class="calibre16"><strong class="bold">Vulnerability exploitation tactics</strong>: The exploitation phase involves attempting to leverage identified vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access or control over systems. Ethical hackers use various tactics, including known exploits, privilege escalation techniques, and payloads, to breach the target. The objective is not to cause harm but to demonstrate the potential impact of these vulnerabilities.</li>
				<li class="calibre16"><strong class="bold">Privilege escalation techniques</strong>: Privilege escalation is a crucial step in gaining more control over a compromised system. Ethical hackers explore ways to escalate their privileges, moving from a standard user to an administrator or root level. This allows them to access and manipulate critical system components.</li>
				<li class="calibre16"><strong class="bold">Post-exploitation considerations</strong>: After successfully exploiting a vulnerability, ethical hackers must consider the implications of their actions. They assess <a id="_idIndexMarker068" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>the extent of control gained and data accessed, as well as potential avenues for maintaining access. It is essential to act responsibly and ethically even during post-exploitation activities.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="calibre3">Shifting gears, we will transition to the maintaining access phase of our offensive security journey. In this phase, we will focus on sustaining the established connection to further scrutinize the system’s vulnerabilities and fortify our defensive mechanisms.</p>
			<h3 class="calibre9">Maintaining access</h3>
			<p class="calibre3">As we transition into this phase, it is time to stress the importance of establishing and sustaining <a id="_idIndexMarker069" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>secure and reliable connections. These connections enable us to gain a deeper understanding of system vulnerabilities and to reinforce our defense mechanisms:</p>
			<ul class="calibre17">
				<li class="calibre16"><strong class="bold">Ensuring persistence</strong>: Maintaining access is about ensuring continued control over a compromised system or network. Ethical hackers employ various techniques, such as creating backdoors, implanting malware, or establishing covert channels, to maintain their presence without detection.</li>
				<li class="calibre16"><strong class="bold">Evading detection</strong>: To avoid detection by security mechanisms and monitoring tools, ethical hackers continuously adapt and modify their tactics. Techniques include using encryption, disguising traffic, and employing anti-forensic methods to cover their tracks.</li>
				<li class="calibre16"><strong class="bold">Insights into backdoors and rootkits</strong>: Backdoors and rootkits are tools used to maintain unauthorized access. Backdoors provide a secret means of access, while rootkits can hide malicious activities from security monitoring tools.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="calibre3">Finally, we arrive <a id="_idIndexMarker070" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>at the reporting and documentation stage. In this concluding segment of the offensive security lifecycle, we will put a cap on our venture by recording insights and observations, paving the way for future endeavors and preventative measures.</p>
			<h3 class="calibre9">Reporting and documentation</h3>
			<p class="calibre3">In our <a id="_idIndexMarker071" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>concluding segment, we will stress the importance of meticulously recording observations, insights, and experiences. This forms the foundation for future cybersecurity efforts and allows for clearer and more directed defensive strategies:</p>
			<ul class="calibre17">
				<li class="calibre16"><strong class="bold">Crafting comprehensive reports</strong>: After the red teaming engagement is complete, ethical hackers create detailed reports that outline the entire process. These reports include a summary of the findings, vulnerabilities discovered, exploitation details, and recommendations for remediation.</li>
				<li class="calibre16"><strong class="bold">Impact analysis</strong>: Ethical hackers assess the potential impact of the vulnerabilities and exploits they discovered. This includes considering the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the compromised systems or data.</li>
				<li class="calibre16"><strong class="bold">Recommendations for mitigation</strong>: The last step in the offensive security lifecycle involves providing recommendations for mitigating the identified vulnerabilities and weaknesses. Ethical hackers work closely with the organization to develop a roadmap for addressing these issues, thereby strengthening the organization’s security posture.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="calibre3">Having completed our deep dive into the offensive security lifecycle, we will now shift our focus to exploring offensive security frameworks. This upcoming section will provide a comprehensive overview of the standardized structures that guide the implementation of robust cybersecurity measures in a consistent and organized manner.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-34" class="calibre7"><a id="_idTextAnchor048" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>Offensive security frameworks</h2>
			<p class="calibre3">Offensive security frameworks provide essential guidance and structure for security professionals <a id="_idIndexMarker072" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>when assessing and enhancing an organization’s security posture. These frameworks offer a systematic approach to understanding threats, vulnerabilities, and attack vectors, allowing organizations to better <a id="_idIndexMarker073" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>defend against potential cyberattacks. We will explore two significant offensive security frameworks: <strong class="bold">MITRE</strong> <strong class="bold">Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge</strong> (<strong class="bold">ATT&amp;CK</strong>) and STRIDE.</p>
			<h3 class="calibre9">The MITRE ATT&amp;CK framework</h3>
			<p class="calibre3">The MITRE ATT&amp;CK framework <a id="_idIndexMarker074" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>is a comprehensive knowledge <a id="_idIndexMarker075" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>base that categorizes the tactics and techniques used by threat actors during the various stages of a cyberattack. Developed and maintained by the MITRE corporation, this framework serves as a valuable resource for understanding the behaviors and methods employed by adversaries.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">The key features <a id="_idIndexMarker076" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>of MITRE ATT&amp;CK are as follows:</p>
			<ul class="calibre17">
				<li class="calibre16"><strong class="bold">Tactic-centric approach</strong>: MITRE ATT&amp;CK organizes attacks into tactics, representing high-level goals, such as <strong class="bold">initial access</strong>, <strong class="bold">execution</strong>, <strong class="bold">persistence</strong>, <strong class="bold">privilege escalation</strong>, <strong class="bold">defense evasion</strong>, <strong class="bold">credential access</strong>, <strong class="bold">discovery</strong>, <strong class="bold">lateral movement</strong>, <strong class="bold">collection</strong>, <strong class="bold">exfiltration</strong>, and <strong class="bold">impact</strong>.</li>
				<li class="calibre16"><strong class="bold">Technique descriptions</strong>: Each tactic comprises numerous techniques, providing detailed descriptions of how adversaries execute specific actions within a given tactic.</li>
				<li class="calibre16"><strong class="bold">Mapping to real-world attacks</strong>: MITRE ATT&amp;CK provides real-world examples and references to documented cyberattacks, allowing security professionals to relate the framework to practical threat scenarios.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="calibre3">MITRE ATT&amp;CK breaks down the tactics into a series of techniques, offering a granular view of the specific actions and procedures that attackers employ. Here are some examples of tactics and techniques:</p>
			<ul class="calibre17">
				<li class="calibre16"><strong class="bold">Initial access</strong>:<ul class="calibre18"><li class="calibre16"><strong class="bold">Tactic</strong>: This involves the initial breach or entry point into a network or system.</li><li class="calibre16"><strong class="bold">Techniques</strong>: Techniques under this tactic include spear-phishing, exploiting vulnerabilities, and drive-by compromise.</li></ul></li>
				<li class="calibre16"><strong class="bold">Execution</strong>:<ul class="calibre18"><li class="calibre16"><strong class="bold">Tactic</strong>: This encompasses the methods attackers use to execute malicious code.</li><li class="calibre16"><strong class="bold">Techniques</strong>: Techniques within this tactic include code execution via scripting, execution via API, and execution via malicious files.</li></ul></li>
				<li class="calibre16"><strong class="bold">Persistence</strong>:<ul class="calibre18"><li class="calibre16"><strong class="bold">Tactic</strong>: Persistence tactics are used to maintain unauthorized access to a compromised system.</li><li class="calibre16"><strong class="bold">Techniques</strong>: Techniques for persistence involve backdoors, scheduled tasks, and registry modifications.</li></ul></li>
			</ul>
			<p class="calibre3">MITRE ATT&amp;CK is a valuable tool for integrating threat intelligence into offensive security <a id="_idIndexMarker077" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>operations. By aligning threat intelligence with ATT&amp;CK tactics and techniques, security professionals can better understand the specific tactics employed by threat actors and proactively defend against them. This integration allows organizations to do the following:</p>
			<ul class="calibre17">
				<li class="calibre16">Identify potential threats by recognizing known attack patterns</li>
				<li class="calibre16">Prioritize security measures based on the tactics and techniques that pose the greatest risk</li>
				<li class="calibre16">Develop tailored detection and response strategies for each tactic and technique</li>
				<li class="calibre16">Enhance incident response by aligning it with the stages of the MITRE ATT&amp;CK framework</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="calibre3">The MITRE ATT&amp;CK framework, with its expansive and detailed approach to cataloging adversarial tactics and techniques, stands as an instrumental tool for organizations to understand the threat landscape comprehensively. It aids security teams in identifying gaps in defenses and provides a common lexicon to effectively communicate about cybersecurity issues. As we wrap up our discussion of this versatile framework, we will pivot toward <a id="_idIndexMarker078" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>another eminent paradigm in offensive security: the STRIDE model. Building on our understanding, let us delve into how STRIDE brings a unique, design-focused perspective to the cybersecurity arena.</p>
			<h3 class="calibre9">The STRIDE model</h3>
			<p class="calibre3">The STRIDE model <a id="_idIndexMarker079" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>is another security framework that focuses on identifying <a id="_idIndexMarker080" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>common threat categories. Developed by Microsoft, STRIDE helps security professionals assess the security of <a id="_idIndexMarker081" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>software systems by categorizing potential threats into six key areas, which are as follows:</p>
			<ul class="calibre17">
				<li class="calibre16"><strong class="bold">Spoofing</strong>: This involves masquerading as someone else, often to gain unauthorized access or deceive users. This includes identity spoofing and data spoofing.</li>
				<li class="calibre16"><strong class="bold">Tampering</strong>: This refers to the unauthorized modification or alteration of data or systems. This category includes data tampering and code tampering.</li>
				<li class="calibre16"><strong class="bold">Repudiation</strong>: This addresses situations where an entity denies its actions or involvement in a transaction. Non-repudiation mechanisms aim to prevent this.</li>
				<li class="calibre16"><strong class="bold">Information disclosure</strong>: This involves the unauthorized access or exposure of sensitive information. This includes unauthorized data access or eavesdropping.</li>
				<li class="calibre16"><strong class="bold">Denial of service</strong> (<strong class="bold">DoS</strong>): This focuses on disrupting system availability, often by <a id="_idIndexMarker082" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>overwhelming resources or exploiting vulnerabilities. <strong class="bold">Distributed Denial-of-Service</strong> (<strong class="bold">DDoS</strong>) attacks fall under this category.</li>
				<li class="calibre16"><strong class="bold">Elevation of privilege</strong>: This refers to the unauthorized escalation of user privileges, enabling attackers to perform actions they should not have permission to execute.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="calibre3">The STRIDE model serves as a valuable tool for identifying and addressing vulnerabilities in software systems. By categorizing potential threats into these six areas, security professionals can better understand the types of attacks to which their systems may be vulnerable. This understanding enables organizations to do the following:</p>
			<ul class="calibre17">
				<li class="calibre16">Prioritize security efforts by focusing on the most critical threat categories</li>
				<li class="calibre16">Implement security controls and countermeasures specific to each STRIDE category</li>
				<li class="calibre16">Enhance the overall security of software systems by addressing vulnerabiliti<a id="_idTextAnchor049" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>es comprehensively</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="calibre3">As we wrap <a id="_idIndexMarker083" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>up our exploration of offensive <a id="_idIndexMarker084" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>security frameworks, it is clear that tools such as MITRE ATT&amp;CK and STRIDE are invaluable. They offer security professionals structured, effective strategies for understanding and countering potential threats. Importantly, t<a id="_idTextAnchor050" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>hey help order the complexity and variety of evolving cyberattack tactics, providing a clear vision for enhancing cybersecurity defenses. Now that we have laid this solid groundwork, our next step on this cybersecurity journey involves a crucial tool of the trade. So, let us gear up and delve into setting up a Python environment tailored for tackling offensive tasks.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-35" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor051" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>Setting up a Python environment for offensive tasks</h1>
			<p class="calibre3">Let us <a id="_idIndexMarker085" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>get our hands dirty and open a terminal; we will look at how to set up a Python environment on multiple operating <a id="_idIndexMarker086" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>systems, including Linux, macOS, and Windows. We will also go through how to use Python <strong class="bold">Virtual Environments</strong> (<strong class="bold">venv</strong>) to effectively manage dependencies and isolate projects.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-36" class="calibre7"><a id="_idTextAnchor052" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>Setting up Python on Linux</h2>
			<p class="calibre3">Diving <a id="_idIndexMarker087" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>into the Linux platform, a <a id="_idIndexMarker088" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>favorite among cybersecurity professionals for its open source flexibility, you will often find Python pre-installed. However, it is crucial to verify that you have the correct Python version and that all necessary tools are set up. The following steps are designed to help you gear up your Python environment for offensive security operations on Linux:</p>
			<ol class="calibre15">
				<li class="calibre16">Open a terminal and type the following command to check whether Python is installed and to view its version:<pre class="source-code">
<strong class="bold1">python3 --version</strong></pre><p class="calibre3">Ensure that you have <em class="italic">Python 3.x</em> installed (where <em class="italic">x</em> is the minor version).</p></li>				<li class="calibre16">If Python is not already available on your system, you might need to install a specific version using the package manager corresponding to your Linux distribution.<p class="calibre3">If you <a id="_idIndexMarker089" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>are using <a id="_idIndexMarker090" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>a Debian-based system such as Ubuntu, you can get your Python installed and updated with these commands:</p><ol class="calibre19"><li class="alphabets">First, update your package lists for upgrades and new package installations using the following:</li></ol><pre class="source-code">
<strong class="bold1"> </strong><strong class="bold1">sudo apt-get update</strong></pre><ol class="calibre19"><li class="alphabets" value="2">Next, install Python version 3 using the following:</li></ol><pre class="source-code"><strong class="bold1"> </strong><strong class="bold1">sudo apt-get install python3</strong>

A virtual environment is a self-contained <strong class="bold">bubble</strong> in which <a id="_idIndexMarker093" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>you can build and run Python applications. It is separate from your system’s primary Python installation. It especially comes in handy when you are working on multiple projects with differing dependencies or need to isolate a project’s resources. Here are the steps to create one:<ol class="calibre19"><li class="alphabets">Open a terminal and navigate to your project directory.</li><li class="alphabets">Create a virtual environment using the <strong class="source-inline1">venv</strong> module (ensure you have it installed):</li></ol><pre class="source-code">

			<p class="calibre3">You <a id="_idIndexMarker094" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>have created your <a id="_idIndexMarker095" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>Python virtual environment. It is now safe to start installing packages for your project without worrying about messing up your system’s primary Python setup.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Having walked through the process of setting up Python in a Linux environment, let us not overlook macOS users. The beauty of Python and its universality implies that they, too, can enjoy the benefits of Python for offensive security tasks. Let us explore how to set this up on macOS.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-37" class="calibre7"><a id="_idTextAnchor053" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>Setting up Python on macOS</h2>
			<p class="calibre3">Just like Linux, setting up Python on macOS, another Unix-based system, follows a similar <a id="_idIndexMarker096" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>approach. The steps might differ slightly due to the unique aspects of each operating system. Let <a id="_idIndexMarker097" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>us delve into the guidelines to effectively install and configure Python on your macOS system. Follow these sequential steps for a smooth setup:</p>
			<ol class="calibre15">

Here, Python’s robust ecosystem of libraries comes into play. Each library contains a unique set of capabilities, powering our cyber arsenal to perform more precise, efficient, and diverse penetration testing tasks. Let us navigate through these essential Python libraries and how they prop up our penetration testing efforts.</p>
			<h3 class="calibre9">Scapy – crafting and analyzing network packets</h3>
			<p class="calibre3">Scapy is a <a id="_idIndexMarker106" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>powerful library <a id="_idTextAnchor059" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>for crafting <a id="_idIndexMarker107" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>and dissecting network packets, making it an invaluable tool for network penetration testers.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Here is an example:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
# Creating a Basic IC<a id="_idTextAnchor060" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre14"/>MP Ping Packet
from scapy.all import IP, ICMP, sr1
# Create an ICMP packet
packet = IP(dst="192.168.1.1") / ICMP()
# Send the packet and receive a response
response = sr1(packet)
# Print the response
Print(response)</pre>			<p class="calibre3">Here, Scapy is used to create an ICMP packet and that has been sent to the <code>192.168.1.1</code> IP.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">You can run the code by saving it to a file with the<code>.py</code> extension and then using the Python interpreter from the terminal with the <code>python3 </code><code>examplefile.py</code> command.</p>
			<h3 class="calibre9">Requests – HTTP for humans</h3>
			<p class="calibre3"><strong class="bold">Requests</strong> simplifies <a id="_idIndexMarker108" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>working <a id="_idIndexMarker109" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>with HTTP requests and responses, aiding in web application testing and vulnerability assessment.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Here is an example:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
# Sending an HTTP GET Request
import requests
url = "https://examplecode.com"
response = requests.get(url)
# Print the response content
print(response.text)</pre>			<p class="calibre3">Here, a Request <a id="_idIndexMarker110" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>module is used to create a get request to a URL and <a id="_idIndexMarker111" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>ensure that the response is printed out.</p>

			<pre class="source-code">
#  Creating a Simple TCP Client
import socket
target_host = "example.com"
target_port = 80
# Create a socket object
client = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
# Connect to the server
client.connect((target_host, target_port))
# Send data
client.send(b"GET / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: example.com\r\n\r\n")
# Receive data
response = client.recv(4096)
# Print the response
print(response)</pre>			<h3 class="calibre9">BeautifulSoup – HTML parsing and web scraping</h3>
