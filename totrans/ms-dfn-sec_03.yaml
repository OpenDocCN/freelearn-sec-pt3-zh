    words, how much data you need to recover after a disaster. However, here is the
    tricky part; even if we talk about data, that data is not measured in size but
    in time, so it is not about how many bits you recover, but to which point in time
    you must recover the data. For example, if you have an email server, then losing
    the emails received in the last hour may be acceptable, so an RPO of 1 hour is
    fine. In contrast, if you lose 1 hour of payment records, then that might not
    be acceptable. In that situation, the RPO will be between 1 and 10 seconds. In
    the following diagram, you can see the correlation between the RPO and the RTO:'

    access points that were installed on the same day. Then, you realize that one
    failed after 200 days, the second one after 400 days, and the third one after
    600 days. That means that in 1,200 days, you got three failures, so, by dividing

    restore, replace, or repair a system or device after a failure. This could be
    the time it takes your team to repair it (in-house) or the time it will take for
    the vendor to repair or replace it (based on a given SLA). The MTTR is associated
    with the impact to the business caused by the absence of that device. For example,
    replacing the hard drive in a laptop of an end user could take 3 days (to gather
    information regarding the hard drive, purchase the hard drive, and install the
    hard drive), while replacing the hard drive of a server might have a higher priority
    and the MTTR could be 1 hour (that is, the alert is received, the part is identified,
    and the part is replaced from the local inventory).

    For example, let's imagine that your web server went down twice in the last 400
    days (MTBF = 200 days) and that the MTTR was 3 hours (MTTR = 0.125 days). Therefore,
    if the device failed every 200 days and it takes 0.125 days to get it restored,
    then it means that availability is equal to `200 / (200 + 0.125)`, which means
    that, in this case, the availability of our web server is *99.9375%*.

    (for example, hot, warm, or cold), so make sure you distribute them accordingly
    to reduce costs (you don't want to host a test server on a hot site).

    DRP stated that if the secondary ISP was down, then move to ISP X. What we discovered
    during a test was that ISP X was subcontracting the services from our secondary
    ISP. This meant that a problem on the infrastructure of the secondary ISP would
    also impact ISP X, rendering our DRP useless.

    of people or services required. For example, during a test, you might check that
    you can connect to a secondary server, but does that server give you the required
    level of performance? Can it accept the number of connections that you need to
    restore the business?

    extended period of time and during different seasons. For example, you might test
    a satellite internet connection, and it could work fine if the sky is clear, but
    it might not provide you with the required level of service during cloudy weather
    or a storm.

    DRP. CTO approval is key to ensure that they agree with the technical decisions,
    CEO approval is key to ensure the DRP effectively covers the business, and CFO
    approval ensures that you have the budget required to implement and execute it.

    of the most common types of vulnerabilities to help you create the best assessment.
    Then, we expanded into one of the core aspects of cyber defense: risk management.
    Here, we learned how to manage cybersecurity risks, and also looked at one of
    the most famous frameworks in cybersecurity: the NIST Cybersecurity Framework.'
