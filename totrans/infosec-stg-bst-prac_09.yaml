    controls are effective in protecting against threats. Perhaps you think that the
    security of your organization is poor, but nobody is listening to you. In that
    circumstance, you likely don't have buy-in from Top Management, but might be able
    to get more attention and/or budget by having professionals demonstrate how a
    threat might exploit any vulnerabilities. The decision to do this isn't something

    fruit," so it's important to run these scans against your own apps and interpret
    if the results would lead to an opportunity. **Web application firewalls** are
    able to detect these activities and prevent too much information from being divulged,
