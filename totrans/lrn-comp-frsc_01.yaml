    an electronic device. There are digital cameras inside doorbells; your smartphone
    tracks your daily progress from work to home and back again; you get social media
    updates when you go to the gym, a show, or travel to a new city.

    technology. If it tracks your mundane daily activity, what about criminal or unethical
    behavior? Of course, that activity is also followed, and if you are a digital
    forensic investigator, you must know the repositories of the digital evidence
    and how to analyze it. All activity, benign or criminal, will most likely generate
    some sort of digital evidence. As an investigator, it is your job to locate all
    data of interest, process it, and present the evidence to the finder of fact.
    This chapter will introduce you to the different topics of computer-based investigations,
    from criminal acts investigated by the police to civil and potentially illegal
    actions performed by an employee, and an external third party examined by a nongovernmental
    investigator.

    What is digital forensics? It is a division of forensics involving the recovery
    and analysis of data that has been recovered from digital devices. At one time,
    the term *digital forensics* was treated as a synonym for computer forensics,
    but now it involves all devices capable of storing digital data. No matter what
    term is used, the goal is to identify, collect, and examine/analyze digital data
    while preserving its integrity. Digital forensics is not only about finding the
    artifact; it is a formal examination/analysis of the digital evidence to prove
    or disprove whether the accused committed the violation.
  prefs: []

- en: It is not always about demonstrating that the suspect is guilty; as a forensic
    examiner, you also have that ethical obligation to find **exculpatory** evidence
    that will prove the subject’s innocence. In addition, you must be an unbiased
    third party in presenting the investigation’s findings. In a criminal examination,
    your findings could deprive someone of their liberty, and in a corporate investigation,
    your findings may lead to a criminal investigation or cost someone their livelihood.
    As a digital forensic examiner, your conclusions can have an extraordinary impact
    on the subjects of the investigation.

- en: To be a digital forensic examiner, you need to have a desire to ask questions,
    have specialized equipment, and have the required training. From teaching people
    interested in the field, I have found the best students can critically examine
    the facts and circumstances being presented and, using that ability, can focus
    their efforts on efficiently reaching an accurate conclusion. Unfortunately, I
    find many students want to use a “find evidence” button, find all the artifacts,
    and print up a thousand-page report and call it a day. That is not digital forensics.
  prefs: []

- en: Digital forensics is not finding the artifact. By artifact, I am talking about
    an incriminating Google search in browser history, an incriminating email between
    the subject and a co-conspirator, and illicit images found in the filesystem.
    Artifacts are breadcrumbs leading to the identity of the person conducting the
    illegal activity. However, on their own, they do not identify the user who created
    these artifacts or the one who is responsible for their creation indirectly. One
    of the biggest challenges in this field is identifying the user who is physically
    operating the device. You want to tie the user to the specific subject, and to
    do that, you have to analyze – that is the keyword – the digital evidence to associate
    it with a particular user.

    you may lack experience in the digital field. To be an effective digital forensic
    examiner, you must be part of both those worlds. You must understand how data
    is created, shared, and saved in the digital realm and preserve that evidence
    in a forensically sound manner and be able to testify in proceedings. Sometimes,
    the ability to talk in front of a large group while answering challenging questions
    posed to you by attorneys from both sides is the hardest part of the field.

    A digital forensic examiner may investigate any alleged wrongdoing that touches
    the digital world. Nearly everyone possesses a mobile device. Sometimes, a person
    owns or uses multiple mobile devices, laptops, and the traditional desktop. All
    of these sources can maintain a significant amount of information related to the
    investigation. For example, I investigated a crime against a person where the
    victim was physically unable to communicate with the police. How does that become
    a crime that requires the use of a digital forensic examiner?

    crime via a website and instant messaging on her mobile device. So, while they
    did not directly have evidence relating to the crime being investigated, they
    had evidence about the relationship between the victim and the suspect. In the
    21st century, almost any crime may have evidence stored in a digital format. Now,
    there are some crimes where someone will have used their computer as a tool to
    commit the crime, such as sending harassing emails, fraud and forgery, hacking,
    corporate espionage, or the trafficking of illicit images. Your occupation will
    dictate your response to a situation; if you are law enforcement, you will have
    one set of procedures to follow, while if you are in the corporate world, you
    will have a different set of procedures to follow. While some processes may overlap
    in different fields, each one has its unique differences, which is what we will
    discuss next.

    moved anything, or changed anything within the crime scene. This could be a physical
    action such as applying first aid to a victim or turning a computer on or off.
    I remember an examination I did where the first responders did not reveal that
    they had accessed the victim’s computer. While conducting my examination, I did
    a timeline analysis and saw an abnormality in the activity after the victim had
    died. The abnormality was caused by the unreported actions of the first responders.
    What’s important to understand here is that the first responders’ actions were
    not wrong. What created complications was that they did not report the actions,
    which led to additional work and explanations.

    is: when two or more people agree to commit an illegal act. However, just deciding
    to commit the unlawful act is not enough; actions also have to be taken to further
    the conspiracy. What does all that mean? For the physical crime of robbery, criminal
    A contacts criminal B to discuss robbing victim C. The conversation between criminals
    A and B does not meet the statutory definition of a conspiracy. However, suppose
    criminal A paid criminal B and agreed on the amount of funds in exchange for the
    service of the robbing of victim C. In that case, we have an act in furtherance
    of the conspiracy to commit robbery. So, what crimes can the digital forensic
    investigator find within the digital realm? Almost any crime imaginable. Let’s

    been instances where the subject of an investigation was placed in the interrogation
    room, and the investigator did not recognize the suspect was wearing a smartwatch.
    While they left the subject unattended in the interrogation room, the subject
    was able to communicate with their co-conspirators and direct their efforts to
    destroy evidence and interfere with the investigation. Once the investigators
    caught on to the subject’s actions, they used the smartwatch to show the criminal
    conspiracy. They used the evidence to generate additional charges for the suspect
    in custody and their co-conspirators.

    processed the crime scene, a bracelet that was “distinctive” was found and collected

    of Thomas posing with an item similar to what was used at the crime scene. In
    a different photo, they found the “distinctive” bracelet being worn by Thomas.
