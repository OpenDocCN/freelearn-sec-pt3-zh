  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the context of cybersecurity, a vulnerability is a flaw or weakness in a
    system’s design, implementation, or configuration that could be exploited to compromise
    security. Vulnerability scanning aims to address these weaknesses. Vulnerability
    scanning is a critical practice in cybersecurity that involves the automated identification
    of potential weaknesses in systems, networks, and applications. These vulnerabilities,
    if left unaddressed, can be exploited by attackers to compromise the confidentiality,
    integrity, and availability of information systems. As organizations grow and
    their infrastructure becomes more complex, maintaining a secure environment requires
    regular and systematic scanning for vulnerabilities.

- en: Vulnerability scanning typically involves using specialized tools to probe systems
    for known vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, or outdated software. These tools
    assess the security posture of various components, such as operating systems,
    applications, network devices, and databases. They rely on vast databases of known
    vulnerabilities, often derived from sources such as the **Common Vulnerabilities
    and Exposures** ( **CVE** ) list, to identify potential security gaps.

    in the chapter. Basically, vulnerability scanning is not just about identifying
    flaws; it also helps to prioritize remediation efforts. By categorizing vulnerabilities

    the most critical issues first.
  prefs: []

    strategy. While it can identify known issues, it does not guarantee that all potential

    monitoring.
