- en: To explain, let me take you on my personal career journey. I graduated from
    college with a dual major in political science and communication, and an ambition
    to attend law school. I was accepted into law school and had obtained a scholarship
    for tuition and fees, but I was burdened financially from my undergraduate work
    and was also concerned about food, housing, healthcare, and so on. I made a decision
    to pursue a career rather than attend law school. Jobs in Northern Utah were scarce
    in the late 1980s for a graduate who didn't have a directly applicable degree,
    that is, one in accounting or medicine, and I ultimately moved to the Los Angeles
    area. I had one short-term position as an executive assistant in a medical firm,
    and then found my calling in technology.

  zh: 为了说明这一点，让我带你回顾一下我的个人职业历程。我大学毕业时主修政治学和传播学，并有志于上法学院。我被法学院录取并获得了学费和费用的奖学金，但我由于本科时的经济负担，且对食物、住房、医疗等方面感到担忧，最终决定放弃法学院，选择追求一份职业。1980年代末，北犹他州对没有直接应用专业（如会计或医学）学位的毕业生而言，工作机会十分稀缺，我最终搬到了洛杉矶地区。我曾在一家医疗公司做过一段时间的行政助理，随后找到了我在科技领域的真正兴趣。
- en: 'My calling came by way of a newspaper ad for a floor salesperson at a wage
    of $17,000 USD per annum. I knew a bit about computers—as in, I could use one—and
    I knew I could talk to people, so a career was born. I attended every vendor training
    available and was diligent in studying and developing my skills. I was fortunate
    to have two early career mentors who encouraged my success and taught me everything
    they knew. I took on assignments related to operations, sales, network architecture
    and installation, computer repair, storage, partner engagement, customer engagement,
    and so on. I learned and absorbed all I could. At the time, mainframes and mini-computers
    dominated the industry, and PCs and client-servers were becoming a thing. Storage
    systems were massive near-line devices, and the biggest concern for a CIO was
    a rogue phone line in a data center. There were very few formal CISO positions,
    and security folks were generally of two types: investigators and network professionals.
    I entered security somewhat accidentally, but according to a plan.'

  zh: 我的职业起点来自一则报纸广告，广告内容是招聘一名地面销售员，年薪为17,000美元。我对计算机略知一二——能使用计算机——而且我知道自己能与人沟通，因此我的职业生涯由此开始。我参加了所有可用的供应商培训，并且在学习和发展我的技能方面非常勤奋。我很幸运有两位早期的职业导师，他们鼓励我的成功，并教会我他们所知道的一切。我承担了与运营、销售、网络架构与安装、计算机维修、存储、合作伙伴关系、客户关系等相关的任务。我学到了很多，吸收了所有能学到的东西。当时，大型主机和小型计算机主导了行业，个人计算机和客户端-服务器系统开始崭露头角。存储系统是庞大的近线设备，首席信息官最关心的是数据中心中的一条恶意电话线。正式的CISO职位很少，安全人员通常分为两类：调查员和网络专业人员。我有些偶然地进入了安全领域，但这其实是有计划的。
- en: In 1999, I was based in Chicago and working as a healthcare specialist for Data
    General. Data General was acquired by the EMC Corporation. I explored my options
    post acquisition and decided to make a change. The change was inspired by the
    hardware token I carried for authentication. I was fascinated by the technology,
    and I pursued a company called RSA Security and was ultimately hired as a PKI
    specialist. I not only had to look up the term, I had to study and develop an
    understanding of PKI, which I did. So, in 2000, a new career began—I was still
    in tech but in a highly specialized, but very nascent, field called cybersecurity
    (InfoSec at the time). CISOs were a thing by then—in very large organizations—and
    2FA was used by about 20% of corporate employees (yes, that was all).

  zh: 1999年，我在芝加哥担任Data General的医疗保健专家。Data General被EMC公司收购。我在收购后探索了自己的选择，并决定做出改变。这一改变的灵感来自于我携带的硬件令牌用于身份验证。我对这项技术感到非常着迷，因此我开始关注一家公司——RSA
    Security，并最终被聘为PKI专家。我不仅需要查找这个术语的定义，还需要学习并理解PKI，这我做到了。于是，在2000年，一个新的职业生涯开始了——我依然在技术领域，但转向了一个高度专业化但非常初创的领域——网络安全（当时称为信息安全）。到那时，CISO职位已经存在——在一些大型组织中——而双因素认证（2FA）仅被大约20%的企业员工使用（是的，就只有这么多）。
- en: Since 2000, I have once again committed myself to self-study, learning, and
    growth—developing a deep understanding of the underlying technology of cybersecurity
    and the methods, modes, and motives of threat actors. I have also come to an understanding
    that there are simply too few people in cybersecurity roles. We used to joke,
    circa 2000, that people spent more on their annual coffee budgets than on their
    IT security budgets. If they had a firewall, a router, and an antivirus solution,
    and high-value users were using 2FA, everything was covered as far as most organizations
    were concerned. They were not prepared or adequately budgeted for the hyper growth
    in anytime, anywhere connected devices; the explosion of mobile devices that are
    as powerful as legacy servers; cloud-based technologies; the explosion of nation-state
    funded threat actors; or the explosion of malware and cybercrime as an industry.
    Universities and colleges were delayed in offering a cybersecurity-based curriculum,
    relying on a lot of network-based courses to cover the topic. Cybersecurity professionals
    were largely still from network or investigative backgrounds, and the industry
    was collapsing under the weight of too many disparate tools and too-many-point
    solutions.

    We must create a community that takes care of its members and empowers people
    to be their absolute best. We don't actually have a choice; cybercrime is here

    We can do this through investment in education programs at the grade school-level
    through to the high-school level, by investing in organizations that fund scholarships

    today, we have exactly the opposite: a tsunami of information. In the past, you
    just couldn''t really find anything; it was almost like a dark market, and now
    it is fully mainstream. I believe that today''s situation is much better from
    a self-learning perspective, as today you can easily create a lab environment
    to simulate attacks on your own machine, or in a cloud-based environment. Books
    are widely available, free online materials are usually of good quality, and there
    are far more target security certifications. So, if everything seems so good,
    why is it still so hard to start working in this field? I could give many reasons,

    is directed toward these aspects. Well-known cases such as **Carbanak**, **Mariposa**,
    and many others, where banks and their clients were directly threatened, only
    stress the need for enhanced cybersecurity in this sector. An additional problem
    is the lack of awareness of the risks posed by cyberspace. This is especially
    true for companies that are export- and import-oriented. Following investigations,

- en: I want to explain this in detail. I have been playing the **baglama** (a Turkish
    traditional musical instrument that is just like a guitar in appearance) for almost
    20 years. My parents bought a baglama for my eldest brother in order for my uncle
    to teach him how to play it. He was not willing to play the instrument, but I
    was willing to play it. Then, I started to play it by imitating my uncle's finger
    movements. I was just following the sequence of finger-presses on the frets. I
    learned a few songs to play and expanded my repertoire. My desire to play baglama
    and daily practice made me play it better. But there was a problem. In order to
    learn a new song, I was dependent on my uncle. Because if I wanted to learn a
    new song he was playing, I had to imitate his finger movements. After that, I
    noticed musical notes. A friend of my mother, who is a music teacher, taught me
    how to read notes and apply them to the baglama. I was no longer dependent on
    my uncle. I could play new songs by reading notes. After spending more time practicing,
    I was able to write notes for songs that I heard and played by myself. Years after,
    I learned the **short-neck baglama**. The one I learned to play was a **long-neck
    baglama**. A long-neck baglama has 23 frets; on the other hand, a short neck baglama
    has 19\. The chord layout is also different. At first, I thought, *I can play
    every song with my instrument, so why would I need a different one?* But after
    listening to performers using short-neck baglamas, I recognized that it was easier
    to play a song where I needed to move my fingers very quickly. I changed my mind
    and bought a short-neck baglama. The notes' positions were different, but it still
    had the same notes. The mathematics of both instruments was the same. The only
    thing I had to do was practice. Although it is not easy to play a song for the
    first time, by applying notes and doing some practice, now I can play baglama
    professionally. Now, I am almost 35 years old, and I can also play guitar, oud,
    violin, side-flute, and some percussion instruments. But I am not a professional
    player. (For the readers who do not believe me, please visit my YouTube channel

    attempt, because a human firewall has many holes. Human behavior on information
    systems is affected by age, personality, and so on, and attackers examine these
    to reach systems. This makes it easier to access systems by using human rather
    than technical processes, which shows the importance of awareness in cybersecurity.

    understanding what a network packet was, that was hard. So, I learned about network
    protocols and my career in IT took off. I have always been learning about new
    IT technologies and, as a result, I have always been ahead of the curve.

    to jokingly respond to it. I wrote back, saying *"Thanks, Dick, for the email.
    By the way, where can I find out how to do security assessments?"* I didn't expect
    any response, but life surprises you. Dick forwarded my email to the VP who had
    just set up the IT Security team in Hearndon, Virginia, to support the NSA, CIA,
    and another three initialism organizations of the US government. That VP flew

    always identified solutions that related to cybersecurity and led discussions
    with customers on those solutions. I had the knowledge and experience in this
    field, and this provided me with a lot of credibility and trust with customers,
    even though I was a sales guy! The 8 years outside of cybersecurity helped me
    to better appreciate security, since even when I was selling cloud applications
    at Google, guess what the first question would be? "*Is the cloud secure?*". When
    I would try to sell a large end-to-end network at Cisco, one of the top questions
    would be "*How do we secure* *it?*". So, no matter what role we play in the IT
    world, cybersecurity is going to be left, right, and center. My foray into the
    non-cybersecurity world made me appreciate cybersecurity even more and get a better
    idea of what customers have in mind when they say security. For some it is privacy,
    for others it is information security and governance, and for others it is even
    physical security, as in bodyguards and CCTV!

    videos, and tons of contents from cybersecurity vendors such as the *Cybersecurity
    for Dummies* free PDF from Palo Alto Networks. You can subscribe to newsletters,
    read websites such as [darkreading.com](http://darkreading.com/), and listen to
    a podcast on your way to work. Another favorite method of learning for myself
    is to talk to my colleagues and friends in the cybersecurity world and ask them
    what's the latest, what they are working on, and so forth. You learn so much from
    speaking to other people.

    vendors every day, so I am always curious to know what the latest trends are from
    them and then go back and research them online. Attending conferences and trade
    shows can be valuable as well, as long as you take the time to talk with people
    and understand what they are doing and why their solutions are important. **Always

    for a period of time and then get certified. So, it will keep you busy for days,
    weeks, or months, but then it is over and it will have been time and effort well
    spent. In terms of security training, those are usually very expensive, so if
    you get a chance to attend one sponsored by your company, make sure you do. Even
    if you believe you won''t learn a lot of new things, you only need to learn a
    few new things. If you come out knowing 10 percent more than you did before attending
    the course, that is amazing! 10 percent more in 4-5 days! However, if you are
    technical or training to be in the technical field of cybersecurity, then nothing
    beats hands-on experience at work. Offer your services for free if you are a student,
    just so you can learn. When I was at university—a long time ago—I worked for free
    at a computer shop, just to learn how to take PCs apart and put them together,
    and then set them up again. I learned more in the first few weeks on the job than
    all the reading I had done in the past 5 years!'

    is catching an Uber to work, getting your car refueled, watching a TV show, or
    walking into your house. All these services will need to be secured, and attackers

    network myself before even seeking any external help. So, I learned ethical hacking
    and got myself certified by the EC Council. Then, I trained my team and secured
    the network before launching the application. I found the career to be very challenging,

    assistance of IT masters at CSU, who announced my success at winning the MISS
    award for the highest graduating grade point average, to a wide pool of potential

    were still in their infancy and it would be better to study a traditional engineering
    degree to better secure my career. Accordingly, I picked electrical and electronics
    engineering as the closest path to technology that would allow me to switch later

    (Microsoft Certified System Engineer) with Networking Essentials. In those days,

    controlling information, as this has always been paramount. It needs no examples.
    Since the early days of the computer's existence, the need for securing the information
    they manage has been brought forward and has gone through an evolutionary process
    in the way we secure information and the mechanisms that handle and process information.
    One of the oldest examples that we can look at is the way the Roman dictator Julius
    Caesar secured his message transmissions. He used a form of transmitting encrypted
    information to his generals on the battlefield, which was impossible to decode
    by his enemies at the time. This method would eventually be known as the Caesar
    cipher, which is possibly the oldest known code. It was a substitution cipher.

    everyone wanted to make use of the new technologies, including individual citizens,
    governments, businesses, and especially the military. The telegraph/telephony
    and radio proved to be the most beneficial pieces of equipment that the military
    could have, from then until now. Even though these systems solved one of the major
    gaps in inter-personal communications, they had a major flaw in their design:
    the communication lines of telegraphs and telephones, and radio communication,
    could be tapped into and messages intercepted. This gave rise to the need to encrypt
    lines and radio communication, especially for the military.'

    was a dire need for a strong mechanism to secure data before, during, and after
    transmission, so that even if radio signals were intercepted, which was a very
    common thing for the opposition to do, it couldn't be decrypted. This dire need
    then gave rise to the most complex data security method, with the help of available
    technology during the war. This machine was known as **Enigma**.

    typing a message, and used an electromechanical rotary mechanism to encrypt and
    decrypt messages before and after transmission; originally, these were devices
    for banks to perform the secure transfer of financial data, but the Germans started
    using it for all their war-time communications to send encrypted messages to their
    troops in the field. Just to give you a scale, Enigma had about 150 trillion possible
    combinations with a poly-alphabetic substitution cipher, meaning that a single
    alphabet would go through substitution multiple times to finally arrive at a substitution
    alphabet, and the same had to be reversed to get the original alphabet. This technology
    was literally causing the allies a lot of trouble to keep up with the war, and
    they were desperate to break the Enigma code. There were various attempts and
    various research done at the time to break the code. But eventually, it was broken
    by Alan Turing, in 1941, which shortened the war by 2 years. Alan Turing is also
    known as *the Father of Artificial Intelligence*.

    and so did security concerns; at that time, security was only focused on physical
    systems and making sure no unauthorized personnel had access to them. Basically,
    locking down physical devices and systems, and only allowing certain authorized
    persons to access them physically was more important. But this scenario soon changed
    with changes in the technology landscape. Our early computers were single-user
    systems, and later, computers became multi-user systems that could be remotely
    accessed, which made security professionals rethink the approach toward the overall
    security of access to applications and networks by users. This gave birth to the
    concept of authentication—to access files based on the user and their need. This
    concept led to the possibility of a shared system. But this concept had a flaw,
    because it needed to be configured properly to give the right permissions to the
    right person, otherwise information leakage could occur.

    and other, newer client-server models, it was obvious that these systems were
    getting connected over the telephone network. This connectivity requirement was
    one of the main reasons why ARPANET, our early internet, came into existence in
    1973\. Even though, in the beginning, it only connected just a few universities,

    and systems were appearing so fast that sometimes developers and engineers overlooked,
    or perhaps underestimated, the need to build them secure from the beginning. A
    whole new community of enthusiasts, individuals with good and bad intentions,
    started to come into existence, and they started breaking applications and systems
    where they could find any gaps or flaws, sometimes to prove their point that applications
    were weak, or sometimes just for personal financial gain by misusing a system
    or the data captured. The requirement to secure information systems was realized

    its own perimeter security challenges. Suddenly, it was also evident that there
    was a gap in security architectures and that information could be exposed. Once
    again, military concepts helped, building virtual boundaries with a certain set
    of rules built into systems guarding the boundaries; whom to allow, whom not to
    allow. Basically, the focus was to position a gatekeeper around a corporate network
    boundary and interact via that gatekeeper with other outside organizations. This
    was named a firewall. These devices were simple packet-filtering appliances. The
    earliest firewalls, commonly known as first-generation firewalls, would often
    block or allow traffic by inspecting TCP/IP packets, based on the filtering rules
    defined on the firewalls.

    destination port numbers; it could even be a combination of those together. Slowly,
    firewalls made progress and evolved generation by generation. The following generations
    of firewalls brought in features such as application layer filtering; application-level
    firewalls will typically examine the stream of data rather than just the TCP/IP
    packets. These allowed the making of advanced-level decisions to act on packets
    when they were passing through these devices. Because first-generation firewalls
    never inspected application-level data streams, they were vulnerable to certain
    attacks and backdoors. Application firewalls can now be configured to inspect
    some known vulnerabilities and stop them.

    recent attacks have been successful in bypassing existing security solutions,
    traditional or advanced. These attacks were successful because they were able
    to hide within the legitimate realm of our network and infrastructure. Our current
    security solutions are designed to detect threats based on scanning for known
    issues, filtering, or dropping bad actors, or even trying to monitor identity
    and user habits, and so on, but these things are not able to deter attacks. The
    primary reason is that these are still focused on reacting to a security event,
    responding to the security findings of security events that have happened, and
    lastly, planning for how to recover from them. In other words, its a **reactive
    security response***.* A reactive response is good, but does not hold ground to
    a level where it can compete with the advanced attacks of today. We need to redirect
    our focus toward a **proactive security response**, and the industry today is
    moving from a reactive to proactive security response already. This is a paradigm
    shift in security frameworks and methodologies on how we predict, analyze, and
    respond to threats. Unlike in a reactive form of security response, proactive
    methodologies provide greater in-depth visibility into the attack infrastructure.
    Simply put, a proactive method is to approach from an attacker's view of the attack
    surface and try to predict attacks in advance and apply proper measures.

    and when there is an attack,* *the systems and security analysts will respond
    to it."* It's about laying a trap with known attack parameters and methods and
    waiting for the monitoring and detection systems to react to it. In a reactive
    form, the attention is always given to form a strong perimeter defense to thwart
    attacks that attempt to penetrate the network. This form of security is very much
    localized to the business unit and its activities, and it does not take advantage
    of attacks of a similar nature, against another business or industry verticals.
    Reactive security does not provide a 360° view of the threat landscape but a reactive
    way of achieving security operations is always simpler, faster to bring up, and
    has lower operational costs. Reactive security monitoring can be further enhanced
    with data feeds from antivirus detection systems, vulnerability scanners, and,
    at times, DLP systems. The flip side of such a model is that it will always react
    to security detection after a breach or compromise has occurred.

    an intelligence-driven model, where the system is enriched with actionable intelligence
    data, from multiple internal and external sources, working in line with existing
    real-time monitoring systems. This proactive method will have visibility of the
    entire threat landscape and all phases of the cyber kill chain, and not just focus
    on one or partial phases of the kill chain. One of the key aspects of proactive
    security is threat hunting, which allows analysts to get more insights into the
    network and systems by trying to uncover any anomalies, or any abnormal changes
    in network behavior, any presence of known bad files in the systems, or maybe
    there are some registry entries that can be found from previously known attacks.
    As an analyst, you can also look for known **indicators of compromise** (**IOCs**)
    in the network. Threat hunting is a continuous process and will always involve
    trying to look for a new set of information as received from threat intelligence
    sources. Threat hunting can also be done automatically by looking into network
    behavior, system anomalies, timeline analysis of certain events, looking into
    the baseline data of the network and the system for a period, and so on.

    to secure it. Sensitiveness toward data is at an all-time high. In our efforts
    to keep data safe and be proactive in detecting any threats toward it, we must
    have proper and effective threat intelligence in place. Threat intelligence can
    be achieved by acquiring specific threat information (intelligence) about various
    systems, processes, networks, applications, perimeter defense mechanisms, and
    other IT assets. This data is then collected, analyzed, and enriched to provide
    proactive and actionable threat intelligence. One of the reasons threat intelligence
    is so important is because current threats are highly sophisticated and difficult
    to detect. We must acquire very specific information and perform a search for
    signs of compromise with actionable content from any threat intel source. To stay

    systems with proper threat data.

    and categorize threat information in real time to produce actionable threat intelligence
    for the SIEM and incident response systems to analyze and correlate the collected
    threat information with the security alerts and events it is monitoring. These
    threat alerts from the threat intel system will also empower SOC professionals
    to create custom signatures for further detection. Threat intelligence systems
    gather various pieces of information related to incidents, events, logs, security
    vulnerabilities, recent and past known attack data, detection data from the security
    and network devices of the organization, along with information from external
    threat feeds. You can also set up a honey pot system to collect attack information
    and use it as threat data. All data collection needs to be focused and meaningful
    for the organization that intends to use it, because every business is different,
    with distinct needs and types of infrastructure. For threat intelligence to be
    effective, the collection of intelligence data must be done in a centralized manner,
    as systems collect threats and vulnerability information from a wide range of
    locations and devices to correlate data. You must collect data from both internal
    and external sources, as both combined will provide more detailed information
    on threats and attack vectors, specific to your industry or organization. Also,
    focus on collecting information about any ongoing global attack and its attack
    vectors, related mitigation instructions and detection parameters from agencies
    such as government CERT, NIST, ENISA, and so on, along with industry sources,
    Cisco, Symantec, McAfee, Microsoft, RSA, and other major vendors. You may also
    focus on open source threat intel such as OSINT, SANS Internet Storm Center, and
    Open Threat Exchange. All this collected threat information needs to be properly
    categorized and segregated based on threat types, and its importance to the business
    entity and function; it could be, for example, based on the geolocation of the
    business unit, the business applications you are using, and IT infrastructures.
    Geolocation is important from the perspective of identifying where the threat
    actually originated so that you can have more of a focus on those business locations
    of yours as a priority, as they may have been affected; this could also help establish
    whether it is a targeted attack toward your organization, or maybe a country.
    This scenario can help you pinpoint the most effected business function, application,
    or unit, and gives you room for remediation in advance, or at least on time, before
    it's too late. It will also help in defining proper mitigation and a detection
    strategy to focus on the proper utilization of resources since it is always limited,
    irrespective of the size of the organization.

    and central monitoring platform. Traditionally, we have always used SIEM as a
    platform that receives information from the rest of the network, as we mentioned
    earlier in this chapter, to correlate and identify threats and security incidents.
    In essence, SIEM has always acted like a device that listens but doesn't say a
    word. However, with today's cybersecurity scenarios, it is prudent for SIEM to
    take a much larger part in the whole process, to say things and collaborate in
    taking action. One prominent activity that SIEM can be tasked with is integrating
    with digital forensic platforms to receive more rich and tactical information
    in real time. Digital evidence, by nature, is extremely volatile, and this also
    drives the response time for any security incident. This fragile and crucial nature
    of digital evidence in any cybersecurity incident forces us to approach the problem
    in a fully automated way. This calls for an automated way of collecting digital
    evidence from a suspected device, and we should do it right on time and integrate
    this telemetry with SIEM to trigger the collection of evidence from endpoints,
    just like a security camera starts recording the actions of a criminal with the
    help of a motion sensor. This, in turn, provides us with detailed information
    about what took place and also provides us with more accurate evidence that is
    collected at the right time—*the time when the incident took place, and not later*.
    By capturing the state of a compromised machine right after it provides shell
    access to cyber criminals, providing an initial analysis of the collected evidence,
    and making everything ready for a deep dive investigation, will help us turn the
    tables on the bad guys. Actually, this is only the beginning; we should also develop
    systems/platforms that will automatically analyze collected evidence and enrich
    this with threat intelligence to gain speed and accuracy.

    It was easy to fix security issues, as they were all so steady. But in the current
    situation, technology is moving faster than ever, and we in the security profession
    are always playing catch-up. By the time we do catch up with the latest technology
    and understand how to secure it, the technology moves on again. This scenario
    is not going to change; rather, this will become the norm for the future. To some
    extent, as per many industry experts and analysts, who track changes in the industry,
    this gap in cybersecurity is also because of the gender gap. It is estimated that
    the ratio between the male and female workforce in the cybersecurity industry
    could be 8.5: 1.5\. Filling the gender gap could certainly help fulfill the need
    of the hour, but this is not the only area that can solve this issue. We also
    need to involve more and more ex-military personnel. Veterans don''t need to be
    taught the essence and importance of security; its hardwired into them already,
    by design, and cybersecurity concepts are still being driven from military terms
    and best practices. Also, the gap could be filled to some extent by retraining
    professionals from fields other than IT.'

    technology skills, know how the web works, how applications work, how system administration
    is done, and what the security standards are that govern security policies (at
    a very basic level). I often hear that, if someone wants to start in cybersecurity,
    then they need to have very strong technical skills in certain areas, but given
    the situation today with the skills and the talent gap, I think it's illogical
    not to ramp up others, too. Security is not just one person's, or one group of
    security specialists' job; it's the job of everyone to know about cybersecurity
    and to contribute in whatever way they can. So, the skills required for cybersecurity
    can be built over a period of time. I am not saying that someone can become an
    expert in a few weeks, or months, but if someone chooses to be in the domain,
    or make this their career, then they can start at the level they are currently
    at and grow from there. Gradually, they will become experts over a period of time.

    key verticals of the cybersecurity ecosystem. The process of VA/PT assures organizations
    and security researchers that their information systems are up to date and are
    not exposed to any critical security risks. VA/PT also helps you to be proactive
    in finding security threats and risks before attackers do. The VA/PT stream is
    very exciting and is a highly hands-on field. Apart from security consulting firms
    and big corporations, currently, many product development organizations also have
    their own teams for VA/PT as part of their product security teams. VA/PT researchers
    use various scanning tools to scan the network, applications, and/or other IT
    assets, such as servers during these scanning activities and try to find as many
    vulnerabilities as possible that could be exploited by attackers. Scripting knowledge
    can be very useful here, because, as a researcher, you can then develop your own

    am sure you will not be disappointed. Digital forensics is based on recovering
    lost data, investigations, and the collection of evidence and materials found
    on digital devices. DF is done in most cases where computer crime is involved,
    and you must prove a crime or theft. DF can be done on any computer assets, such
    as workstations, servers, mobile devices, and network devices. You need to be
    extremely careful while performing DF, as you not only have to find evidence but
    must also ensure its safekeeping, integrity, and sensitiveness, as this evidence
    may be used in a court of law by the appropriate body or legal team. The current
    industry standard is to have dedicated digital forensics team or analysts. During
    DF, proper instructions or orders are followed to acquire evidence from a machine
    or from the cloud. If you are planning to be a forensic investigator in the digital
    world, one of the skills that you have to focus on is the process of transferring
    and preserving artifacts after you have collected them. It''s very important to
    maintain a chain of custody to ensure that evidence is not tampered with; otherwise,

    with a walkie-talkie, a hat, and your own shopping mall to patrol. If you had
    said you wanted to work in cybersecurity, you probably would have received a nice

    tasked with working security <q>“front of house”</q> in those shopping malls are
    invisibly supported by those working in cybersecurity <q>“back of house”</q>.
    This ensures that the shops and services are as protected from the casual shoplifter
    as they are to the professional cybercriminal. The infamous case of the retailer
    Target being hacked in 2013 resulted in a reported loss of $148 million, and nothing

    products, but as the very fabric on which every organization builds its technology.
    DDLS is a training partner with Microsoft, Google Cloud, AWS, and Red Hat; all
    of these vendors build fantastic, secure products, which someone has to design,
    deploy, and manage securely. The point here is that cybersecurity isn't separate

    cloud services to their business.  It is way beyond the scope of this section to

    is easy to compromise. Of course, that hands on stream includes security appliances
    such as Checkpoint, end point security such as Trend, and network security built
    into Cisco products. Only after we have thought about the proper opportunity to
    manage security can we start to think about the more generic cybersecurity training,

    company runs when the company database hits the internet. I see these roles as
    ones not engaging in the technical aspects of implementing cybersecurity. Consider
    them as an analyst role, perhaps tasked with analyzing and assessing vulnerabilities
    in the infrastructure. This investigates tools and countermeasures to remedy the
    detected vulnerabilities, and recommends solutions and best practices. They also
    test for compliance with security policies and procedures. The infrastructure
    in this example includes software, hardware, networks, and people. Therefore,
    it is easy to see that it would be hard to have domain level expertise across
    every discipline.  You would need the support of someone with hands on skills
    in Cisco or AWS. Hopefully it''s clear that providing a prescriptive view of who
    is who in the cybersecurity zoo isn''t possible. Therefore, here is some homework
    for you: use tools such as LinkedIn and job seeking websites of choice and check

    there are training courses and certifications that are mapped to a product. A
    Checkpoint Security certification is really valuable if you support Checkpoint
    devices; the same rules apply to cloud platforms and networking hardware. You
    can bet on Cisco as it's very dominate, but if your dream job is for an organization
    that has built its networking on top of Huawei hardware, Cisco skills are suddenly
    less relevant . However, they are still usable and concepts tend not to change,
    just the way the technology deals with it does. There are of course other training
    courses and certifications that are not vendor-specific. These courses tend to
    be more portable. The concept of what a denial of service attack is is the same
    irrespective of your choices of IT vendor.

    Bond-style three-digit manual bag as a birthday gift. He used to hide his secret
    stuff inside the bag, and one day I realized he had something really interesting
    in his bag, and I wanted to get access to it. Of course, my brother was not that
    keen on me having access to his bag. So, to cut a long story short, after running
    a manual password attack, which, of course, took me a while since I had to write
    every single combination down, within weeks I was able to open his bag. My reward
    was his magazines; as a nine-year-old boy, having access to those kinds of magazines
    made me the most popular boy in my primary school.

    on to IT consulting and sharing my insight with my clients from all organizations
    showed me the biggest gaps in IT departments. So, I decided to move toward information

    centers as a part-time tutor, teaching many Microsoft and security courses. That
    led to me opening my own training company, where I had only one room, and at the
    same time I was still working somewhere else as a full-time IT professional. Finally,
    in 2006, I quit my full-time job and started to work for myself, where I grew
    the business into a multi-branch training company. Within a few years, the business
    grew from a one-room training center to a multi-million dollar business with branches
    all across Australia.

    ago; back then, for us to be able to learn, we had to go to libraries, borrow
    books (if we were lucky, as not too many IT books are in libraries), but, today,
    blogs, computer-based training, YouTube, and classroom-based training is much
    easier to reach and much more affordable. So, to keep it short, even if you cannot
