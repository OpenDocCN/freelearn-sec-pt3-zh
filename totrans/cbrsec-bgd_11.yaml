    should be trivialized or over-hyped either. We are facing a battle against cybercrime
    that is impacting all aspects of our lives, including governments, financial systems,
    food supplies, water supplies, critical infrastructure, and healthcare. Large-scale
    cyber events, such as those witnessed in the past several years, threaten our
    very way of life. So, the question becomes, how did we get here? More importantly,
    where do we go from here? What can you, as a candidate, do to pursue a career
    in cybersecurity?

- en: To explain, let me take you on my personal career journey. I graduated from
    college with a dual major in political science and communication, and an ambition
    to attend law school. I was accepted into law school and had obtained a scholarship
    for tuition and fees, but I was burdened financially from my undergraduate work
    and was also concerned about food, housing, healthcare, and so on. I made a decision
    to pursue a career rather than attend law school. Jobs in Northern Utah were scarce
    in the late 1980s for a graduate who didn't have a directly applicable degree,
    that is, one in accounting or medicine, and I ultimately moved to the Los Angeles
    area. I had one short-term position as an executive assistant in a medical firm,
    and then found my calling in technology.

    of $17,000 USD per annum. I knew a bit about computers—as in, I could use one—and
    I knew I could talk to people, so a career was born. I attended every vendor training
    available and was diligent in studying and developing my skills. I was fortunate
    to have two early career mentors who encouraged my success and taught me everything
    they knew. I took on assignments related to operations, sales, network architecture
    and installation, computer repair, storage, partner engagement, customer engagement,
    and so on. I learned and absorbed all I could. At the time, mainframes and mini-computers
    dominated the industry, and PCs and client-servers were becoming a thing. Storage
    systems were massive near-line devices, and the biggest concern for a CIO was
    a rogue phone line in a data center. There were very few formal CISO positions,
    and security folks were generally of two types: investigators and network professionals.
    I entered security somewhat accidentally, but according to a plan.'

    General. Data General was acquired by the EMC Corporation. I explored my options
    post acquisition and decided to make a change. The change was inspired by the
    hardware token I carried for authentication. I was fascinated by the technology,
    and I pursued a company called RSA Security and was ultimately hired as a PKI
    specialist. I not only had to look up the term, I had to study and develop an
    understanding of PKI, which I did. So, in 2000, a new career began—I was still
    in tech but in a highly specialized, but very nascent, field called cybersecurity
    (InfoSec at the time). CISOs were a thing by then—in very large organizations—and
    2FA was used by about 20% of corporate employees (yes, that was all).

    growth—developing a deep understanding of the underlying technology of cybersecurity
    and the methods, modes, and motives of threat actors. I have also come to an understanding
    that there are simply too few people in cybersecurity roles. We used to joke,
    circa 2000, that people spent more on their annual coffee budgets than on their
    IT security budgets. If they had a firewall, a router, and an antivirus solution,
    and high-value users were using 2FA, everything was covered as far as most organizations
    were concerned. They were not prepared or adequately budgeted for the hyper growth
    in anytime, anywhere connected devices; the explosion of mobile devices that are
    as powerful as legacy servers; cloud-based technologies; the explosion of nation-state
    funded threat actors; or the explosion of malware and cybercrime as an industry.
    Universities and colleges were delayed in offering a cybersecurity-based curriculum,
    relying on a lot of network-based courses to cover the topic. Cybersecurity professionals
    were largely still from network or investigative backgrounds, and the industry
    was collapsing under the weight of too many disparate tools and too-many-point
    solutions.

    we want diverse backgrounds and skills, and we have too many job openings; we
    want to reduce complexity, but we continue to hire the same profiles, bemoan the

    In addition, our tooling must modernize. We must fully realize the capabilities

    we see daily. We must also operate in partnership with public organizations, private

    we must have the will to accept that change is needed. We must have the will to
    hire a wide variety of people from diverse educational and societal backgrounds.
    We must create a community that takes care of its members and empowers people
    to be their absolute best. We don't actually have a choice; cybercrime is here
    to stay. What is needed now is a cybersecurity industry that acts as a community
    to bring the best tools, people, and partnering together as a robust solution.
    We can do this through investment in education programs at the grade school-level
    through to the high-school level, by investing in organizations that fund scholarships
    and mentorship programs for diverse individuals, through programs that invest
    in training transitioning military members and retraining displaced workers. We
    can actually bring cybersecurity to the broader population by simplifying the
    lexicon of the industry and making it less intimidating. We can mentor broadly,
    and we can speak publicly and frequently on the need for change and the steps

    so far, little attention has been paid to the potential of AI to address labor
    and human rights issues. However, it is clear that AI will have a real impact

    This concern has prompted discussions about the accountability and transparency
    of algorithms. And there have been efforts to understand how to mitigate the potentially
    discriminatory and unfair decisions of algorithms in a range of important areas
    of life, such as, say, applying for a bank loan or seeking justice.

    After 2 years of gaining expertise at Coslat, Ozan transferred his shares to perform
    a new venture, leaving Coslat active in business with over 2,000 customers. Ozan
    continued his career at the BGA Information Security Academy as a manager, where

    forensics, and incident response. With his experience and success in the cybersecurity
    business and markets, which gave him the opportunity to strictly follow the trends

    network administrators. However, to be a cybersecurity specialist, you do not
    have to have these backgrounds; anyone with the skills and experience can build
    a career in cybersecurity. For instance, to start a career in cybersecurity, you
    don't have to have a computer programming degree. Nevertheless, you need both
    experience and certification for a business career. Businesses are aware of the
    need to have skilled employees when hiring, so they give great importance to certifications
    on cybersecurity as one way of picking their candidates.

    certifications. However, gaining hands-on experience through a job is more important,
    as people experience theoretical assumptions on a practical level, which will
    yield more perspicacity than certifications will deliver. Thus, as I mentioned
    earlier, to start a career in cybersecurity, taking an internship or volunteering
    for an organization is necessary.

    Big financial organizations will be targets because they are accessible from every
    location in the world, and an attacker with the motivation of financial gain can
    attack from a distance. Also, governments will be at risk from enemy states who
    could launch cyber attacks anonymously on institutions of the target country to

    have a good mix of students who are already in the market and ones who are brand
    new. What they have in common is that they are all pursuing a university-level
    degree in the field. I'm truly a believer in studying to your foundational knowledge
    about something, and getting credentials to validate your skills; credentials
    will be the most useful in this market. Keep in mind that credentials via certification
    or degrees do not give any guarantees that you will rapidly get a promotion (if
    you are already in the field) or a job in the field. What you need to understand
    and focus on is that there are things you have control over (pursuing a better
    education in the field) and things that you don't have control over (getting a
    job, for example). By doing your homework, you increase the likelihood of a positive
    outcome, so make sure you do your homework!

    should take, how to choose it, and the generalist/specialist dilemma, it is important
    to build your security foundation. If you are new to this area and you want to
    know what you should learn about security, the best advice is to obtain a vendor-neutral
    certification, such as CompTIA Security+. The current exam (SY0-501) is very broad,
    because it covers subjects such as BYOD, SCADA, Incident Response, and other topics
    that are relevant for anyone who wants to either start working in security or
    boost their security career by obtaining a vendor-neutral certification.

- en: One of the advantages of starting with a broad certification in the security
    field is that you can decide which area you want to focus on in if you want to
    specialize in something; for example, after obtaining this certification, you
    might conclude that you want to invest more time and effort into becoming a computer
    forensics analyst. If that's your choice, you could start with **GIAC** **Certified
    Forensic Analyst** (**GCFA**) or EC-Council's **C|HFI** (**Computer-Hacking Forensics
    Investigator**). The reasons that will lead you to choose one certification over
    another can vary; it could be job requirements, financial restrictions, and so
    on. It is important to research and to verify what certification will aggregate
    more valuenot only on your resume, but also your own knowledge. What you learn
    throughout the preparation phase is vital, because if you are going to spend hours
    and hours studying for an exam, you better like the subject and be very passionate
    about what you are about to embrace.

    anything you do in life, progressing in this field becomes easier if you are passionate,
    self-driven, and have discipline to pursue your vision of what you want for your
    career. Make sure that you participate and network with other professionals, because
    this will help you to identify areas that you can explore further and will offer
    real-world scenarios that you might not be exposed to if you are working on your

    jets and tomahawks that were flying across the Balkan sky daily, praying the given
    coordinates were precise, guiding the tomahawks to the right targets. I took my
    first steps in the field of security at the Military Academy General Mihailo Apostolski,
    Skopje, Macedonia, studying aviation. As the first generation that was trained
    and educated according to NATO standards, luck turned its back on us. Due to the
    transition of the army and security structures, the entire generation of graduated
    lieutenants changed course from the military to civilian life. I started studying
    political science at the Iustinianus Primus Faculty of Law at the University of
    St. Cyril and Methodius in Skopje, where, in 2011, I successfully defended my
    doctoral dissertation in the field of politics and security. Earlier, in 2008,
    I started my career as an independent intelligence officer in the Financial Intelligence
    Office, a position I'm still active in today. My main duty is to analyze suspicious
    transactions related to money laundering and terrorism financing, as well as the
    implementation of international restrictive measures. Within the scope of my duties,
    I am a member of the National Committee for Countering Violent Extremism and Counter-Terrorism

    generate proceeds of crime has imposed the need for its study. Only through such
    an approach can you understand the psychology of criminals, why and for what purposes
    they use cyberspace, what methods of attacks they use, and how they choose their
    targets. Naturally, I started independently by studying legislation, researching
    the norms and standards, as well as investigating cyber crime cases. I have to
    admit, the internet has played a major role in this. Afterwards, together with
    my esteemed friends, associates, and colleagues, we established the **Cybersecurity
    Corporate Security and Crisis Management Initiative** (**C3I**) in Skopje, through
    which we accomplished several projects concerned with building a cyber resilient
    society. C3I started cooperating with private institutions, especially financial
    institutions, through education and printing instruction materials intended for
    clients in order to inform them about the risks and threats of cyber crime and
    ways to protect themselves. There is a saying that if you are not able to share
    your knowledge outside, then you will not be able to share it at home either.
    I was elected an honorary member of the nonprofit organization Cyber ​​Security
    Research Center – Global in Istanbul, Turkey, which is a unique research center
    focusing on the effects of cybersecurity threats on societies. For 4 years, I

    in which criminals utilize them for their illicit and illegal activities. Among
    these technologies, digital currencies are transforming the criminal underworld.
    They are also a powerful new tool for criminals and terrorist financiers to convert,
    remit, and conceal illicit funds from law enforcement authorities. There is a
    clear consensus that digital currencies pose a money laundering and terrorism
    financing threat. A small number of cases have already shown law enforcement agencies
    that money laundering and terrorism financing can easily take place inside virtual
    environments, offering high levels of anonymity and low levels of detection, removing
    many of the risks associated with real-world money laundering and terrorism financing
    activities. On the other hand, the introduction and distribution of new products
    into the banking system is an open field where criminals have found a solution
    to commit criminal activities and abuse.

    and users of e-banking services are internet fraud, harmful software, **Advanced
    Persistent Threat** (**APT**), payment card fraud, and DDoS attacks on critical
    financial information infrastructure. These actions represent offenses in which
    the offender may acquire illegal profit. In order to conceal the source of illegal
    property (usually in the form of cash), the perpetrator puts the cash into the
    financial system and pursues a process of money laundering. The role of public
    and private partnership, which means cooperation between the private sector and
    law enforcement, is of great importance in the early detection of suspicious persons
    or transactions that deviate from daily operations. A public-private partnership
    must set up an ambush. They wait for terrorists and their supporters to make the
    smallest mistakes in order to reveal their identity and purpose. We always need
    luck to not get hacked, but hackers need it only once to break into a system.

    is directed toward these aspects. Well-known cases such as **Carbanak**, **Mariposa**,
    and many others, where banks and their clients were directly threatened, only
    stress the need for enhanced cybersecurity in this sector. An additional problem
    is the lack of awareness of the risks posed by cyberspace. This is especially

    traditional musical instrument that is just like a guitar in appearance) for almost
    20 years. My parents bought a baglama for my eldest brother in order for my uncle
    to teach him how to play it. He was not willing to play the instrument, but I
    was willing to play it. Then, I started to play it by imitating my uncle's finger
    movements. I was just following the sequence of finger-presses on the frets. I
    learned a few songs to play and expanded my repertoire. My desire to play baglama
    and daily practice made me play it better. But there was a problem. In order to
    learn a new song, I was dependent on my uncle. Because if I wanted to learn a
    new song he was playing, I had to imitate his finger movements. After that, I
    noticed musical notes. A friend of my mother, who is a music teacher, taught me
    how to read notes and apply them to the baglama. I was no longer dependent on
    my uncle. I could play new songs by reading notes. After spending more time practicing,
    I was able to write notes for songs that I heard and played by myself. Years after,
    I learned the **short-neck baglama**. The one I learned to play was a **long-neck
    baglama**. A long-neck baglama has 23 frets; on the other hand, a short neck baglama
    has 19\. The chord layout is also different. At first, I thought, *I can play
    every song with my instrument, so why would I need a different one?* But after
    listening to performers using short-neck baglamas, I recognized that it was easier
    to play a song where I needed to move my fingers very quickly. I changed my mind
    and bought a short-neck baglama. The notes' positions were different, but it still
    had the same notes. The mathematics of both instruments was the same. The only
    thing I had to do was practice. Although it is not easy to play a song for the
    first time, by applying notes and doing some practice, now I can play baglama
    professionally. Now, I am almost 35 years old, and I can also play guitar, oud,
    violin, side-flute, and some percussion instruments. But I am not a professional
    player. (For the readers who do not believe me, please visit my YouTube channel

    spent 6 years in a cybersecurity-focused role. I then moved into a sales role
    with less focus on cybersecurity. I then moved back into a cybersecurity-focused
    sales role after an 8-year gap. However, throughout those 8 years, I was always
    passionate about cybersecurity, and even when working for Cisco and Google, I
    always identified solutions that related to cybersecurity and led discussions
    with customers on those solutions. I had the knowledge and experience in this
    field, and this provided me with a lot of credibility and trust with customers,
    even though I was a sales guy! The 8 years outside of cybersecurity helped me
    to better appreciate security, since even when I was selling cloud applications
    at Google, guess what the first question would be? "*Is the cloud secure?*". When
    I would try to sell a large end-to-end network at Cisco, one of the top questions
    would be "*How do we secure* *it?*". So, no matter what role we play in the IT
    world, cybersecurity is going to be left, right, and center. My foray into the
    non-cybersecurity world made me appreciate cybersecurity even more and get a better
    idea of what customers have in mind when they say security. For some it is privacy,
    for others it is information security and governance, and for others it is even
    physical security, as in bodyguards and CCTV!

    to focus. Cybersecurity is definitely a very wide domain these days. I would strongly
    urge you to get a holistic understanding, not very deep, across the domains and
    then choose one area to focus on and go deep into that area. The area you choose
    might be related to the solutions you are working on now, or that you want to
    work on in the future. But you can never learn one area in isolation. If you want
    to focus on IoT cybersecurity, as an example, you cannot just learn IoT cybersecurity
    and that's it. You will need to understand a lot about cybersecurity at a high
    level, and in some areas even at a deeper level, before tackling IoT. And the
    beauty with learning is that you don't have to stop there—you can learn more and
    learn different things. So, after a few years in IoT cybersecurity, you might
    decide that you want to do ethical hacking for the next few years. Put your learning
    hat on, leverage everything you have learned so far, and build on top of it.

    either at home or at the office, and attending courses after hours and during

    controlling information, as this has always been paramount. It needs no examples.
    Since the early days of the computer's existence, the need for securing the information
    they manage has been brought forward and has gone through an evolutionary process
    in the way we secure information and the mechanisms that handle and process information.
    One of the oldest examples that we can look at is the way the Roman dictator Julius
    Caesar secured his message transmissions. He used a form of transmitting encrypted
    information to his generals on the battlefield, which was impossible to decode
    by his enemies at the time. This method would eventually be known as the Caesar
    cipher, which is possibly the oldest known code. It was a substitution cipher.

    everyone wanted to make use of the new technologies, including individual citizens,
    governments, businesses, and especially the military. The telegraph/telephony
    and radio proved to be the most beneficial pieces of equipment that the military
    could have, from then until now. Even though these systems solved one of the major
    gaps in inter-personal communications, they had a major flaw in their design:
    the communication lines of telegraphs and telephones, and radio communication,
    could be tapped into and messages intercepted. This gave rise to the need to encrypt
    lines and radio communication, especially for the military.'

    to the substitution cipher, and they were easily breakable by cryptanalysts. There
    was a dire need for a strong mechanism to secure data before, during, and after
    transmission, so that even if radio signals were intercepted, which was a very
    common thing for the opposition to do, it couldn't be decrypted. This dire need
    then gave rise to the most complex data security method, with the help of available
    technology during the war. This machine was known as **Enigma**.

    typing a message, and used an electromechanical rotary mechanism to encrypt and
    decrypt messages before and after transmission; originally, these were devices
    for banks to perform the secure transfer of financial data, but the Germans started
    using it for all their war-time communications to send encrypted messages to their
    troops in the field. Just to give you a scale, Enigma had about 150 trillion possible
    combinations with a poly-alphabetic substitution cipher, meaning that a single
    alphabet would go through substitution multiple times to finally arrive at a substitution
    alphabet, and the same had to be reversed to get the original alphabet. This technology
    was literally causing the allies a lot of trouble to keep up with the war, and
    they were desperate to break the Enigma code. There were various attempts and
    various research done at the time to break the code. But eventually, it was broken
    by Alan Turing, in 1941, which shortened the war by 2 years. Alan Turing is also
    known as *the Father of Artificial Intelligence*.

    and so did security concerns; at that time, security was only focused on physical
    systems and making sure no unauthorized personnel had access to them. Basically,
    locking down physical devices and systems, and only allowing certain authorized
    persons to access them physically was more important. But this scenario soon changed
    with changes in the technology landscape. Our early computers were single-user
    systems, and later, computers became multi-user systems that could be remotely
    accessed, which made security professionals rethink the approach toward the overall
    security of access to applications and networks by users. This gave birth to the
    concept of authentication—to access files based on the user and their need. This
    concept led to the possibility of a shared system. But this concept had a flaw,
    because it needed to be configured properly to give the right permissions to the
    right person, otherwise information leakage could occur.

    and other, newer client-server models, it was obvious that these systems were
    getting connected over the telephone network. This connectivity requirement was
    one of the main reasons why ARPANET, our early internet, came into existence in
    1973\. Even though, in the beginning, it only connected just a few universities,

    its own perimeter security challenges. Suddenly, it was also evident that there
    was a gap in security architectures and that information could be exposed. Once
    again, military concepts helped, building virtual boundaries with a certain set
    of rules built into systems guarding the boundaries; whom to allow, whom not to
    allow. Basically, the focus was to position a gatekeeper around a corporate network
    boundary and interact via that gatekeeper with other outside organizations. This
    was named a firewall. These devices were simple packet-filtering appliances. The
    earliest firewalls, commonly known as first-generation firewalls, would often
    block or allow traffic by inspecting TCP/IP packets, based on the filtering rules
    defined on the firewalls.

    firewalls made progress and evolved generation by generation. The following generations
    of firewalls brought in features such as application layer filtering; application-level
    firewalls will typically examine the stream of data rather than just the TCP/IP
    packets. These allowed the making of advanced-level decisions to act on packets
    when they were passing through these devices. Because first-generation firewalls
    never inspected application-level data streams, they were vulnerable to certain
    attacks and backdoors. Application firewalls can now be configured to inspect

    recent attacks have been successful in bypassing existing security solutions,
    traditional or advanced. These attacks were successful because they were able
    to hide within the legitimate realm of our network and infrastructure. Our current
    security solutions are designed to detect threats based on scanning for known
    issues, filtering, or dropping bad actors, or even trying to monitor identity
    and user habits, and so on, but these things are not able to deter attacks. The
    primary reason is that these are still focused on reacting to a security event,
    responding to the security findings of security events that have happened, and
    lastly, planning for how to recover from them. In other words, its a **reactive
    security response***.* A reactive response is good, but does not hold ground to
    a level where it can compete with the advanced attacks of today. We need to redirect
    our focus toward a **proactive security response**, and the industry today is
    moving from a reactive to proactive security response already. This is a paradigm
    shift in security frameworks and methodologies on how we predict, analyze, and
    respond to threats. Unlike in a reactive form of security response, proactive
    methodologies provide greater in-depth visibility into the attack infrastructure.
    Simply put, a proactive method is to approach from an attacker's view of the attack
    surface and try to predict attacks in advance and apply proper measures.

- en: As the logic goes, a reactive security response model is the mindset of *"if
    and when there is an attack,* *the systems and security analysts will respond
    to it."* It's about laying a trap with known attack parameters and methods and
    waiting for the monitoring and detection systems to react to it. In a reactive
    form, the attention is always given to form a strong perimeter defense to thwart
    attacks that attempt to penetrate the network. This form of security is very much
    localized to the business unit and its activities, and it does not take advantage
    of attacks of a similar nature, against another business or industry verticals.
    Reactive security does not provide a 360° view of the threat landscape but a reactive
    way of achieving security operations is always simpler, faster to bring up, and
    has lower operational costs. Reactive security monitoring can be further enhanced
    with data feeds from antivirus detection systems, vulnerability scanners, and,
    at times, DLP systems. The flip side of such a model is that it will always react
    to security detection after a breach or compromise has occurred.

    an intelligence-driven model, where the system is enriched with actionable intelligence
    data, from multiple internal and external sources, working in line with existing
    real-time monitoring systems. This proactive method will have visibility of the
    entire threat landscape and all phases of the cyber kill chain, and not just focus
    on one or partial phases of the kill chain. One of the key aspects of proactive
    security is threat hunting, which allows analysts to get more insights into the
    network and systems by trying to uncover any anomalies, or any abnormal changes
    in network behavior, any presence of known bad files in the systems, or maybe
    there are some registry entries that can be found from previously known attacks.
    As an analyst, you can also look for known **indicators of compromise** (**IOCs**)
    in the network. Threat hunting is a continuous process and will always involve
    trying to look for a new set of information as received from threat intelligence
    sources. Threat hunting can also be done automatically by looking into network
    behavior, system anomalies, timeline analysis of certain events, looking into

    be achieved by acquiring specific threat information (intelligence) about various
    systems, processes, networks, applications, perimeter defense mechanisms, and
    other IT assets. This data is then collected, analyzed, and enriched to provide
    proactive and actionable threat intelligence. One of the reasons threat intelligence
    is so important is because current threats are highly sophisticated and difficult
    to detect. We must acquire very specific information and perform a search for
    signs of compromise with actionable content from any threat intel source. To stay

    for the SIEM and incident response systems to analyze and correlate the collected
    threat information with the security alerts and events it is monitoring. These
    threat alerts from the threat intel system will also empower SOC professionals
    to create custom signatures for further detection. Threat intelligence systems
    gather various pieces of information related to incidents, events, logs, security
    vulnerabilities, recent and past known attack data, detection data from the security
    and network devices of the organization, along with information from external
    threat feeds. You can also set up a honey pot system to collect attack information
    and use it as threat data. All data collection needs to be focused and meaningful
    for the organization that intends to use it, because every business is different,
    with distinct needs and types of infrastructure. For threat intelligence to be
    effective, the collection of intelligence data must be done in a centralized manner,
    as systems collect threats and vulnerability information from a wide range of
    locations and devices to correlate data. You must collect data from both internal
    and external sources, as both combined will provide more detailed information
    on threats and attack vectors, specific to your industry or organization. Also,
    focus on collecting information about any ongoing global attack and its attack
    vectors, related mitigation instructions and detection parameters from agencies
    such as government CERT, NIST, ENISA, and so on, along with industry sources,
    Cisco, Symantec, McAfee, Microsoft, RSA, and other major vendors. You may also
    focus on open source threat intel such as OSINT, SANS Internet Storm Center, and
    Open Threat Exchange. All this collected threat information needs to be properly
    categorized and segregated based on threat types, and its importance to the business
    entity and function; it could be, for example, based on the geolocation of the
    business unit, the business applications you are using, and IT infrastructures.
    Geolocation is important from the perspective of identifying where the threat
    actually originated so that you can have more of a focus on those business locations
    of yours as a priority, as they may have been affected; this could also help establish
    whether it is a targeted attack toward your organization, or maybe a country.
    This scenario can help you pinpoint the most effected business function, application,
    or unit, and gives you room for remediation in advance, or at least on time, before
    it's too late. It will also help in defining proper mitigation and a detection
    strategy to focus on the proper utilization of resources since it is always limited,

    and central monitoring platform. Traditionally, we have always used SIEM as a
    platform that receives information from the rest of the network, as we mentioned
    earlier in this chapter, to correlate and identify threats and security incidents.
    In essence, SIEM has always acted like a device that listens but doesn't say a
    word. However, with today's cybersecurity scenarios, it is prudent for SIEM to
    take a much larger part in the whole process, to say things and collaborate in
    taking action. One prominent activity that SIEM can be tasked with is integrating
    with digital forensic platforms to receive more rich and tactical information
    in real time. Digital evidence, by nature, is extremely volatile, and this also
    drives the response time for any security incident. This fragile and crucial nature
    of digital evidence in any cybersecurity incident forces us to approach the problem
    in a fully automated way. This calls for an automated way of collecting digital
    evidence from a suspected device, and we should do it right on time and integrate
    this telemetry with SIEM to trigger the collection of evidence from endpoints,
    just like a security camera starts recording the actions of a criminal with the
    help of a motion sensor. This, in turn, provides us with detailed information
    about what took place and also provides us with more accurate evidence that is
    collected at the right time—*the time when the incident took place, and not later*.
    By capturing the state of a compromised machine right after it provides shell
    access to cyber criminals, providing an initial analysis of the collected evidence,
    and making everything ready for a deep dive investigation, will help us turn the
    tables on the bad guys. Actually, this is only the beginning; we should also develop
    systems/platforms that will automatically analyze collected evidence and enrich
    this with threat intelligence to gain speed and accuracy.

    and time-consuming, it will be a great advantage. Experience around network protocols
    is essential if you plan to pursue a career as a network engineer and you are
    from a different domain; it will be helpful and advantageous to add additional
    knowledge about network protocols and their working principles. Network security
    professionals also need to be aware of the regulatory norms, policies, and controls,
    which will help them maintain IT security compliance and legal aspects. You can

    and penetration testing, known as VA/PT in the industry, is one of the important
    key verticals of the cybersecurity ecosystem. The process of VA/PT assures organizations
    and security researchers that their information systems are up to date and are
    not exposed to any critical security risks. VA/PT also helps you to be proactive
    in finding security threats and risks before attackers do. The VA/PT stream is
    very exciting and is a highly hands-on field. Apart from security consulting firms
    and big corporations, currently, many product development organizations also have
    their own teams for VA/PT as part of their product security teams. VA/PT researchers
    use various scanning tools to scan the network, applications, and/or other IT
    assets, such as servers during these scanning activities and try to find as many
    vulnerabilities as possible that could be exploited by attackers. Scripting knowledge
    can be very useful here, because, as a researcher, you can then develop your own

    commonly known as RE, can reveal a great deal of information about any malicious
    package—when it was created, what code was used to achieve certain goals, what
    systems, processes, or applications it impacts, and which other files or processes
    it calls to stay stealthy or fulfill its motive. Reverse malware engineers use
    a variety of tools to unpack and disassemble malware files. They also need to
    be experienced in how files are packaged and packed and know about encryption,
    compression, and other technologies related to file systems. Engineers will have
    to use tools such as disassemblers, debuggers, and network traffic analyzers,
    file behavior analyzers, log monitoring, sandbox technologies, and other tools.
    As a malware analyst, you will also have to perform tasks on potential samples
    that the organization has detected from its incident response or other security
    processes. You will need to establish the impact the malware may be having on
    the business or the organization. While performing malware analysis, you will

    products, but as the very fabric on which every organization builds its technology.
    DDLS is a training partner with Microsoft, Google Cloud, AWS, and Red Hat; all
    of these vendors build fantastic, secure products, which someone has to design,
    deploy, and manage securely. The point here is that cybersecurity isn't separate
    from business. It is business as usual.

    cloud services to their business.  It is way beyond the scope of this section to
    dive into developing secure code, but clearly no one wants an application that
    is easy to compromise. Of course, that hands on stream includes security appliances
    such as Checkpoint, end point security such as Trend, and network security built
    into Cisco products. Only after we have thought about the proper opportunity to
    manage security can we start to think about the more generic cybersecurity training,
    such as the Ethical hacker programs from EC Council.

    up in curly brackets. For example, an Incident Manager is the one after whom the
    company runs when the company database hits the internet. I see these roles as
    ones not engaging in the technical aspects of implementing cybersecurity. Consider
    them as an analyst role, perhaps tasked with analyzing and assessing vulnerabilities
    in the infrastructure. This investigates tools and countermeasures to remedy the
    detected vulnerabilities, and recommends solutions and best practices. They also
    test for compliance with security policies and procedures. The infrastructure
    in this example includes software, hardware, networks, and people. Therefore,
    it is easy to see that it would be hard to have domain level expertise across
    every discipline.  You would need the support of someone with hands on skills
    in Cisco or AWS. Hopefully it''s clear that providing a prescriptive view of who
    is who in the cybersecurity zoo isn''t possible. Therefore, here is some homework
    for you: use tools such as LinkedIn and job seeking websites of choice and check
    out roles such as Security Analyst, Security Engineer, Security Architect, Security
    Software Developer, Chief Information Security officer, Security Specialist, Penetration
    Tester, Forensic Investigator, Disaster Recovery Analyst, and so on.'

    there are training courses and certifications that are mapped to a product. A
    Checkpoint Security certification is really valuable if you support Checkpoint
    devices; the same rules apply to cloud platforms and networking hardware. You
    can bet on Cisco as it's very dominate, but if your dream job is for an organization
    that has built its networking on top of Huawei hardware, Cisco skills are suddenly
    less relevant . However, they are still usable and concepts tend not to change,
    just the way the technology deals with it does. There are of course other training
    courses and certifications that are not vendor-specific. These courses tend to
    be more portable. The concept of what a denial of service attack is is the same
    irrespective of your choices of IT vendor.

    from some of these vendors will help you get a secure foot on the ladder, help

    quickly. We are in an era where knowledge can be gained much easier than 20 years
    ago; back then, for us to be able to learn, we had to go to libraries, borrow
    books (if we were lucky, as not too many IT books are in libraries), but, today,
    blogs, computer-based training, YouTube, and classroom-based training is much
    easier to reach and much more affordable. So, to keep it short, even if you cannot
    attend conferences, today, most of them are broadcast live, so watch them; follow
    technology leaders on Twitter; subscribe to a couple of valuable email lists;
    and read, learn, and, of course, practice.
