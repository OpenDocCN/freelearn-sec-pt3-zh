- en: The Assembly language is the lowest-level human readable programming language
    on any platform. Knowing the way things are on the Assembly level will help developers
    design their code in a much more elegant and efficient way.

- en: Unfortunately, the modern world of software development does not require deep
    understanding of how programs are executed on the low level, not to mention the
    number of scripting languages and different frameworks that are there to ease
    the process of software development, and which are often mistakenly treated as
    inefficient mostly because developers think that the framework/scripting engine
    should cope with the lameness of the code. The intent behind this book is to show
    how important it is to understand the basics, which are too often left behind
    a developerâ€™s learning curve.

- en: The Assembly language is a powerful tool that developers may use in their projects
    to gain more efficiency with their code, not to mention that Assembly is the basis
    of computing even in today's world of high-level languages, software frameworks,
    and scripting engines. The core idea behind this book is to familiarize software
    developers with things that are often skipped or are not given enough attention
    by developers and, much worse, by those who teach them. It may be hard to believe
    that the Assembly language itself is only the tip of the iceberg (unfortunately,
    the part of the iceberg that is hidden in water falls outside the scope of this
    book), but even it alone may highly improve your ability to develop much cleaner,
    more elegant and, more importantly, much more efficient code.
