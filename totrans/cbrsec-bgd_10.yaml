- en: Cybersecurity is a buzzword right now. While it could be assumed to be a high-level,
    technical, and complex undertaking, in reality, it is just a few precautions that
    everyone in an organization can take to keep safe. It is not the burden of the
    IT department to keep everyone, as well as all devices, networks, and systems,
    safe. Most attacks are not even caused by direct attacks to networks, devices,
    or systems. Humans are the weakest link in the cybersecurity chain, and taking
    a few extra security precautions could shield the company from losses. This chapter
    will provide some of the resources that users in the organization can utilize
    to achieve this. It will be helpful for all types of users, both technical and
    non-technical. It will inform the average non-technical users of the security
    precautions they should take so as not to expose themselves to security threats.
    It will also give technical IT users a reference point to check the security of
    their organization or to learn more about the solutions that they need to implement
    to offer more security to users and digital assets owned by the organization.

    is an online platform that all users can refer to for a comprehensive checklist
    of all the things they need do to be less prone to attacks. It is focused on protecting
    privacy and preventing exposure to malware and phishing attacks. The Security
    Checklist is composed of the following items:'

- en: '**Password managers**: There is a big problem in creating unique passwords
    for all services that you have an account with. Most users reuse the same passwords
    and this exposes them to more threats; once one account is compromised, hackers
    can access your other accounts. Many attacks involving the theft of credentials
    have resulted in such files being sold on black markets. Buyers will try to use
    the credentials to access other accounts linked with the username. This website
    offers several options of password managers that users can download and install
    on Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, and Linux. It also provides reading resources
    about password managers to help users understand their functions.'

    to the loss of data belonging to billions of users with different companies, the
    site informs you that you should assume that your SSN, credit report, and other
    personal details are known by hackers. To prevent hackers from opening new lines
    of credit using this information, the site encourages users (in the US) to enable
    a freeze on credit report checks on all bureaus.'

    they access on the internet is facilitated by DNS, which serves the role of translating
    domain names into IP addresses. However, DNS is highly insecure and it has been
    established that service providers log and sell data that passes through it. You
    can switch to using DNS tools that are security and privacy-focused. Cloudflare
    offers the 1.1.1.1 DNS address that still does domain-name resolution but is faster
    and more secure than the normal DNS provided by service providers. The site offers
    sites you can use to learn more about switching to the secure DNS.'

    attacks. In addition, protocol analyzers, such as Ethereal or Wireshark, can be
    used to capture traffic flowing in a network and identify the sites being visited.
    VPNs solve this problem by offering a secure internet connection that is encrypted
    so that all the data you send or receive cannot be read by people snooping on
    a network. The resource provides six trusted VPN providers: IVPN, Encrypt.me,
    ExpressVPN, NordVPN, ProtonVPN, and Private Internet Access. Most of these are

    scripts that can open your webcam without asking for permission and take pictures
    or videos. It is also possible to turn off the light indicator that shows that
    a computer''s webcam is active. In addition, surfing in public places exposes
    you to shoulder-surfing, where malicious people simply watch and steal sensitive
    data when you enter it into a website or system. The site proposes two solutions:
    webcam covers and laptop privacy screens. Webcam covers make it impossible for
    hackers to see anything when they hijack the webcam and the privacy screen is
    a filter that blocks visibility of a screen outside of 60 degrees.'

    have been requesting excessive permissions to sensitive data that is not required
    for their primary functionalities. Others have been granted permissions that allow
    them to act as espionage tools. The most abused permissions are location, microphone,
    camera, contacts, and messages. Besides apps, there are services that request
    access to social media accounts but access data that is not relevant to the functions
    they offer. For instance, a Twitter follower count service might have gotten access
    to reading messages in your inbox. Part of the security checklist informs users
    that they should revoke excess permissions from apps and services. The checklist
    provides resources that guide Android, iOS, Windows, and macOS users on how to
    manage the permissions they have granted to apps. In addition, the checklist offers
    resources that can be used to opt out of services that read data from social media

    tools and advanced software to breach accounts. They, at times, just request access
    from users under false pretenses. Many phishing attacks are being conducted via
    mail where users are being tricked into sharing sensitive credentials with people
    who claim to be from legitimate companies. In many cases, the targets are given
    malicious links that contain exact clones of login pages to some commonly used
    websites. Once the users enter their details, the hackers proceed to use the details
    on the correct websites and steal money or data.'

    employees physical security keys and one-time access codes. The relevance of the
    post was that Google was going to share this solution with the public by allowing
    Android phones to serve as physical security keys. However, the implementation
    would be limited to only Google-linked services. Another relevant post was the
    admission of a breach by an Italian firm, but two years after the incidence happened.
    The breaching involved the theft of personal data belonging to more than 2,000,000
    customers. Buca di Beppo, the breached company, downplayed the claims for two
    years. Nevertheless, the company later admitted to having been hacked. However,

    The post explained how to detect spy cameras in hotels and how to scan the network
    in hotels to find spy cameras. The names of spy devices will tend to differ from
    those of normal devices. The post said that, using the IP address of the suspicious
    device, you can scan the open ports and find out whether it has **rtsp** (**real-time
    streaming protocol**) or **rtmp** (**real-time messaging protocols**) services
    running. However, readers are cautioned that this alone is not enough or a sure

    that organizations are facing today: phishing. Even after spending lots of money

    of all of its 2,000,000,000 users was attributed to phishing. Many other companies
    have been the victim of phishing attacks, where employees simply surrender login
    credentials, send money, or click malicious links, causing their devices to be
    infected. SlashNext states that phishing can be initiated via emails, free software
    on the web, browser add-ons, online chat forums, social media, messages, and popups
    in browsers. After making the initial contact with the target, the hackers will
    use all the techniques at their disposal just to win the trust and thus hack the
    target. SlashNext offers a 30-minute informative webinar on the new types of phishing,
    why existing solutions are not able to contain the threat, and how organizations
    can use real-time threat intelligence to help stop phishing attempts before they
    become successful against employees.

- en: 'This chapter focused on valuable resources for security intelligence. We looked
    at three broad resources: security checklists, news or advisory sites, and cybersecurity
    training websites. The security checklist discussed was thorough and takes the
    user through the A-Z of security. It is aimed at ensuring that they protect themselves
    and their devices from hacking, espionage, scams, and privacy infringement. The
    checklist has identified some of the security tools that users need to have to
    ensure that they secure their devices. It has also highlighted some of the security
    changes that users should take regarding the exposure of personal information
    on social media. The chapter looked at the trustworthy news sources, which double
    as cybersecurity advisers. The websites reviewed provide well-researched information
    about cybersecurity incidences in the real world and they break down how the incidences
    happened and how they can be prevented. For instance, one website featured the
    privacy issues of hotel rooms having spy cameras. It explained a relatively easy
    way that a tech-savvy person could track the spy cameras through the use of network
    and port scans. Finally, the chapter looked at cybersecurity training resources
    and highlighted four resources. The first one offers training on phishing while
    the others offer a wider variety of courses with certifications. All the discussed
    resources are invaluable to anyone with interest in cybersecurity either as a
    practitioner or for the sake of securing themselves from attacks.'
