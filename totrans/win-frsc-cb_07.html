<p>Some features of Windows operating systems produce a great number of valuable artifacts that can be further used as pieces of digital evidence. The most common sources of such artifacts are the Recycle Bin, Windows Event Logs, LNK files, and Prefetch files.</p>
<p>The Recycle Bin contains files and folders that have been deleted by the user via the right-click menu. In fact, these files are not deleted from the file system, but only moved from their original location into the Recycle Bin. There are two formats of the Recycle Bin: the Recycler format (Windows 2000, XP) - files are stored under <kbd>C:\Recycler\%SID%\</kbd> and their metadata is stored in the <kbd>INFO2</kbd> file; and the <kbd>$Recycle.Bin</kbd> format - files are stored under <kbd>C:\$Recycle.Bin\%SID%\</kbd> in <kbd>$R</kbd> file, and their metadata is stored in $I files.</p>
<p>As you can guess from the name, Windows Event Logs collect information about different system events. Windows 2000, XP, and 2003 (except for server versions) store these logs in three files: Application, System, and Security. These files can be found under <kbd>C:\Windows\system32\config</kbd>. With Windows Vista, the Event Logs format has been changed to XML. These EVTX files can be found under <kbd>C:\Windows\System32\Winevt\Logs</kbd>.</p>
<p>LNK files or Windows Shortcut files refer to other files: applications, documents, and so on. These can be found system-wide, and can help a digital forensic examiner to uncover some of the suspect's activities, including recently used files, applications, and so on.</p>
<p>And, finally, Prefetch files. You can find these files in <kbd>C:\Windows\Prefetch</kbd>, and they contain lots of valuable information about used applications, including their run count, last run date and time, and so on.</p>
<p>In this chapter, you will learn how to analyze all of these sources of digital evidence with both commercial and free digital forensics tools.</p>

<p>EnCase is a well-known and court-accepted commercial digital forensics tool developed by Guidance Software. It is used by examiners from all over the world, both in law enforcement agencies and in the private sector. It supports the whole investigation life cycle, from collecting to reporting. What's more, it has a built-in scripting language - EnScript - so users can write their own scripts to solve digital forensic problems. A lot of useful EnScripts are available for free at <span>EnCase App Central. In this recipe, we will show you how to use this powerful tool to examine Windows Recycle Bin contents.</span></p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>The steps for Recycle bin Content Analysis in Encase Forensic are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Let's start by creating a new case. To do this, click on the <span class="packt_screen">New Case</span> link on the left. The Case <span class="packt_screen">Options</span> window will pop up, as you see in the following figure:</li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="621" width="770" class="image-border" src="assets/59d7a560-88fc-49f3-bf5e-8e512f36aac8.png"/></div>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Figure 7.1. Case Options</div>
<ol start="2">
<li>We have chosen <span class="packt_screen">#2 Forensic</span> template, and there is a lot of information to fill in. Let's start with Case information. Here, we have 6 fields to fill in: <span class="packt_screen">Case Number</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Case Data</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Examiner Name</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Examiner I.D.</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Agency,</span> and <span class="packt_screen">Description</span>. All fields are self-explanatory, so just fill them in.</li>
<li>Let's go to <span class="packt_screen">Name and location</span>. Type your case's name or number in the first field, and choose the <span class="packt_screen">Base case folder</span> (case files will be stored here). The <span class="packt_screen">F</span><span class="packt_screen">ull case path</span> field will be filled in automatically.</li>
<li>Go to <span class="packt_screen">Evidence cache locations</span>. You can use the same folder to store cache (to do this, tick <span class="packt_screen">Use base case folder for primary evidence cache</span>), or choose one or two folders to store it.</li>
<li>Finally, if you want your case to be backed up, tick the <span class="packt_screen">Backup every</span> <span>option and choose its value. Don't forget about choosing the backup folder and the maximum size of the backup. Once everything is filled in, just click</span> <span class="packt_screen">OK</span><span>.</span></li>
<li>Now you see a window with your case information, and you are ready to add a forensic image. To do this, click the <span class="packt_screen">Add Evidence File</span> link on the left.</li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="image-border" src="assets/015a15ce-9ca2-40f9-afec-da17e8035809.png"/></div>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Figure 7.2. Adding evidence</div>
<p style="padding-left: 60px" class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">As you can see in the preceding screenshot, there are 6 evidence source options: you can <span class="packt_screen">Add Local Device</span> (don't forget to use a writeblocker), a remote evidence source, E01 or RAW image, and so on. You already have both, an E01 and a RAW image, so you can use one of them. We are going to use an E01 image. If you too, plan to use an E01 image, click the <span class="packt_screen">Add Evidence File</span> link; if you are using a RAW image, click <span class="packt_screen">Add Raw Image</span>.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>Now you see your evidence file. Click on its name to see the contents. It may take some time for EnCase to parse the data. Once data parsing is finished, go to the <span class="packt_screen">$Recycle bin</span> folder:</li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="image-border" src="assets/c9c98df4-7f5c-466f-a3d2-6c13aefeaf34.png"/></div>
<div class="packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">Figure 7.3. <span><span>$Recycle.Bin folder contents</span></span></div>
<p style="padding-left: 60px" class="mce-root">As you can see in the preceding figure, there is a list of the user's security identifiers (SID). This can help an examiner to determine which user placed files into the recycle bin. There are folders too; let's open one of them. In our case, we open the folder <kbd>S-1-5-21-811620217-3902942730-3453695107-1000</kbd>. Look at the next figure:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><span><img class="image-border" src="assets/4274844c-62a2-4c48-b892-87646c0368d9.png"/><br/></span></div>

<p style="padding-left: 60px" class="mce-root">EnCase has parsed the Recycle Bin contents for you automatically. Also, it has gathered a lot of valuable information: the original file name, its original path, deletion date and time, and so on.</p>

<p class="mce-root">Rifiuti2 is an open source tool which enables a computer forensic examiner to analyze Windows recycle bin content. The tool will show you important information such as the recycled file's deletion date and time, its original path, and so on. Rifiuti2 supports both old (starting from Windows 95) and modern (up to Windows 10) recycle bin formats. What's more, language is no problem: the tool supports all localized versions of Windows.</p>

            <article>
                
<p class="mce-root">You already know that each user has their own folder in the recycle bin. Remember, the screenshot from the previous recipe about EnCase —there were a number of folders. To use Rifiuti2, you should first export one of those folders. There are a lot of tools capable of doing this, and you already know some of them, for example Autopsy, FTK Imager, and Magnet AXIOM.</p>
<p class="mce-root">Once you have exported the folder, you are ready to start the Windows Command Prompt and use the tool. If you are using a 32-bit system, go to the x32 folder; if you have a 64-bit system, go to the x64 folder. In both folders, you will find two Windows executables: <kbd>rifiuti.exe</kbd> and <kbd>rifiuti-vista.exe</kbd>. If you exported your folder from a Windows system up to (and including) XP, use <kbd>rifiuti.exe</kbd>, otherwise (starting from Vista) use <kbd>rifiuti-vista.exe</kbd>. In our case, the folder was exported from a Windows 10 image, so we used <kbd>rifiuti-vista.exe</kbd>.</p>
<pre style="padding-left: 30px">
    rifiuti-vista.exe S-1-5-21-3736901549-408126705-1870357071-1001 &gt;                      <br/>    rec_bin.txt
</pre>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">As you can see, we redirected the output to a <kbd>TXT</kbd> file. Look at its contents in the following figure :</p>
<div class="packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="406" width="633" class="image-border" src="assets/26bb0c4a-b52c-4adf-b5e1-f856653161f3.png"/></div>
<div class="packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">Figure 7.5. Rifiuti2 output</div>
<p class="mce-root">Everything is parsed correctly. We have original paths, names, sizes, and deletion timestamps. Have you noticed the Cyrillic symbols? As we mentioned before, all localized versions of Windows are supported!</p>

<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Figure 7.6. Operating system artifacts list</div>

<li>As you can see, there are quite a lot of different operating system artifacts listed, including the Recycle Bin. In our case, there is only one file there. You can see it in the following figure:</li>

<p>The steps for event log analysis with FullEventLogView are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li><span>The first thing you should do after starting the tool is choose the data source. To do this, go to <span class="packt_screen">File</span> - <span class="packt_screen">Choose Data Source,</span> or just press <em>F7</em>.

<p>You have already used this tool recently to collect the Recycle Bin data from a forensic image. This time, we are interested in Event Logs examination, but you can use the same case as for the Recycle Bin if you processed the whole image with default options.</p>

<p>The steps for Event log analysis using Magnet AXIOM are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the case you used for the Recycle Bin forensic analysis and go to the OPERATING SYSTEM artifacts list again, but now choose <span class="packt_screen">Windows Event Logs</span>, as in the following figure:</li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="403" width="214" class="image-border" src="assets/882aacf4-6a75-4761-8514-21cc9f25a1a0.png"/></div>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Figure 7.11. Operating system artifacts list</div>
<ol start="2">
<li>As you can see in the preceding figure, we have a huge number of event logs. To make your analysis easier, you can sort them. For example, we used the <span class="packt_screen">Created Date/Time</span> column to sort our event logs. You can see partial results in the following figure:</li>
</ol>
<div class="mce-root CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="image-border" src="assets/1ee96c31-f413-4183-abc6-d5618ec495b0.png"/></div>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Figure 7.12. Sorted Event Logs records</div>
<p>Of course, you can use other columns to sort your logs, for example <span class="packt_screen">Event ID</span> or <span class="packt_screen">Event Description Summary</span>—it depends on the specific requirements of your case.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p><span>You already know how to export, sort and search through Windows event logs. Now it's time to learn how to recover deleted or corrupted event log artifacts. Thankfully, there is an open source tool by Willi Ballenthin that is capable of solving this problem: EVTXtract. The tool can recover EVTX fragments not only from RAW images, but also from unallocated space and memory dumps.<br/></span></p>

            <article>
                
<p><span>First of all, since EVTXtract is written in Python, make sure you have this installed on your workstation. If not, go to the official Python website, download and install it. Also, you will need</span> <strong>python-evtx,</strong> which you can find in Willi's GitHub. Python-evtx is an EVTX parser, which is a dependence for EVTXtract. To install it, download and unpack the archive from GitHub, open Windows Command Prompt, choose the directory to which you unpacked the archive, and run the following command:</p>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px">
<strong>setup.py install</strong>
</pre>
<p>That's it; now you have python-evtx installed, and you are ready to install <span>EVTXtract. The process is almost the same:</span> download and unpack the archive from GitHub (but now use the <span>EVTXtract download page</span>), open the Windows Command Prompt, choose the directory to which you unpacked the archive, and run the following command:</p>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px">
<strong>setup.py install</strong>
</pre>
<p>We are done. Now you have <kbd>evtxtract.exe</kbd> in your Python 2 scripts folder - in our case it's <kbd><em>C:\Python27\Scripts</em></kbd> - and you are ready to use it.</p>

<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign CDPAlignLeft">First of all, you must decide what you are going to use as the source. You have three options: a disk image in RAW format, a memory dump, or an unallocated space. You have already created RAW disk images and memory images (dumps) in previous recipes, but what about unallocated space? You have already used <strong>Autopsy</strong>, and even recovered some data from an NTFS partition. But you can also use this tool to extract unallocated space to a separate file. To do this, go to <span class="packt_screen">Data Sources</span>, right-click the partition you want to extract unallocated space from, and choose <span class="packt_screen">Extract Unallocated Space to Single File</span><strong>.</strong></p>

<p class="mce-root CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">Once unallocated space is extracted, you can use this file as the source for EVTXtract. To start the recovery process, use the following command:</p>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px">
<strong>evtxtract.exe image.raw &gt; output.xml</strong>
</pre>
<p>Don't forget to change <kbd>image.raw</kbd> to the file of your choice. Once the process is finished, you can analyze and search through the output file.</p>

<p>In our previous recipes, you have already learnt how to create a new case, add evidence files, and examine Windows recycle bin contents with EnCase Forensic. Now it's time to go even further, and meet the EnCase Evidence Processor, and especially the Windows Artifact Parser. This module enables a digital forensic examiner to parse different Windows forensic artifacts, including LNK files, automatically.</p>

<p>The steps for LNK files analysis with LECmd:</p>
<ol>
<li>As we have already said, LECmd can process both single files and folders. If you want to extract information from a single file, use <strong><span class="packt_screen">-f</span></strong> switch; if your target is a directory, use <span class="packt_screen">-d</span> switch. If you are interested only in LNK files pointing to removable drives, you can use <strong>-r</strong> switch. The other available options can be seen in the following figure:</li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="415" width="531" class="image-border" src="assets/979fb92e-9fb9-47c7-8d1d-9d4d577b887e.png"/></div>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Figure 7.18. LECmd options</div>
<ol start="2">
<li>If you want to run LECmd against a file or folder on a forensic image, first you should mount it. Thankfully, you already know how to do this. In our case, the main partition is mounted under <kbd>N:\</kbd>. Let's use LECmd against the <kbd>Roaming</kbd> folder and save the output formatted in xhtml. To do this, use the following command:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px">
<strong>LECmd.exe -d "N:\Users\NP\AppData\Roaming" -xhtml</strong><br/><strong>"C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\test.html</strong>
</pre>
<ol start="3">
<li>You can see part of the xhtml formatted output in the following figure:</li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="236" width="706" class="image-border" src="assets/f7b5feaa-cbe4-462d-bd03-2690dcdd18b2.png"/></div>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Figure 7.19. A part of LECmd xhtml formatted output</div>
<ol start="4">
<li>As you can see in the preceding figure, LECmd extracts lots of information from LNK files. For example, we have MAC (modified, accessed, created) times both for the LNK file and the target file (in our case, LacyMilletCL.doc), as well as the target file's size, absolute path, and even computer ID and MAC address.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you have been following the recipes in this book, you already know what Magnet AXIOM is, and have even used it for forensic analysis of some Windows artifacts. AXIOM is a really good tool, so we are going to continue to show you how to use it for parsing and analysis of different useful operating system artifacts: this time, prefetch files.</p>

<p>As you have already used AXIOM, there is no need to install it - it's already on your workstation. If, for some reason, it's not, refer to the <span><span class="packt_screen">See Also</span> section</span> to learn how to get a trial version of the tool. Also, you will need an evidence source: a forensic image or a folder with prefetch files (this is located in <kbd>C:\Windows\Prefetch</kbd>). As soon as you have located one of the options, you are ready to go.</p>

<p>The steps for Prefetch file analysis with Magnet AXIOM:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a new case and go to <span class="packt_screen">Load evidence</span>. You have five options here: <span class="packt_screen">CONNECTED DRIVE</span>, <span class="packt_screen">FILES &amp; FOLDERS</span>, <span class="packt_screen">COMPUTER IMAGE</span>, <span class="packt_screen">VOLUME SHADOW COPY,</span> and <span class="packt_screen">MOBILE DEVICES</span>, as you can see in the following figure:</li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="image-border" src="assets/dc9f2bcf-d24e-4adf-b776-8ad2bd8d8ee3.png"/></div>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Figure 7.21. Load evidence options</div>
<ol start="2">
<li>As mentioned before, you can use a forensic image or a previously exported folder with prefetch files. If you prefer the first option, choose <span class="packt_screen">COMPUTER IMAGE;</span> if the second, choose <span class="packt_screen">FILES &amp; FOLDERS</span>. In our case, it's a folder, which has been chosen with the help of the AXIOM folder browser.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li>Now, let's go to the artifact details. As we are interested in prefetches, let's choose only these artifacts from the list. Click the <span class="packt_screen">CUSTOMIZE COMPUTER ARTIFACTS</span> button, then <span class="packt_screen">CLEAR ALL</span>, go to <span class="packt_screen">OPERATING SYSTEM,</span> and tick the <span class="packt_screen">Windows Prefetch Files</span> option. You can see how this works in the figure below:</li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="image-border" src="assets/4af7ad11-8a33-4a5a-ac45-4878a82a32a2.png"/></div>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Figure 7.22. Selecting artifacts to include in case</div>
<ol start="4">
<li>So, now, we are ready to start analyzing the evidence. We have chosen only a folder with prefetch files, so very soon we can view parsing results in AXIOM Examine. Once the processing phase is finished, you are ready to view and analyze the results, as shown in the following figure:</li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="image-border" src="assets/b028c5a9-8362-4b38-9882-f9284bd94ae8.png"/></div>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Figure 7.23. Prefetch files parsing results</div>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">As you can see, we can get the number of runs for each program, and also the timestamps of up to eight recent runs. A very valuable piece of information, especially for malware forensics!</p>

<p>If you have found some suspicious prefetch files and want to perform in-depth analysis, there is another tool by Eric Zimmerman that can help you - PECmd. This is a free and fast command-line tool capable of parsing Windows Prefetch files, both in old and new formats. In this recipe, we will show you how to extract valuable data from prefetches with the help of this tool.</p>

<p>Go to the PECmd download page, get the archive with the tool - at the time of writing, the most recent version is 0.9.0.0 - and unpack it. Also, you will need a prefetch file to work with, or a folder with such a file. As you already know, it can be exported from a forensic image with a tool of your choice. As soon as you get it, open the Windows Command Prompt, and you are ready to go!</p>

            <article>
                
<p>The steps for prefetch file parsing with PECmd are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Using the Windows Command Prompt, change the directory to the one where you unpacked the archive, and run the following command:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px">
<strong>PECmd.exe -f C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\Prefetch\ACRORD32.EXE-</strong><strong>41B0A0C7.pf</strong>
</pre>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">You will see the output very shortly, as in the following figure:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="414" width="567" class="image-border" src="assets/9b734e5b-ef9e-4384-bafc-9ccf323aa9c1.png"/></div>
<div class="packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">Figure 7.24. PECmd output</div>
<ol start="2">
<li>As you can see in the preceding figure, we can get the executable name, its run count, <span>timestamps of the</span> last eight runs, and even lists of directories and files references. Not bad, right?</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">You can also parse all files in a directory recursively. To do this, use the following command:</p>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px">
<strong>PECmd.exe -d C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\Prefetch\</strong>
</pre>
<p>The tool is tiny, but really powerful, and is highly recommended for use in Windows Prefetch analysis in your forensic examinations.</p>
