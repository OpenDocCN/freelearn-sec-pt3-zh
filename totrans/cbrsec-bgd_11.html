<p>To make this book more valuable and help you to excel on your cybersecurity journey, I reached out to some industry experts and asked them how they started their career in cybersecurity and what they would recommend to you to allow you to improve.</p>
<p>I spoke to industry experts from Fortune 500 companies such as Microsoft, Standard Chartered bank, SAP, and FireEye, and experts from Oxford University, Charles Sturt University, army veterans, active cybersecurity consultants, architects, hiring managers, speakers from Black Hat and other tier-1 security conferences, and cybersecurity firm owners, as well as law enforcement professionals. Hopefully, this chapter will help you in your career.</p>

<p>"Our teams must be as diverse as the problems we are trying to solve."</p>
<p>The preceding statement is not an empty platitude, and it is not something that should be trivialized or over-hyped either. We are facing a battle against cybercrime that is impacting all aspects of our lives, including governments, financial systems, food supplies, water supplies, critical infrastructure, and healthcare. Large-scale cyber events, such as those witnessed in the past several years, threaten our very way of life. So, the question becomes, how did we get here? More importantly, where do we go from here? What can you, as a candidate, do to pursue a career in cybersecurity?</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>To explain, let me take you on my personal career journey. I graduated from college with a dual major in political science and communication, and an ambition to attend law school. I was accepted into law school and had obtained a scholarship for tuition and fees, but I was burdened financially from my undergraduate work and was also concerned about food, housing, healthcare, and so on. I made a decision to pursue a career rather than attend law school. Jobs in Northern Utah were scarce in the late 1980s for a graduate who didn't have a directly applicable degree, that is, one in accounting or medicine, and I ultimately moved to the Los Angeles area. I had one short-term position as an executive assistant in a medical firm, and then found my calling in technology.</p>
<p>My calling came by way of a newspaper ad for a floor salesperson at a wage of $17,000 USD per annum. I knew a bit about computers—as in, I could use one—and I knew I could talk to people, so a career was born. I attended every vendor training available and was diligent in studying and developing my skills. I was fortunate to have two early career mentors who encouraged my success and taught me everything they knew. I took on assignments related to operations, sales, network architecture and installation, computer repair, storage, partner engagement, customer engagement, and so on. I learned and absorbed all I could. At the time, mainframes and mini-computers dominated the industry, and PCs and client-servers were becoming a thing. Storage systems were massive near-line devices, and the biggest concern for a CIO was a rogue phone line in a data center. There were very few formal CISO positions, and security folks were generally of two types: investigators and network professionals. I entered security somewhat accidentally, but according to a plan.</p>
<p>In 1999, I was based in Chicago and working as a healthcare specialist for Data General. Data General was acquired by the EMC Corporation. I explored my options post acquisition and decided to make a change. The change was inspired by the hardware token I carried for authentication. I was fascinated by the technology, and I pursued a company called RSA Security and was ultimately hired as a PKI specialist. I not only had to look up the term, I had to study and develop an understanding of PKI, which I did. So, in 2000, a new career began—I was still in tech but in a highly specialized, but very nascent, field called cybersecurity (InfoSec at the time). CISOs were a thing by then—in very large organizations—and 2FA was used by about 20% of corporate employees (yes, that was all).</p>
<p>Since 2000, I have once again committed myself to self-study, learning, and growth—developing a deep understanding of the underlying technology of cybersecurity and the methods, modes, and motives of threat actors. I have also come to an understanding that there are simply too few people in cybersecurity roles. We used to joke, circa 2000, that people spent more on their annual coffee budgets than on their IT security budgets. If they had a firewall, a router, and an antivirus solution, and high-value users were using 2FA, everything was covered as far as most organizations were concerned. They were not prepared or adequately budgeted for the hyper growth in anytime, anywhere connected devices; the explosion of mobile devices that are as powerful as legacy servers; cloud-based technologies; the explosion of nation-state funded threat actors; or the explosion of malware and cybercrime as an industry. Universities and colleges were delayed in offering a cybersecurity-based curriculum, relying on a lot of network-based courses to cover the topic. Cybersecurity professionals were largely still from network or investigative backgrounds, and the industry was collapsing under the weight of too many disparate tools and too-many-point solutions.</p>
<p>By any measure, there are currently about 1 million open cybersecurity roles globally that all say something akin to <em>"must have 10 years' experience, STEM degree...."</em> We are becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy as an industry. We claim we want diverse backgrounds and skills, and we have too many job openings; we want to reduce complexity, but we continue to hire the same profiles, bemoan the lack of talent, and choose a single-point solution to add to our growing list of solutions because it solves a specific problem.</p>
<p>This group thinking, as an industry, has limited our options for hiring a diverse set of talent and for deploying the required solutions and technology to solve problems. For example, research shows us that diverse teams make better and faster decisions 78% of the time. Yet, we ignore this in the interest of quickly filling roles and a fundamental lack of desire to train the next generation of cybersecurity professionals due to our immediate need to protect our infrastructure.</p>
<p>As a self-taught infrastructure professional, who also taught myself cybersecurity via vendor and industry training immersion, I am a strong advocate for bringing in new voices from a wide range of backgrounds and different perspectives to drive meaningful change in the industry and to stay one step ahead of the bad actors. In addition, our tooling must modernize. We must fully realize the capabilities of tools such as machine learning to get a handle on the trillions of threats we see daily. We must also operate in partnership with public organizations, private companies, peers, and competitors. We must act like a community; an industry. We must also account for the stress of being a defender who is often working extraordinarily long hours in an understaffed environment.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>So, where does this all leave us? It leaves us with an industry that has some opportunities to improve. We have the tools, we have the technology, we have available pools of talent, but we must have the will. We must have the will to take risks; we must have the will to accept that change is needed. We must have the will to hire a wide variety of people from diverse educational and societal backgrounds. We must create a community that takes care of its members and empowers people to be their absolute best. We don't actually have a choice; cybercrime is here to stay. What is needed now is a cybersecurity industry that acts as a community to bring the best tools, people, and partnering together as a robust solution. We can do this through investment in education programs at the grade school-level through to the high-school level, by investing in organizations that fund scholarships and mentorship programs for diverse individuals, through programs that invest in training transitioning military members and retraining displaced workers. We can actually bring cybersecurity to the broader population by simplifying the lexicon of the industry and making it less intimidating. We can mentor broadly, and we can speak publicly and frequently on the need for change and the steps required.</p>
<p>Given the need to evolve as an industry, what can you do as a candidate? I described my history here as a way to encourage you to be creative and to self-learn throughout your whole career. As a candidate, you need to work to describe your skills in a way that translates them to the cybersecurity landscape. Are you an experienced teacher? We need learning materials to explain complex concepts in simpler terms. Are you a psychology major? We need to understand the motives of attackers. Are you in law enforcement? We need to complete investigations. Are you a business analyst? We need to comprehend vast amounts of data. And if you are a programmer, network engineer, or database architect, there is a natural place for you in security—leverage your existing skills and learn new ones. Take risks and be part of the change that cybersecurity needs to fulfill its mission of securing global enterprises and governments. Seek out mentors and learn from them. Act now to join a quickly growing and highly exciting industry.</p>

<p><strong>What is the place of the general public in the new tech revolution?</strong></p>
<p>Rapid technological progress in <strong>artificial intelligence</strong> (<strong>AI</strong>) is about to transform existing business models. Companies are beginning to use AI to help manage their human resources, attract and promote the loyalty of clients and customers, and increase transparency in their supply chains. Companies are also using AI to automate decision-making processes about their employees, customers, and suppliers.</p>
<p>This process began with companies using big data analytics to increase transparency in supply chains and continued with companies using cloud-based systems and AI to process the enormous amount of data collected globally from thousands of workplaces. Efforts to develop AI and blockchain (<a href="https://blog.sweetbridge.com/managing-supply-chains-on-the-blockchain-a-primer-1f7dc293e3d9?gi=8bee415e5b5a">https://blog.sweetbridge.com/managing-supply-chains-on-the-blockchain-a-primer-1f7dc293e3d9?gi=8bee415e5b5a</a>) to improve supply chain traceability are still pretty new, and the focus so far has mainly been limited simply to ensuring that products can be traced from lower tiers of the supply chain to supermarket shelves. There are even fewer initiatives that focus on sustainability (<a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/deepmind-ai-reduces-google-data-centre-cooling-bill-40/">https://deepmind.com/blog/deepmind-ai-reduces-google-data-centre-cooling-bill-40/</a>), and these have largely been directed toward environmental sustainability (<a href="https://www.eli.org/vibrant-environment-blog/environmentalism-next-machine-age">https://www.eli.org/vibrant-environment-blog/environmentalism-next-machine-age</a>); so far, little attention has been paid to the potential of AI to address labor and human rights issues. However, it is clear that AI will have a real impact in these areas and that it will directly affect the existing relationships between corporations, their suppliers, workers, and customers.</p>
<p>Thus, AI can analyze a vast amount of data very quickly and offer a summary judgment that can be used to inform decision-making (<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13347-017-0263-5">https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13347-017-0263-5</a>). However, a primary concern in this context is the extent to which AI analysis can be relied upon to produce objective judgments (<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13347-017-0285-z">https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13347-017-0285-z</a>) that do not simply reproduce and legitimize existing discrimination or inequalities (<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2017/08/01/algorithms-future-must-not-allow-become-shield-injustice/">https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2017/08/01/algorithms-future-must-not-allow-become-shield-injustice/</a>). This concern has prompted discussions about the accountability and transparency of algorithms. And there have been efforts to understand how to mitigate the potentially discriminatory and unfair decisions of algorithms in a range of important areas of life, such as, say, applying for a bank loan or seeking justice.</p>
<p><strong>Revolution for corporations?</strong></p>
<p>Corporations are increasingly benefiting from digital expertise to manage their global production by tracking every move within the supply chain in real time. A companies' application of AI to their operations provides better visibility and predictability; however, these efforts don't yet incorporate human rights into their design at the moment.</p>
<p>As technology companies involved in the development of AI target global corporations as their clients, they don't necessarily focus on the interests and expectations of workers or local businesses. The use of AI to monitor production could massively increase the power of corporations vis-à-vis their suppliers and workers, resulting in the potential surveillance of workers by their employers. UNI Global Union's Future World of Work initiative offers 10 principles for ethical AI (<a href="http://www.thefutureworldofwork.org/docs/10-principles-for-ethical-artificial-intelligence/">http://www.thefutureworldofwork.org/docs/10-principles-for-ethical-artificial-intelligence/</a>) and informs AI designers and companies of the importance of worker inclusion with the aim of safeguarding workers' interests and maintaining a healthy balance of power in workplaces.</p>
<p>In addition, if algorithms (focusing on visibility and traceability, based on real-time information, being received from thousands of workplaces operating in various countries) begin to manage suppliers in an increasingly competitive market, the constant comparison of different countries and workplaces to increase profits will likely increase the pressure on prices, delivery times, and productivity. This would create enormous stress and vulnerability for those suppliers. Local businesses (suppliers) would then transfer all that pressure onto their workers, who would be the real losers of the process.</p>
<p>The current mainstream business model, where companies seek to lower prices at any cost to be competitive, has caused <em>"a race to the bottom"</em> for their suppliers, who are generally located in the Global South, by increasing the productivity of the labor force and decreasing wages. This model (<a href="https://www.ethicaltrade.org/blog/modern-slavery-and-child-labour-its-all-about-choice">https://www.ethicaltrade.org/blog/modern-slavery-and-child-labour-its-all-about-choice</a>) has intensified the exploitation of children through child labor, enabled instances of modern slavery, and undermined health and safety conditions.</p>
<p>As a result, unions and NGOs have taken many steps to support sustainable and fair business and increase respect for human rights in supply chains. Human rights due diligence, promoted by the UN's <em>Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights</em> (<a href="https://www.unglobalcompact.org/library/2">https://www.unglobalcompact.org/library/2</a>), is one expectation of companies as part of their responsibility to respect human rights. This approach allows all stakeholders to collaborate in order to determine the actual and potential risks that harm employees within a workplace or an industry. Instead of a one-sided decision-making process, this approach is action-oriented and calls on all parties to negotiate to address potential and actual risks and to resolve and mitigate the harm caused by them.</p>
<p>These models offer important lessons for companies utilizing AI to manage their relationships with suppliers and employees. If technology companies developing algorithms and training machines ignore all the accumulated experience in this field, they risk destroying existing relationships between global corporations, suppliers, and workers, and erasing human rights by offering unimaginable power to corporations.</p>
<p>The expected results of technological progress depend on users' approaches, and the use of AI to manage supply chains could have a positive impact. It is important that companies and civil society consider two questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>How can we teach machines about human rights and labor rights? (<a href="http://www.siia.net/Press/SIIA-Releases-Ethical-Principles-for-Artificial-Intelligence-and-Data-Analytics-with-Support-from-the-Future-of-Privacy-Forum-and-the-Information-Accountability-Foundation">http://www.siia.net/Press/SIIA-Releases-Ethical-Principles-for-Artificial-Intelligence-and-Data-Analytics-with-Support-from-the-Future-of-Privacy-Forum-and-the-Information-Accountability-Foundation.</a>)</li>
<li>How can suppliers and workers/trade unions influence the machine learning process? (<a href="http://www.thefutureworldofwork.org/docs/10-principles-for-ethical-artificial-intelligence/">http://www.thefutureworldofwork.org/docs/10-principles-for-ethical-artificial-intelligence/</a>.<a href="http://www.thefutureworldofwork.org/docs/10-principles-for-ethical-artificial-intelligence/">)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The answers to these two questions will determine the content of ethics by design. If AI internalizes accumulated knowledge about business and human rights and allows workers and local businesses to track its decision-making process, then it could promote labor rights (<a href="https://www.bsr.org/our-insights/blog-view/remedy-against-the-machine-tech-and-human-rights">https://www.bsr.org/our-insights/blog-view/remedy-against-the-machine-tech-and-human-rights</a>).</p>
<p>For instance, one of the demands of the UNI Global Union is that workers must have the right to access, influence, edit, and delete data that is collected on them via their work processes. Also, global trade unions and corporations should include the role of AI into their areas of collaboration. Additionally, multi-stakeholder initiatives that are alliances of global corporations, trade unions, and NGOs should pioneer this process to act as watchdogs for AI practices (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jan/27/ai-artificial-intelligence-watchdog-needed-to-prevent-discriminatory-automated-decisions">https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jan/27/ai-artificial-intelligence-watchdog-needed-to-prevent-discriminatory-automated-decisions</a>).</p>
<p>A recent report by the House of Lords called <em>AI in the UK: ready, willing and able?</em> (<a href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201719/ldselect/ldai/100/100.pdf">https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201719/ldselect/ldai/100/100.pdf</a>, <em>Chapter 2</em>, page 58) states the following:</p>
<p>"It is important that members of the public are aware of how and when artificial intelligence is being used to make decisions about them, and what implications this will have for them personally."</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p><strong>What about governments?</strong></p>
<p>Over the last 2 years, many countries have released their official strategies on AI (<a href="https://policyatmanchester.shorthandstories.com/on_ai_and_robotics/index.html">https://policyatmanchester.shorthandstories.com/on_ai_and_robotics/index.html</a>). This trend started with the US in 2016, followed by the United Kingdom (UK), Germany, France, the EU, Russia, Japan, China, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).</p>
<p>These official strategies have many issues in common (<a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/652097/Growing_the_artificial_intelligence_industry_in_the_UK.pdf">https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/652097/Growing_the_artificial_intelligence_industry_in_the_UK.pdf</a>). However, they also focus on specific aspects of the technological revolution based on their comparative advantages (<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/growth/tools-databases/dem/monitor/sites/default/files/6%252520Overview%252520of%252520current%252520action%252520Grow.pdf">https://ec.europa.eu/growth/tools-databases/dem/monitor/sites/default/files/6%252520Overview%252520of%252520current%252520action%252520Grow.pdf</a>). For instance, the US places more importance on data-driven innovation; the UK concentrates on the financial sector and health services; Germany focuses on manufacturing, including smart factories and autonomous cars (also known as <strong>Industry 4.0</strong>); Japan aims to improve robotics; and UAE deals with AI in the public sector. Russia and China pay more attention to domestic surveillance and strengthening their military capacities.</p>
<p>One shared concern of these official documents is the fear of <em>missing the boat</em> as technological progress brings rapid changes in society that are likely to directly affect the global balance of power, military strength, economic wealth, and social structures (<a href="https://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/POST-PB-0027">https://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/POST-PB-0027</a>).</p>
<p>For example, in the review of the UK's official strategy (<a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/652097/Growing_the_artificial_intelligence_industry_in_the_UK.pdf">https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/652097/Growing_the_artificial_intelligence_industry_in_the_UK.pdf</a>), Wendy Hall and Jérôme Pesenti define this concern in terms of not being dominated by other countries. The solution also suggests a desire to dominate other countries, by taking advantage of leadership in the new technological revolution, and such an approach does not include any regulations or references to human and labor rights.</p>
<p>Thus, all these global powers focus on the areas in which they have a comparative advantage so as not to lose their superiority, or permit others to overtake them in these areas—with little regard to the human rights risks of these actions.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>The common features (<a href="https://royalsociety.org/~/media/policy/projects/data-governance/data-management-governance.pdf">https://royalsociety.org/~/media/policy/projects/data-governance/data-management-governance.pdf</a>) of these strategies suggest close cooperation between state, industry, and academia. For instance, states have all pledged to allocate billions of dollars in future investments and research projects on AI, and have offered substantial incentives both for global corporations and start-ups to invest in their countries. They are also encouraging universities to open new departments and research centers dealing with different aspects of the technological revolution and create new PhD and post-doc positions to attract the world's best brains.</p>
<p>In addition, authorities have promised to take the necessary measures to adapt the workforce to changing conditions, upgrade skills, and develop a curriculum for students to prepare themselves for dramatic changes in the labor market. Multi-stakeholder AI commissions (<a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/702810/180425_BEIS_AI_Sector_Deal__4_.pdf">https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/702810/180425_BEIS_AI_Sector_Deal__4_.pdf</a>) are formed to audit and monitor the process and deal with the expectations of stakeholders on a day-to-day basis. Since data is crucial for the development and training of algorithms, national data centers/trusts (<a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/702810/180425_BEIS_AI_Sector_Deal__4_.pdf">https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/702810/180425_BEIS_AI_Sector_Deal__4_.pdf</a>) are in the process of forming in order to verify and share data with stakeholders and prevent competitor states from accessing and manipulating the process.</p>
<p>The weakest side of these strategy documents is an inability to suggest any clear approach to the different sections of society, primarily workers and small and medium-sized enterprises. These strategies contain short sections regarding ethical concerns, but they are generally abstract, repeating similar concepts such as accountability, transparency, and complying with ethical rules. But official strategies should go beyond these wishes.</p>
<p>A clear approach to working with different stakeholders is crucial because governments are allocating millions of dollars to promoting AI systems and the planned actions listed will be conducted through close cooperation between corporations, universities, and states without any clear, legally binding ethical and social principles. For instance, what are the social and ethical preconditions and review processes for corporations to receive this government funding for developing AI systems? Without clearly mentioning legal requirements for accessing funding and for auditing processes, terms such as <em>being people-centered</em> and <em>worker-friendly technological progress</em> will remain wishful thinking.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>In addition, while the strategies touch on the potential for AI systems to promote economic growth and wealth, there is no mention of fair income distribution. Some of these documents stress (<a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/702810/180425_BEIS_AI_Sector_Deal__4_.pdf">https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/702810/180425_BEIS_AI_Sector_Deal__4_.pdf</a>) that SMEs will have access to good quality data and benefit from the services and research findings of universities to promote their businesses, and that necessary measures will be taken to avoid unemployment (<a href="https://www.ijhrdppr.com/book-review-martin-ford-rise-robots-technology-threat-mass-unemployment/">https://www.ijhrdppr.com/book-review-martin-ford-rise-robots-technology-threat-mass-unemployment/</a>) through career support and skills training for people who are employed in jobs that are at risk (<a href="http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Future_of_Jobs.pdf">http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Future_of_Jobs.pdf</a>). Finding jobs to avoid unemployment is important, but there is no mention of labor rights or decent working conditions. What kind of employment (<a href="https://theconversation.com/automation-robots-and-the-end-of-work-myth-89619">https://theconversation.com/automation-robots-and-the-end-of-work-myth-89619</a>) will be promoted (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.07228.pdf">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.07228.pdf</a>): short-term, self-employed, precarious working conditions, or decent working conditions with a living wage, freedom of association, and the right to bargain collectively?</p>
<p>So, the common approach of these strategy documents and guidelines on employees and SMEs could be defined as <em>wait and see</em>. It is clear that the consequences of the technological revolution (<a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/brookings-now/2018/05/23/artificial-intelligence-will-disrupt-the-future-of-work-are-we-ready/">https://www.brookings.edu/blog/brookings-now/2018/05/23/artificial-intelligence-will-disrupt-the-future-of-work-are-we-ready/</a>) cannot be fully determined or even imagined yet, so this might mean we are stuck with general concepts and wishes. On the other hand, policy-makers could set out a clearer, more detailed approach. There is already extensive literature on the gig economy, the ethics of AI (<a href="https://www.openglobalrights.org/as-artificial-intelligence-progresses-what-does-real-responsibility-look-like/">https://www.openglobalrights.org/as-artificial-intelligence-progresses-what-does-real-responsibility-look-like/</a>), and debates on protecting people from discriminatory decisions made by algorithms in human resources (<a href="https://www.openglobalrights.org/artificial-intelligence-can-be-a-boon-for-businesses-but-can-it-protect-workers/">https://www.openglobalrights.org/artificial-intelligence-can-be-a-boon-for-businesses-but-can-it-protect-workers/</a>), supply chain management, the judiciary, and the police. This is not only a debate about the future of work and society; it is a process that we are already living through and experiencing, making it imperative that new and ongoing debates, concerns, and demands be considered.</p>
<p>These government strategies set out the expectations and interests of large corporations (<a href="https://theconversation.com/automation-robots-and-the-end-of-work-myth-89619">https://theconversation.com/automation-robots-and-the-end-of-work-myth-89619</a>) and reflect a states' political, economic, and military strategies. However, AI strategies should not only reflect existing competitions, rivalries, and the future strategies of corporations and states. Members of society more broadly should have a say in what kind of future they would like to live in and how they would like to benefit from the technological revolution.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>Therefore, at the dawn of a new technological revolution that is set to transform global supply chain management, it's high time we launch a debate about the role of AI in industrial relations. This is not just in order to stay true to the creed, that is, ethics by design (<a href="https://www.bsr.org/our-insights/blog-view/human-rights-by-design">https://www.bsr.org/our-insights/blog-view/human-rights-by-design</a>), but also as a requirement of innovation. Debate will help us evaluate and develop existing approaches, such as human rights due diligence, as promoted by the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, so we can continue to make progress in this area. In this way, all social partners—including employers, workers, and other related entities, such as NGOs or state authorities—will have greater scope to collaborate in order to assess current and potential risks to employees within the workplace and take steps to mitigate them.</p>

<p>Chief Architect, Cybersecurity, Microsoft</p>
<p><strong>What was your career in before making the switch to cybersecurity?</strong><br/></p>
<p>My career has always involved some form of security and I have evolved as the industry has evolved. My career in IT security has spanned 34 years and has followed a natural interest and passion in the area.</p>
<p><strong>Tell us about your journey transitioning from your primary career to cybersecurity as a career.</strong><br/></p>
<p>I have been very fortunate to have a career where my passion lies. I began with physical security electronic warfare in the <strong>South African Air Force</strong> (<strong>SAAF</strong>) and then embraced many roles in commercial IT. My natural interest and curiosity in computers and how they work has always incorporated security and challenged me to stay one step ahead of attackers.</p>
<p><strong>Why did you choose a career in cybersecurity?</strong><br/></p>
<p>As an industry (and, more specifically, Microsoft), we saw an increase in cyber attacks together with a change in trends. Personally, I was interested in honing a specialized skill set and saw cybersecurity as both a business opportunity and an area for personal investment and growth.</p>
<p><strong>What did you do differently than your peers when choosing cybersecurity as your career?</strong><br/></p>
<p>How I differed from my peers was my interest in security. I was continuously reading about it and completed my ISC ISSP certifications to broaden my knowledge. As an enterprise security architect, I integrated that learning into my job.</p>
<p><strong>Can you please share your views and thoughts for those who want to be part of the cybersecurity industry?</strong><br/></p>
<p>The cybersecurity industry is seeing an increased demand for both generalized and specialized skills. It is not a vendor/product-specific skill that is sought after but rather a broader understanding and knowledge set. The landscape is continuously changing and evolving so it attracts individuals who can problem-solve and apply their learning to new challenges.</p>
<p><strong>In your opinion, how is your old career helping you or influencing you on your cybersecurity journey?</strong></p>
<p>I have evolved as the industry has evolved—I have always been in security and cybersecurity.</p>
<p><strong>What would you like to suggest to our readers who want to start a career in cybersecurity, and how can they can do so?</strong><br/></p>
<p>My suggestion is to build a solid base that allows you to expand in this diverse environment. Firstly, explore—read security blogs, follow industry experts, follow vendor-specific websites, and then determine where you want to focus. It is also essential to do something that interests you and drives your passion.</p>
<p><strong>Do you suggest that someone should be an expert in one vertical of cybersecurity or should they be an expert in every domain of cybersecurity? What is your opinion from an industry perspective?</strong><br/></p>
<p>Everyone should have a common body of knowledge. I always recommend the ISC ISSP certification. Choose a vertical but adopt the T approach, where the top of the T gets wider as you progress in your career and you gain depth in your vertical/specialty (the bottom of the T).</p>
<p><strong>The cybersecurity landscape is ever-changing and extremely dynamic, how do you keep yourself updated? What are your suggestions for our readers?</strong><br/></p>
<p>I do several things to keep myself current. Daily, I review different blogs, Twitter feeds, and user groups. I also subscribe to RSS feeds and attend conferences and webinars. Here are a few key links:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.darkreading.com/Default.asp">https://www.darkreading.com/Default.asp</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/operations/security-intelligence-report">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/operations/security-intelligence-report</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>In your view, what is more important, having a security certification, getting the relevant security training, or gaining hands-on experience through a job?</strong><br/></p>
<p>A combination of all three. There needs to be a balance. Certification gives you credibility, but you definitely need experience that's been gained on the job and through training. You should master your domain by training on tools and continue to develop your skill set. Another crucial area is the sharing of cyber intelligence and threats.</p>
<p><strong>We all agree to the fact that cybersecurity is a non-negotiable factor of today's industry. As an industry leader, in your opinion, what are those new frontiers where cybersecurity will be needed in the near future?</strong><br/></p>
<p>Looking forward, there are two key parts. Today, we see that many organizations haven't got the fundamentals right, so it makes them soft targets for cyber attacks. Secondly, they need to focus on security hygiene—modernizing IT infrastructure, privileged access management and privileged identities, patch management, and reducing the surface attack area. As we go into the future, we are going to see an increase in multi-channel attacks that are going to be more difficult to defend against. We are going to see an increase in the adoption of AI and cloud-security providers and a move away from bolt-on security to built-in security. Traditional security controls will be challenged to deal with the evolution of cloud-based security and zero-trust security.</p>

<p>Founder and Chief Technologist of Keepnet Labs/Content Developer<strong><br/></strong></p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p><strong>What was your career in before making a switch to cybersecurity? Tell us about your journey transitioning from your primary career to cybersecurity.<br/></strong></p>
<p>Since high school, we were told to build up cybersecurity as a career, but we had no idea where to start as students. We read many texts and consulted some acquaintances to gather information regarding a career in cybersecurity and got some standard pieces of advice from the school counselor. However, during those years, developing a career in cybersecurity was complicated, because there were not many credible sources to get advice from. The lack of clarity, guidance, and real interest in cybersecurity continued to persist. So, we did not start our career as cybersecurity specialists. Ozan was occupied with studying math and getting an academic degree, and Orhan was on his way to being a professor of social sciences. However, we realized that we had an interest in cybersecurity and were exhibiting potential skills. Thus, we made a shift on our path to develop a cybersecurity career in which we managed to explore, learn, achieve formal qualifications and certifications, get university degrees, and eventually accomplish a position in cybersecurity.</p>
<p>The primary reason for us choosing cybersecurity as a career was due to a lack of experts in cybersecurity in businesses, as well as because it was a growing area. Cybersecurity is critical to the framework of any modern business. Today, every organization needs professionals in cybersecurity. Since there are many components and roles within cybersecurity, we especially focused on email security, because we realized that most breaches start with a single email.</p>
<p>Before Keepnet came into this process, we went through some other processes. In particular, Ozan, the founder and the CEO of Keepnet, took advantage of the experience by getting lots of practice and a background in shaping the Keepnet project. Before Keepnet was founded, Ozan developed a new-generation security wall with the first company he was cofounder of, Coslat Security systems. This company was focused on the detection and prevention of network-based attacks. After 2 years of gaining expertise at Coslat, Ozan transferred his shares to perform a new venture, leaving Coslat active in business with over 2,000 customers. Ozan continued his career at the BGA Information Security Academy as a manager, where he ran over 39 unique projects on cybersecurity, mainly on penetration testing, forensics, and incident response. With his experience and success in the cybersecurity business and markets, which gave him the opportunity to strictly follow the trends and easily apply appropriate solutions for cybersecurity, Ozan was able to see the risks ahead in information security. He started the Keepnet Labs project, which offers solutions to prevent email-based cyber attacks.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>Then, with the assistance of the Keepnet team, we cooperated and developed a suite of solutions that prevented email-based cyber attacks such as phishing, fraud, malicious content, and attachments, and it continues to preserve safety.<strong><br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>Why did you choose a career in cybersecurity?<br/></strong></p>
<p>We chose a career in cybersecurity because the cybersecurity market was a flourishing industry with swiftly growing business opportunities, because the technology was improving and cybersecurity threats resulted in a demand for qualified manpower. It was clear to us that the world would face a shortfall of cybersecurity experts, not to mention that the salaries were also on the rise.</p>
<p>Even today, companies need skilled cybersecurity employees. According to research by ICS, 47% of people said that they were struggling to find qualified personnel in cybersecurity. Companies have said the shortfall of cybersecurity professionals is having a significant impact on their customers and 45% said it's causing more cybersecurity breaches.</p>
<p>Companies using digital technology put themselves at risk of cyber attacks. To lessen the risk and vulnerabilities, many organizations look for cybersecurity experts to protect their organization against complicated cyber attacks. Also, the shortage of more cybersecurity specialists becomes obvious when you look at the news. Every day, there is a new data breach and a hacking case appears, and most organizations understand that they need to do more to guard themselves against cyber attacks.</p>
<p>Moreover, the high salaries and bonuses of cybersecurity jobs were attractive to us; however, it was the love of the technology that attracted us to this field: the field was exciting, entertaining, interesting, challenging, relevant, and meaningful for us.</p>
<p>Furthermore, with its expanding scope and range, cybersecurity bestowed growth potential for our career and learning opportunities. We knew that we would learn new things over and over. We would work with brand-new technologies that were exciting. Those were the things that encouraged us to start a career in cybersecurity.</p>
<p>With the development of technology and its components, you begin to see various models of issues that cybersecurity experts can control. So, we wanted to challenge these problems and address these issues by identifying, recognizing, and understanding them. No kind of job provides this experience like utilizing the latest in technology, facing quick changes, seeing the creativity in many aspects, and participating in the never-ending struggle between good and bad. This was another reason we chose our career in cybersecurity.</p>
<p>We knew that we could help make the world a better place to live in. Because everything cybersecurity specialists do is intended to bring goodness to the world, to protect people from bad guys who would hurt them.</p>
<p><strong>What you did differently than your peers when choosing cybersecurity as your career?<br/></strong></p>
<p>Cybersecurity is securing the <strong>integrity, confidentiality,</strong> and <strong>availability</strong> (<strong>ICA</strong>) of information. It is the capacity to protect against and recover from accidents and from attacks by criminals. Protecting information is vital for any business. We wanted a career in a field that will always be a top priority for businesses.</p>
<p>Moreover, as technology continues to evolve, so does cybersecurity. Therefore, unlike most of our peers, who built their careers on more traditional jobs, we chose cybersecurity as our career because technology never stops evolving; it dynamically changes.<strong><br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>Share your views and thoughts for those who want to be part of the cybersecurity industry.</strong></p>
<p>Cybersecurity centers on protecting computers, networks, and data from illegal or unauthorized access. It has become more significant because every establishment today, such as governments, corporations, and even people, store or process data using cyberspace. However, data breaches occur almost every week. Organizations are now becoming more aware of the potential threat and they allocate greater resources for services that help mitigate such risks.</p>
<p>Due to the risks mentioned here, the cybersecurity market is one of the fastest growing markets in the business sector and has the potential for huge economic opportunities because steps need to be taken to prevent the escalating number of cybercrimes that organizations encounter every day.</p>
<p>It is obvious that the world is becoming ever more connected. Billions of smart machines and tools are producing huge volumes of data, which provides a critical opportunity for organizations to optimize their operations in a digital environment that both creates important opportunities and also important barricades; that is to say, getting digitized also brings potential risks for organizations. Mainly due to the evolution of <strong>Internet of Things</strong> (<strong>IoT</strong>) devices and new business models that largely depend upon digitization, as well as more complex systems and the interconnectivity of devices and information, the susceptibility to cyber attacks has become much broader, while there are gaps in the security systems of organizations.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>As cyber threats have grown, spending on cybersecurity awareness training and defense platforms has increased. Currently, the security awareness training market exceeds 1 billion USD in annual revenue (globally) and is growing by approximately 13 percent per year. Vendors in the Gartner report account for around 650 million USD in annual revenue. By 2027, the market size is predicted to be 10 billion USD per year. Moreover, the major drivers of this market include stringent government regulation on data privacy and increasing cyber threats. Regulations and standards such as GDPR, PCI DSS, ISO/IEC 27001 and 27002, the <strong>Federal Information Security Management Act</strong> (<strong>FISMA</strong>), the Gramm-Leach Bliley Act, the <strong>Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act</strong> (<strong>HIPAA</strong>), the Red Flags Rule, NERC CIP, CobiT, US state privacy laws, the Australian Government InfoSec Manual, PAS555 Cybersecurity Risk: Governance and Management, and Turkish Government Law #6698 on the Protection of Personal Data all require security awareness programs. This situation also gives a market opportunity for cybersecurity start-ups, as the <em>Cybersecurity Market</em> report illustrated that the cybersecurity market is expected to grow from 137.85 billion USD in 2017 to 231.94 billion USD by 2022, at a <strong>Compound Annual Growth Rate</strong> (<strong>CAGR</strong>) of 11.0 percent.</p>
<p>Security awareness training for employees is the most underspent sector of the cybersecurity industry. However, 91 percent of breaches start with a spear phishing attack. Therefore, the security awareness sector will become fundamental to cyber defense the strategies of Fortune 500 and Global 2000 corporations by 2021, with small businesses following shortly after that.</p>
<p><strong>What would you like to suggest to our readers who want to start a career in cybersecurity, and how can they do so?<br/></strong></p>
<p>To start a cybersecurity career, you don't need a background in it. However, many people beginning their career in cybersecurity come from related areas, such as systems or information administration.</p>
<p>There are lots of positions available, such as junior penetration testers, for example, who have little work experience, and can acquire knowledge and learn while on the job. Still, experience is a significant advantage, even though you might not have enough skills. Thus, to start a career in cybersecurity, taking an internship or volunteering for an organization is necessary.</p>
<p>Besides this, you should be reading blogs about cybersecurity trends as much as you can to see the most up-to-date developments in the industry and stay up to date with the freshest cybersecurity tips, as well as follow cybersecurity industry professionals on social networking platforms such as Twitter and Facebook, since many of them produce some useful tips and points on social media by engaging in discussions and responding to questions. Engaging with people and building relationships with them is a great way to get into the industry. Therefore, go to face-to-face meetings wherever possible, or use LinkedIn for networking. Also, find conferences to participate in, because they are great places to start relationships.</p>
<p>To gain an edge in your career in cybersecurity, you should also be qualified, which will depend on your career path. You might need to concentrate on the following certifications:</p>
<ul>
<li>Network+ Certification</li>
<li>Security+ Certification</li>
<li>Certified Ethical Hacker certification</li>
<li><strong>Certified Information Systems Security Professional</strong> (<strong>CISSP</strong>)</li>
<li><strong>Licensed Penetration Tester</strong> (<strong>LPT</strong>)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Do you suggest that someone should be an expert in one vertical of cybersecurity, or should they be an expert in every area of cybersecurity? What is your opinion from an industry perspective?</strong></p>
<p>Since cybersecurity is a broad domain, you can pursue your career path according to your own interests, because specializing in one area will give you an interest in going deeper and becoming more professional in your approach. For instance, at Keepnet Labs, we specialize in protecting businesses through the life cycle of email-based attacks. Specializing in protection against an email-based attack has led to us creating unique solutions in the market. People who want to build a career in cybersecurity can specialize in the following areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Application security</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>The cybersecurity landscape is ever-changing and extremely dynamic; how do you keep yourself up to date? What are your suggestions for our readers?</strong></p>
<p>Overlooking cybersecurity advancements, trends, and reports can distance you from serious updates that could impact your cybersecurity career. Also, data breaches are more prevalent today, and the best way to stay ahead of cybercriminals is to know about the latest scams and how to fight them.</p>
<p class="mce-root">To stay up to date, you should read news and blogs online about data breaches and cybersecurity trends daily. There are plenty of platforms that provide information on cybersecurity. Just do a Google search to get them. For instance, Keepnet Labs creates weekly cybersecurity briefings to keep users informed about cybersecurity news and developments, with tips on how to keep people safe from cyber attacks. It is possible to get these briefings automatically by subscribing to the newsletter platform on Keepnet.</p>
<p class="mce-root">Also, it is important to follow experts on social networking websites such as Twitter, LinkedIn, and others, and routinely examine the news and reports for points on data security.</p>
<p class="mce-root"><strong>In your view, what is more important: having a security certification, getting relevant security training, or gaining hands-on experience through a job?<br/></strong></p>
<p>Many young people who choose cybersecurity careers are network engineers or network administrators. However, to be a cybersecurity specialist, you do not have to have these backgrounds; anyone with the skills and experience can build a career in cybersecurity. For instance, to start a career in cybersecurity, you don't have to have a computer programming degree. Nevertheless, you need both experience and certification for a business career. Businesses are aware of the need to have skilled employees when hiring, so they give great importance to certifications on cybersecurity as one way of picking their candidates.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>To start a cybersecurity career, we agree that individuals need to have basic certifications. However, gaining hands-on experience through a job is more important, as people experience theoretical assumptions on a practical level, which will yield more perspicacity than certifications will deliver. Thus, as I mentioned earlier, to start a career in cybersecurity, taking an internship or volunteering for an organization is necessary.</p>
<p><strong>We all agree with the fact that cybersecurity is a non-negotiable factor of today's industry. As an industry leader, in your opinion, what are those new frontiers where cybersecurity will be needed in the near future?<br/></strong></p>
<p>Cybersecurity is thoroughly connected to the fate of information technology and the advancements in cyberspace and the digitization of the world. Taking into account the evolution of cyberspace today, it is obvious that the industry will grow bigger in our individual and business lives.</p>
<p>With the development of IoT devices and other technologies, many critical systems today are interconnected and run by different machines. This situation will grow, the bond between devices will be even tighter, and solutions will be more computerized and automated. IoT devices particularly will be an element of practically every aspect of our lives.</p>
<p>However, the complexity and interconnectivity of these machines and systems affects their level of susceptibility. When we look at the big picture, big financial organizations and government institutions can be targets for hackers, despite the fact that they will continue to develop ways to defend against cyber attacks. Big financial organizations will be targets because they are accessible from every location in the world, and an attacker with the motivation of financial gain can attack from a distance. Also, governments will be at risk from enemy states who could launch cyber attacks anonymously on institutions of the target country to infiltrate the entire network or system for various purposes.</p>
<p>Hacktivists, terrorist groups, and states who are active in cyberspace due to the evolution of technology can pose a danger to the cybersecurity ecosystem, with different motivations. Cybersecurity defence systems will need to become more smart and sophisticated to cope with the new threat vectors appearing every day.</p>
<p><strong>At Keepnet Labs, what criteria do you look for before you decide to hire talent?<br/></strong></p>
<p class="mce-root">Cybersecurity jobs are in high demand, and selecting the candidate with the best ability can be a hurdle. Once we get applications, we consider some important factors when selecting talent.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root">Experience is the primary determinant for us to consider cybersecurity talent. If applicants have expertise in related fields, they will stand a reasonable chance of success within our company, since they have proven that they have been successful before. It is essential for us to decide between an applicant with experience over someone without experience.</p>
<p class="mce-root">However, we know that experience, practice, and knowledge are not everything. Candidates who show potential can sometimes be more valuable than people who are more experienced on paper. Therefore, when interviewing candidates, we may meet people who look promising, but don't have experience. They may be new university graduates or people who graduated at the top of their class from an authorized university in the field. Those candidates haven't proven themselves at work yet but they have high potential.</p>
<p class="mce-root">One of the other criteria we look for is an applicant's skill base. Because, if applicants don't have the appropriate abilities, they have to get job training. For instance, we may require some certifications, such as CEH, CRISC, CISM, or CISSP.</p>
<p class="mce-root">Besides raw skills, we also look for soft skills such as communication skills, work ethics, and being a team player.</p>
<p>When hiring new talent, we also evaluate their dedication to developing their career in cybersecurity. We look for employees who are going to be faithful to our company, and who will see the job as a chance to develop their career and be a valuable asset to Keepnet at the same time.</p>
<p>Furthermore, one of the best methods to get the best talent for the job is hiring interns, because we can monitor their progress and skills and get to know them much better than in any interview.</p>
<p><strong>Why should people join Keepnet? What career development opportunities do you provide?<br/></strong></p>

<p>Security Lead at ZeroFOX</p>
<p><strong>What was your career in before making a switch to cybersecurity?</strong></p>
<p>Unlike many professionals in the current field, I started my career in the cybersecurity industry.</p>
<p><strong>Tell us about your journey transitioning from your primary career to cybersecurity.</strong></p>
<p>By the end of high school, I had established my aptitude for computing, and security in particular. Like many students in such a situation, I was advised to seek a degree in computer science. Upon arriving at university, I was surprised to find out that they had started a dedicated computing security degree that very year. Given my passion for the subject, I enrolled in the new program which, after graduating, led to my career in cybersecurity.</p>
<p><strong>Why did you choose a career in cybersecurity?</strong></p>
<p>In short, passion. I had always been interested and practiced the topic before I realized that it could become a lucrative career.</p>
<p><strong>Share your views and thoughts for those who want to be part of the cybersecurity industry.</strong></p>
<p>The industry is not for the weak-willed. As a professor, I occasionally happen upon students or parents who will talk chiefly about the opportunity for compensation. While there is certainly money in the field, it is important to remember that cybersecurity is a constantly evolving industry that requires tremendous effort to master and subsequently remain up to date with. Without this investment of time and energy, failure—or at least failure to advance—is a very likely possibility.</p>
<p><strong>What would you like to suggest to our readers who want to start a career in cybersecurity, and how can they do so?</strong></p>
<p>Cybersecurity is a fantastically interesting and entertaining field that is just now starting to mature. Unlike other careers, its relative youth means that there is always plenty to learn, and new tools and techniques are becoming public daily. My suggestion is to get involved in the cybersecurity community. More than most industries, security provides for an open and nurturing community that is there to both teach you and empower you as you develop.</p>
<p><strong>Do you suggest that someone should be expert in one vertical of cybersecurity or should they be an expert in every domain of cybersecurity? What is your opinion from an industry perspective?</strong></p>
<p>Becoming an expert in one field is a common occurrence; however, the most successful security practitioners have a well-laid foundation of the principles and are able to speak to and, if needed, pivot to other areas within the industry. More generally, I find that most successful members of our industry have a limited few areas where they don't focus, rather than restricting themselves to just one vertical.</p>
<p><strong>The cybersecurity landscape is ever-changing and extremely dynamic, how do you keep yourself updated? What are your suggestions for our readers?</strong></p>
<p>Staying up to date should be an outcome of your love of the topic. This can involve reading the news, books, conferences, training, and more. I find that the more engaged with the community you can be, the easier it is to stay on top of advances.</p>
<p><strong>In your view, what is more important: having a security certification, getting the relevant security training, or gaining hands-on experience through a job?</strong></p>
<p>Without a doubt, hands-on experience is the most useful background to have when it comes to any job. Think about security as if it were driving. While sitting through a driver's education course and getting a driver's license is part of the equation, they simply indicate that you have the minimum set of capabilities to drive a car. It is the years of practice and experience that make you a good (or a bad) driver.</p>
<p><strong>We all agree to the fact that cybersecurity is a non-negotiable factor of today's industries. As an industry leader, in your opinion, what are those new frontiers where cybersecurity will be needed in the near future?</strong></p>
<p>I think we will continue to see a place for the traditional offensive and defensive security engineering positions. However, there are some areas that we, as an industry, have underperformed in. Two of the weakest areas are data analytics and development. Often, these two go hand-in-hand, either working on automating complicated problems or making new products. We can be sure that there will be continued growth and demand for these skills. The other area that is just starting to really take shape is a more involved role for technical security individuals in legal and policy matters. This is being driven both by recent regulations around privacy, such as GDPR, but also by third parties that require basic levels of technical security controls and auditing, such as via SOC2.</p>

<p><strong>The cybersecurity journey—where do I start?</strong></p>
<p>If, in the past, the struggle to get into the information security (because it wasn't really called cybersecurity) field was due to lack of information, today, we have exactly the opposite: a tsunami of information. In the past, you just couldn't really find anything; it was almost like a dark market, and now it is fully mainstream. I believe that today's situation is much better from a self-learning perspective, as today you can easily create a lab environment to simulate attacks on your own machine, or in a cloud-based environment. Books are widely available, free online materials are usually of good quality, and there are far more target security certifications. So, if everything seems so good, why is it still so hard to start working in this field? I could give many reasons, but I will start with the two main ones: the level of competition and the (infamous) previous experience in the job. Let's see what can be done to overcome those.</p>
<p>An information security career has many ramifications, from a very specialized pentester to a security analyst who needs to know a variety of topics about security. This means that the first step that you should take is to perform a self-assessment and decide where you want to go in your career. What do you like to do and how can you advance in that particular field? This is an important point because, often, a professional decides what they will do based solely on the market's demand. Blindly following this rationale can be dangerous, because you might end up working in a field that you don't like, and that will have a negative impact on how you grow in your position. As a result, you will not evolve and, sooner or later, you will start looking for another job. Regardless of what pays more, you must be passionate about what you are going to embrace in your next career move. Some security professionals are already in this situation, having to work in an area of this field where they don't feel passionate; the rationale is the same: find your next career move by doing this self-assessment and discover what motivates you. Nowadays, everyone talks about <em>hacking</em>, <em>ethical hacking</em>, <em>cybersecurity,</em> and other terms. Don't let the buzz distract you; understand deeply what you want to do and pursue the right path for your next move.</p>
<p>Once you decide which path you will take, evaluate what you already have to offer. In general, there are three core components that you must assess regarding the field that you are going to work in:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Experience</strong>: Do you have the required experience in that field?</li>
<li><strong>Professional certification</strong>: Do you have the professional certifications that are required for the job that you are looking for?</li>
<li><strong>Degree</strong>: Do you have a degree that will be helpful in that field?</li>
</ul>
<p>This self-assessment is very important to allow you to understand your strengths and weaknesses. The goal is to ensure that, once you detect your weaknesses, you start working on a plan to fill those gaps. If the result of this self-assessment shows that you need a specific certification in order to be more competitive, then you already know what to do: study and obtain the certification.</p>
<p>A survey performed by SANS in 2014 shows that experience is a key factor for a better salary in the information security field. The same survey also reveals that certification is a critical component for career success in the information security arena. What should we conclude from this? Having both is the best scenario for a security professional. While experience is, for the most part, directly related to the jobs that you had in that field, you can also obtain experience by attending training conferences and helping your community. Initiatives such as Security BSides are available in many locations around the world. You could propose a presentation for one of their meetings or you could volunteer to work at their meetings. By engaging yourself in communities like this, you will gain knowledge and you will also expand your network.</p>
<p>I've been teaching the bachelor of science in cybersecurity and the master of science in cybersecurity at EC-Council University since 2015, and every year I have a good mix of students who are already in the market and ones who are brand new. What they have in common is that they are all pursuing a university-level degree in the field. I'm truly a believer in studying to your foundational knowledge about something, and getting credentials to validate your skills; credentials will be the most useful in this market. Keep in mind that credentials via certification or degrees do not give any guarantees that you will rapidly get a promotion (if you are already in the field) or a job in the field. What you need to understand and focus on is that there are things you have control over (pursuing a better education in the field) and things that you don't have control over (getting a job, for example). By doing your homework, you increase the likelihood of a positive outcome, so make sure you do your homework!</p>
<p>Now that you understand the general considerations regarding which path you should take, how to choose it, and the generalist/specialist dilemma, it is important to build your security foundation. If you are new to this area and you want to know what you should learn about security, the best advice is to obtain a vendor-neutral certification, such as CompTIA Security+. The current exam (SY0-501) is very broad, because it covers subjects such as BYOD, SCADA, Incident Response, and other topics that are relevant for anyone who wants to either start working in security or boost their security career by obtaining a vendor-neutral certification.</p>
<p>One of the advantages of starting with a broad certification in the security field is that you can decide which area you want to focus on in if you want to specialize in something; for example, after obtaining this certification, you might conclude that you want to invest more time and effort into becoming a computer forensics analyst. If that's your choice, you could start with <strong>GIAC</strong> <strong>Certified Forensic Analyst</strong> (<strong>GCFA</strong>) or EC-Council's <strong>C|HFI</strong> (<strong>Computer-Hacking Forensics Investigator</strong>). The reasons that will lead you to choose one certification over another can vary; it could be job requirements, financial restrictions, and so on. It is important to research and to verify what certification will aggregate more valuenot only on your resume, but also your own knowledge. What you learn throughout the preparation phase is vital, because if you are going to spend hours and hours studying for an exam, you better like the subject and be very passionate about what you are about to embrace.</p>
<p>If IT is already a very dynamic field, information security is even more challenging, because it changes on a daily basis and one change can cause collateral damage in different areas. Be aware that these challenges can be overwhelming but they are also full of opportunities to highlight the quality of your work. As with anything you do in life, progressing in this field becomes easier if you are passionate, self-driven, and have discipline to pursue your vision of what you want for your career. Make sure that you participate and network with other professionals, because this will help you to identify areas that you can explore further and will offer real-world scenarios that you might not be exposed to if you are working on your own.</p>
<p>Last but not least, follow this simple advice and stay hungry for knowledge:</p>

<p><strong>What was your career in before making the switch to cybersecurity?</strong></p>
<p>Compared to today's cyber-teen generation, I spent my childhood counting fighter jets and tomahawks that were flying across the Balkan sky daily, praying the given coordinates were precise, guiding the tomahawks to the right targets. I took my first steps in the field of security at the Military Academy General Mihailo Apostolski, Skopje, Macedonia, studying aviation. As the first generation that was trained and educated according to NATO standards, luck turned its back on us. Due to the transition of the army and security structures, the entire generation of graduated lieutenants changed course from the military to civilian life. I started studying political science at the Iustinianus Primus Faculty of Law at the University of St. Cyril and Methodius in Skopje, where, in 2011, I successfully defended my doctoral dissertation in the field of politics and security. Earlier, in 2008, I started my career as an independent intelligence officer in the Financial Intelligence Office, a position I'm still active in today. My main duty is to analyze suspicious transactions related to money laundering and terrorism financing, as well as the implementation of international restrictive measures. Within the scope of my duties, I am a member of the National Committee for Countering Violent Extremism and Counter-Terrorism in the Republic of North Macedonia, the working group for <em>Chapter 24 - Justice, Freedom, and Security</em>, which has an obligation to harmonize domestic legislation with European legislation.</p>

<p>Knowing and discovering the way in which criminals use cyberspace in order to generate proceeds of crime has imposed the need for its study. Only through such an approach can you understand the psychology of criminals, why and for what purposes they use cyberspace, what methods of attacks they use, and how they choose their targets. Naturally, I started independently by studying legislation, researching the norms and standards, as well as investigating cyber crime cases. I have to admit, the internet has played a major role in this. Afterwards, together with my esteemed friends, associates, and colleagues, we established the <strong>Cybersecurity Corporate Security and Crisis Management Initiative</strong> (<strong>C3I</strong>) in Skopje, through which we accomplished several projects concerned with building a cyber resilient society. C3I started cooperating with private institutions, especially financial institutions, through education and printing instruction materials intended for clients in order to inform them about the risks and threats of cyber crime and ways to protect themselves. There is a saying that if you are not able to share your knowledge outside, then you will not be able to share it at home either. I was elected an honorary member of the nonprofit organization Cyber ​​Security Research Center – Global in Istanbul, Turkey, which is a unique research center focusing on the effects of cybersecurity threats on societies. For 4 years, I have been a lecturer at the Academy of Banking and Information Technology, where financial workers are educated and introduced, among other things, to cyber crime and security.</p>
<p><strong>Why did you choose a career in cybersecurity?</strong></p>
<p>Internet technologies become continuously more advanced, and so do the ways in which criminals utilize them for their illicit and illegal activities. Among these technologies, digital currencies are transforming the criminal underworld. They are also a powerful new tool for criminals and terrorist financiers to convert, remit, and conceal illicit funds from law enforcement authorities. There is a clear consensus that digital currencies pose a money laundering and terrorism financing threat. A small number of cases have already shown law enforcement agencies that money laundering and terrorism financing can easily take place inside virtual environments, offering high levels of anonymity and low levels of detection, removing many of the risks associated with real-world money laundering and terrorism financing activities. On the other hand, the introduction and distribution of new products into the banking system is an open field where criminals have found a solution to commit criminal activities and abuse.</p>

<p>The most common risks to a financial institution that offers e-banking services and users of e-banking services are internet fraud, harmful software, <strong>Advanced Persistent Threat</strong> (<strong>APT</strong>), payment card fraud, and DDoS attacks on critical financial information infrastructure. These actions represent offenses in which the offender may acquire illegal profit. In order to conceal the source of illegal property (usually in the form of cash), the perpetrator puts the cash into the financial system and pursues a process of money laundering. The role of public and private partnership, which means cooperation between the private sector and law enforcement, is of great importance in the early detection of suspicious persons or transactions that deviate from daily operations. A public-private partnership must set up an ambush. They wait for terrorists and their supporters to make the smallest mistakes in order to reveal their identity and purpose. We always need luck to not get hacked, but hackers need it only once to break into a system.</p>
<p>My first task is to prevent cyber crime by setting up standards and legal framework, and thus building a cyber crime-resistant society. My second task is to detect, identify, and lead investigations related to cyber crime, money laundering, and terrorist financing.</p>
<p><strong>What did you do differently than your peers when choosing cybersecurity as your career?</strong></p>
<p>As I have said, I haven't made a full career switch, but a career update. I have never stopped my schooling and research. The study of an unknown subject (cybersecurity) required dedication, love, and desire to discover new things. By doing this, you acquire new knowledge that will make you more recognizable and competitive in the job market.</p>
<p><strong>Can you please share your views and thoughts for those who want to be part of the cybersecurity industry?</strong></p>
<p>Whether we like it or not, the environment itself imposes the need to keep pace with the development of technology, and therefore cybersecurity. Cybersecurity is a wide area. Certainly, depending on your background, you need to determine which area of cybersecurity you will be researching. To be more successful, focus on the area that will help you upgrade your career.</p>
<p><strong>In your opinion, how is your old career helping or influencing you on your cybersecurity journey?</strong></p>
<p>As I described, trying to understand the psychology of criminals in order to discover why and for what purposes they use cyberspace, and creating cybersecurity based on that, imposes the need for it. I will mention again that there is no old or new career here, but an upgrade of my old career. From a practical point of view, as a financial analyst, you will never find a criminal who, through cyber crime, acquired proceeds while using virtual wallets, currencies, and channels for transferring proceeds of crime.</p>
<p><strong>What would you like to suggest to our readers who want to start a career in cybersecurity, and how can they do so?</strong></p>
<p>The first thing they need to do is explore cybersecurity and focus on the area they feel will be able to help them with their career. Of course, further education should be carried out systematically, from studying norms and standards to exploring practical functionalities and ways of functioning. I am speaking from the aspect of detecting the financial crime that takes place in cyberspace, which, according to all surveys, is common among cyber criminals. Certainly, the main aspect is discovering the weaknesses of the internet and technology products, such as smartphones, tablets, computers, POS terminals, ATM machines, e-banking, and so on. Of course, all of these products and services are used by people. Do these products offer full protection of users' personal information, and how can personal information be stolen and misused (identity theft, phishing, pharming attacks, and so on)?</p>
<p><strong>Do you suggest that someone should be an expert in one vertical of cybersecurity or should they be an expert in every domain of cybersecurity? What is your opinion from an industry perspective?</strong></p>
<p>I already mentioned that cybersecurity is a wide area. It is not possible to be a cyber expert in the financial and the military field at the same time; these are two different areas. Perhaps upgrading the platform is common, but later they will have to redirect to the area they feel is most suitable for them, that is, in which they can build a career as a cyber expert. The development of cybersecurity is so dynamic that it is virtually impossible to explore both areas simultaneously. Or, in a nutshell, tomorrow makes a distant past of the present day in terms of the development of technology and the opportunities that emerge from it.</p>
<p><strong>The cybersecurity landscape is ever-changing and extremely dynamic; how do you keep yourself updated? What are your suggestions for our readers?</strong></p>
<p>The area of cybersecurity is a constantly evolving one, which raises the question of whether infinity is the limit. It requires continual reading and researching, following new trends and practices. This will enable you to observe and detect cyberspace's weaknesses, which can be used by criminals for their purposes. If conditions allow it, it is necessary to participate in seminars, conferences, workshops, and forums in which the main topic is cybersecurity.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p><strong>In your view, what is more important: having a cybersecurity certification, getting the relevant security training, or gaining hands-on experience through a job?</strong></p>
<p>Could you drive your car without a driver's license? Yes, if someone teaches you how to drive. But would you be able to recognize traffic signs, and would you acquire driving etiquette? No, because you need to pass the tests. It's the same with cybersecurity. Theory without practice is not functional. Practice without theory is not innovative. This means both are necessary to make a whole. I always say to my students that non-formal education today is just as important as formal university education. The formal education will give you the basis, but practice in correlation with non-formal education will direct you in a certain area of cybersecurity.</p>
<p><strong>Can you give us an example of an organization that needs cybersecurity even more than others?</strong></p>
<p>Definitely, yes! I will speak from the aspect of the financial sector as it is the sector most abused by criminals in order to generate proceeds. Virtual currencies have further slowed down the process of detection, monitoring, freezing, and confiscation. Therefore, the focus of cybersecurity within the financial sector is directed toward these aspects. Well-known cases such as <strong>Carbanak</strong>, <strong>Mariposa</strong>, and many others, where banks and their clients were directly threatened, only stress the need for enhanced cybersecurity in this sector. An additional problem is the lack of awareness of the risks posed by cyberspace. This is especially true for companies that are export- and import-oriented. Following investigations, they are the most affected at the moment. Their correspondence with foreign partners is often intercepted and modified by criminals, causing financial damage.</p>

<p><strong>Recommendations to cybersecurity beginners</strong></p>
<p>Every year, there is a growing number of news stories about data breaches, cyberattacks, corporate cyber espionage, hacktivism, or cyberterrorism threatening organizations all around the world. That news is not only spreading across specialized websites, news channels, podcasts, or digital newspapers related to information technology, but reaching mass media, which is making cybersecurity a hot topic among everyone. So, it is not a surprise that more and more young students, as well as employees, want to have a career in cybersecurity.</p>
<p>IT employees are already in high demand as it is—adding in the element of security makes them even more sought after. According to ISACA, a nonprofit information security advocacy group, there is a global shortage of 2 million cybersecurity professionals already in 2019. Combine this with the predictions of the US Bureau of Labor Statistics that the growth rate for information security positions will be 37 percent greater than the average of other positions and we have practically zero-percent unemployment for those who choose this career path!</p>
<p>At CQURE, as one of the leading providers of specialized services in IT infrastructure security, business applications, and consulting and advisory services, with more than 10 years of experience, we noticed that trend a few years ago and started our own CQURE Academy, where we turn new adepts into security experts through a set of authored training.</p>
<p>Moreover, as a responsible organization gathering a group of enthusiastic and charismatic experts, we share our security knowledge, tools, examples, experience, and fun with others at the most important conferences all over the world. It has been during those events that, multiple times, we have been asked what the best way is to start a journey into the exciting world of cybersecurity. How can you boost your career? How do you follow the trends and learn about new threats and ways of mitigating them?</p>
<p>To answer those questions, you need to ask yourself what the current state of your knowledge and expertise is. Are you a rookie with no basic knowledge in computer science, or are you currently working in the IT field? It is important to realize that an academic background must not necessarily be related to engineering or information technology, although in most cases, that helps to understand how technology is used and to get a better perspective of the overall process of digital transformations in organizations.</p>
<p>So, what does it take to be successful in cybersecurity? It is all about having the right mindset, skills, and knowledge.</p>
<p>First comes the mindset. As a child, did you ever wonder how toys worked and try to disassemble them, or try to make modifications that would make them go faster, or do tricks that the maker did not design them for? Yes, that's probably what all of us did; yet some of us are lucky enough to be doing those same things in our work life. Whenever we get a new piece of software or we are in a new environment and someone is trying to convince us that it is secure or how it works, we simply don't take it for granted! There is no way we will pass by a chance of looking behind the scenes: checking the source code, testing different payloads, or sniffing the network traffic. If you ask someone <em>"Can it be done, hacked, or bypassed?",</em> just don't take <em>"no"</em> for an answer.</p>
<p>This mindset, in general, will drive you through these new cybersecurity areas, and it is always inside us when we want to crack something, and we always want to be up to date. These two things drive us pretty much every day to discover something new.</p>
<p>If you are one of those people who likes to follow the news and likes to know more and more every day, and when there is something new coming up, you are like <em>"Oh, I didn't know that; let me dig in,"</em> then that's definitely an appropriate mindset. And, don't worry—it's not something that you can only be born with; obviously, it's something that you need to work on.</p>
<p>You must also pay attention to the details and be systematic and persistent. It takes lots of time, learning, and practice to advance in cybersecurity, as this field requires knowledge from many different areas.</p>
<p>This brings us to the second and third requirements, which are skillset and knowledge. While pursuing a cybersecurity career, you should become familiar with multiple domains:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hardware and software architecture</li>
<li>Programming languages</li>
<li>Cryptography</li>
<li>Networking</li>
<li>Operating systems</li>
</ul>
<p>This is, of course, just a glimpse of what you should build a strong basis of for further development; a glimpse into many possible specializations as a security analyst, architect, pentester, auditor, secure software developer, and so on.</p>
<p>I myself started my career as a software developer, just to become a system and database administrator, and finally moved toward security. Every time I switched to a new job role, I was thinking how this position requires me to get broader knowledge from even more disciplines than the previous one; that is, until I found myself in the security space, where, now, I'm convinced there are no limits to the number of topics you can learn and benefit from.</p>
<p>Remember that, at first, you don't need to be an expert in any domain, and you probably will never become a cryptographer or a hardware designer, but for every security professional it is crucial to understand and connect many completely different parts of infrastructure and computer science.</p>
<p>From our experience, we have seen that the biggest breaches and successful attacks occur mostly through a combination of multiple misconfigurations, mistakes, and events chained together that, separately, do not pose a huge threat. It's the same with plane crashes—a single failure will not bring an airplane down, but a combination of many unforeseen factors may have catastrophic results. Our goal as security experts is to think out of the box and connect many dots together before someone else does.</p>
<p>CQURE specializes first and foremost in Windows-oriented environments, so we have been asking ourselves what the necessary sets of hard skills are that a security specialist working in this environment should have. We came up with 10 groups of these:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows internals</li>
<li>Managing identity and access in Windows systems</li>
<li>Managing infrastructure services</li>
<li>Securing Windows networks</li>
<li>Application whitelisting</li>
<li>Practical cryptography</li>
<li>High availability</li>
<li>Scripting and automation</li>
<li>Monitoring and troubleshooting Windows systems</li>
<li>Pentesting</li>
</ul>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>When going into Windows security, you should start with the basics and core information in order to understand how your operating system really works, understand threads, processes and services, memory management, and how code is executed. Next, move to one of the key aspects of security—identity and access management—to get insights into permissions, access control, object protection, and system privileges.</p>
<p>After that, you'll be ready for core Windows infrastructure services, including DNS, DHCP, Active Directory Domain Services, Internal Public Key Infrastructure, and even the popular database server, Microsoft SQL Server. You should understand what the purpose of each of these is and the key security concepts related to them, as well as what the common mistakes made by administrators are and what to look for when you perform audits or penetration tests. These are the same things that attackers look for.</p>
<p>Network security and understanding the most important protocols used in Windows networking and common services is the next goal for you to achieve. Focus on protocols used to transfer data such as TDS, SMB, and FTP, and those that are related to name resolution and remote authentication.</p>
<p>When you already know how to work with Windows Server and its core services, it's time to focus on hardening workstations, as most common kill chains start by compromising the user's workstation. Understanding how malware avoids detection, spreads, and takes control of your system will be crucial for you. You also need to know how to prevent it from even starting by implementing successful application whitelisting and code-execution prevention techniques. You'll need some practical cryptography knowledge and to find out how to protect your precious data with BitLocker drive encryption. Moreover, get to know how Windows protects your secrets, passwords, and other content with DPAPI. Here, we are true experts, as CQURE Team was the first to fully reverse engineer the Windows Data Protection API and we made a few surprising discoveries!</p>
<p>You should already know how to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of your data and systems, but there is still more to learn, as the last component of security is availability: how to ensure that your systems are still working during or after an attack. You should be able to understand virtualization, failover clustering, and other technologies. At this point, don't forget about disaster recovery and how to prepare for the worst.</p>
<p>The next part of the skill set is making your day-to-day working life easier. You need to know how to become a real scripting and automation ninja. This will reduce the number of mistakes you make and give you more time to learn new stuff. You must understand how to use PowerShell, write your own scripts, use just enough administration for delegation, and automate everything with Desired State Configuration and Group Policy Objects.</p>
<p>Finally, we have the monitoring and troubleshooting of infrastructure. Proper monitoring and getting correct insights from your infrastructure without unnecessary noise will assure that an intruder will be detected quickly and easily stopped, or, in a worst-case scenario, after a breach, you will know how it happened so you will be better prepared next time.</p>
<p>Additionally, we would like to add penetration testing as a necessary skill group that's not only related to Windows. It represents knowledge about operating system internals, combined with various tools to exploit system services, vulnerabilities, and misconfigurations.</p>
<p>While we have been working with our customers and delivering other specialized masterclasses focusing on just one topic, we realize the need to define this kind of fast track to get new practitioners into the cybersecurity sector as it is expanding rapidly, fueled by the growth in demand from businesses who want to feel secure. We created an online 30-day intense course to give a really good set of ideas, insights, and core knowledge in all the aforementioned skillset groups. Up until now, this has been a great success and we are proud that many of our trainees have started successful careers and are progressing in the cybersecurity world.</p>
<p>So, you already know how you should frame your thoughts and what you should learn and practice. Now, there is the question of how to do it. First of all, find what your best way of learning is. Is it online training, an instructor-led on-premises class, or maybe reading books and watching video tutorials? It's up to you, but remember: you must practice thoroughly. Build your test environment or rent one in the cloud and get hands-on lab experience.</p>
<p>A great way to stay up to date with the newest technology or threats is to follow multiple security researchers, experts, and companies on Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, and YouTube. CQURE and our team members are contributing to the cybersecurity community on all social media, constantly sharing our knowledge directly from the battlefield against cyberattacks.</p>
<p>If you would like to know about useful books, I would recommend <em>Windows Internals</em> by Mark Russinovich, because it is a book that describes internals in a way that every cybersecurity professional should know. Although, at first, it might be difficult to keep up with the content, going slowly through the book and learning everything that you need to fully understand it will guide you to cybersecurity mastery.</p>
<p>In the end, it's a lot of work and it's a never-ending story. Yet, acquiring the right curiosity-driven approach will help you gain the right skill set, as in cybersecurity knowledge, the sky is the limit. Stay CQURE!</p>

<p>Cybersecurity Consultant, Microsoft</p>
<p><strong>The road to cybersecurity</strong></p>
<p>Much like the adage <em>"the road to hell is paved with good intentions,"</em> so too can be the journey of a budding cybersecurity professional. The ability to adapt to varying environments and circumstances is key to anyone who is seeking to go down the path of a cybersecurity professional. The biggest learning factor through my career path in the security profession is that security can normally be trumped by a business's need to perform! This is normally a big blow to any individual that has the passion to secure a business, only to be halted at the next meeting, project review, development discussion, or just plain corridor talk, for many varying factors.</p>
<p>When I started along my journey, there were many things I had to learn, and I had to double- and triple-check to make sure I was getting it right. This industry has changed from a <em>no</em> business to a <em>let's make this work, however, securely</em> business<em>.</em> Whether you are talking to technicians, architects, managers, directors, or even end users, none of these people will quite understand the passion behind your convictions to get a product or environment as secure as possible – that is, until disaster strikes or it is looming in the background.</p>
<p><strong>Knowing the limits</strong></p>
<p>My first bit of advice would be to know yourself, and to know your own limits. There are plenty of individuals in the cybersecurity industry, and I haven't met one who knows everything. This field is miles long and plenty deep, all depending on which path you choose. The many facets of the industry can be very rewarding if you know what you enjoy and what will keep you going. Puzzles, challenges, mystery, intrigue, and even romance, can all be expected in this field, a cliché never the less out of a novel or even a movie, yet all these things can be experienced in a moment or over a period of time.</p>
<p>Forensics, compliance, breaching, testing, analytics, or even design, are all pieces of a larger puzzle that encompass this vast subject called cybersecurity. The question that most people ask when they hear about what I do is "<em>How can I get into that?"</em> or "<em>What should I study to do security?"</em> Many a time, I have been left pondering the correct answer to give, only to think about my journey to this career path. This can be a discussion that goes on for minutes or hours as I sit and describe all the exciting options that cybersecurity has to try to guide you in the right direction. Sometimes, it's a simple question of, do you prefer to read or watch movies? And, out of the those, what is your favorite genre?</p>
<p>This is a general guideline of where you could see yourself within the field of cybersecurity. The following are some of the exciting roles and brief descriptions that can await you, just to name a few:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Application security:</strong> A continually growing field, with exciting challenges and tremendous rigor. This can have you thinking about software integration, development life cycles, vulnerability management, or simply how security will feature in the application itself. The ability to learn as the world changes around you and how to adapt to those changes will see an individual soar in this field.</li>
<li><strong>Cloud security:</strong> With all things moving to the cloud, the call to have better controls and security around this will be on the up and up. This is no longer a pipe dream, and the ability to make sure that all requirements are met for varying frameworks, laws, and customer requirements is a big must. IoT will be your best friend and will definitely challenge you.</li>
<li><strong>Cryptography:</strong> Does your mind work at a mile a minute? Can you make up secret languages, or decipher them quickly? Then this is where you would want to be. In a world where your PlayStation 3 can be clustered and used to break encryption (Dumitrescu, 2009), the need for better encryption and encryption methodologies are always welcome. This career path can see you working in top-secret organizations or defense contracts.</li>
<li><strong>Forensics:</strong> Your typical <em>who dunnit</em> scenario or murder mystery. Whether you go corporate or law enforcement, your ability to solve puzzles will be key. Sometimes, it will be as easy as spotting Waldo in a snow field standing alone, or as tough as trying to find him in at a Father Christmas convention. Your ability to do things methodically and with due diligence will be a great asset to you as you could be called to testify as a witness.</li>
<li><strong>Information security:</strong> Protection information while it is a rest or in motion can be called for in many regards, whether it be Yahoo's data breach of 3 billion accounts in 2014 (Armerding, 2018) or some small database from the local medical practice. Information is sacred to someone and can have dire consequences if it's in the wrong hands. Various industries have varying standards on how to protect information. Financial, personal, or just trade secrets, it could be your responsibility to make sure that it remains safe and secure from leaking. This could even mean that you deploy technologies to prevent leaks from occurring from within an organization.</li>
<li><strong>Mobile security:</strong> Nearly everyone in a corporate environment has a mobile device. These devices are powerful handheld computers that can be used to steal information, infiltrate a meeting, or just plain cause malicious harm to its end user. Companies require their staff to be productive while mobile, but not at the expense of information or access. Where alarming numbers of mobile devices are being left in taxis in the UK alone (Peyer, 2014), the potential of any of those devices to contain company data is very high. You would need to know how to secure and segregate company data versus private data on a single device and be prepared to wipe the device remotely if possible.</li>
<li><strong>Network security:</strong> Your initial start to this part of the industry can be slow, as many people will not let a rookie loose on their production environment. With different vendors in this space, you will have options to venture through, but as you master this technically, your expertise will be sought after and consulted upon for design and security considerations. Firewalls with deep packet inspection, direct access, VPNs, and even detection and prevention mechanisms of the data traversing in, out, and around your network could be controlled by you. You would be an information traffic cop, if you will.</li>
<li><strong>Penetration testing:</strong> You know the bad guys we are trying to protect systems from? Well, it would be your role to simulate those guys within known or unknown environments to try to ascertain whether there are known weaknesses on a system that could be exploited. Thinking on your feet to try and break into a system and get the data or the highest level of privilege possible would be your goal. You could use your smarts and code an exploit or simply your charm to get onto the system. However you do it, it is up to you, but the goal is getting access! As a penetration tester, you will help by finding gaps in the security already established for systems and thereby inform organizations or other security individuals about said gaps so that they can be mitigated before the system goes live.</li>
<li><strong>Risk management:</strong> This is about recording and tracking all known security risks to an organization. Even though this may not sound exciting, it is key to understand the potential threat or losses that could occur due to open risks. What is the likelihood of such an occurrence happening? Research and industry knowledge will be key here. This role is tied to business continuity and consultation on most security incidents.</li>
<li><strong>Security analysts:</strong> Breaches, false positives, events, and pages of data is what will await you here, for example. Trying to determine where a malware originated from, who coded it, or whether it was just a hoax. As an analyst, you can be part of the <strong>Security Operations Center</strong> (<strong>SOC</strong>) or an incident response team. Understanding data flow, methods of compromise, or just what looks abnormal, your in-depth knowledge will point you in the direction of potential or existing threats. This can very much be a detective role with a cowboy outlook, stopping bad guys at the source.</li>
<li><strong>Security auditing and compliance:</strong> Are you the kind of person who loves following the rules, and enjoys making sure that others do too? Well then, this role will suit your needs. Different frameworks, legislation, and standards are adhered to or must be followed through most industries and organizations. Things such as the Payment Card Industry for dealing with credit or debit cards, VISA, MasterCard, and Amex will adhere to the standards and require anyone issuing their cards to do the same. You will make sure that these frameworks are being followed and adhered to, making sure that the minimum level of security set by those standards, frameworks, or legislation is being used within the organization. It is when the rules are not being followed that the auditing comes in and brings this to the attention of the directors. Auditors can do manual or automated checks to help find these discrepancies.</li>
<li><strong>Security operations:</strong> This is your man-on-the-ground role. You may need to implement a fix to mitigate a problem penetration testers have found, close a gap discovered by an auditor due to non-compliance, or find a solution to reduce a risk that has been plaguing the risk management team. Welcome to the firefighting team. This role will keep you busy, and your learning curve will be exponential and rewarding. Though you might never be a master of a specific listed field, you can certainly excel in other ways. Things such as identity management, technical controls, centralized management, and deployment techniques could all stand you in good stead along your path. You will eventually deal with all of the cybersecurity roles to a certain degree. Your broad knowledge will have you challenging even physical security concerns.</li>
</ul>
<p>The listed roles provide a glimpse of the skills or mindset you might require to fulfill those roles. Bear in mind that these roles could be fluid and ever-changing, adapting to the times and the situation you are in. Remember what I said at the beginning of this chapter: have the ability to adapt. Keeping that in mind, the industry has a lot of certifications to help aspiring cybersecurity professionals. The problem, is which ones should you take and how will they help you? This is another question that is asked of most cyber professionals, and there can be many opinions on the matter. I also know of many individuals that are not certified in any of the well-known certifications, but are, however, still very knowledgeable in their areas of expertise.</p>
<p>I would suggest that, depending on your level of knowledge of the industry, number of years in the industry, years of study, and, of course, knowing your probability to fall into a certain role, that you investigate the known certifications houses and see what offerings they have from beginner to expert level. See which appeals to you or where you would like to focus your interest. Also, look to the job boards to see the role you are looking for and what the certification requirements are, if any. Some certifications have a practical requirement, which requires you to demonstrate the knowledge that you have learned in a simulated environment over a standard test. Where possible, practice building labs with friends or family that have the same interests and learn; you will be surprised at just how much you will know after you rebuild that lab for the tenth time due to an incorrect security setting, or a failed simulation.</p>
<p>In my case, I had already been in the <strong>Information Communications Technology</strong> (<strong>ICT</strong>) industry for 10 years before my interests led to cybersecurity. Although security was always something in the back of my mind, it became more imminent when threats where causing late-night work and presumed on-call work. Viruses such as the ILOVEYOU virus in 2000, which brought down email systems, or the Conficker worm in 2008 and Stuxnet in 2010, really tested the resolve of cybersecurity teams.</p>
<p>Its through scares such as these and the needs of the organization I was in at the time that drove me to look to names in the industry and follow principles. When tackling any identity-related security, I always looked at principles of least privilege as a starting point, and, subsequently, the segregation of duties. Having a military background really helps with this line of thinking; however, it does not always translate well into every organization. Saying that, it reiterates my previous statement that flexibility is key.</p>
<p>Frameworks really helped to build the ground roots of my understanding, and each one can be quite different. When starting out, I shot straight for the US <strong>National Institute of Standards and Technology</strong> (<strong>NIST</strong>), and this gave me a broad depth of knowledge that led me to find out about more frameworks to use, which were industry-specific. This included the likes of PCI DSS for all payment card handling, HIPPA for US health care and information handling, and PIPA for the handling of personal information in South Africa. Much like the foundation of a house, a framework can provide you with some of that foundation. However, these are just foundations; certain aspects can differ for various reasons.</p>
<p>The next step is to look to big names in the industry. Bruce Schneier was one of the first that I found that was useful, especially around the topics of cryptography. Then, many others will come to light and you will soon see whose style of writing and insights you enjoy. Try to follow these people on social media and visit their blogs and websites if you have that information. That said, the internet is full of information and helpful sites. Sign up to some threads around your topics of interest to see what's happening around the world. But, beware—you can soon find yourself inundated with information and not know what to read. Stick to reputable sources and keep it relevant to your needs.</p>
<p>Knowing your threat helps you to better focus on what would be required to protect the system. So, in those terms, when I was tasked with looking after certain bits of the business, I would focus all my attention on the means of delivering that software, the hardware it was on, and the methods of accessing it. To better understand the vectors of attacks, I learned to think like an attacker and went and learned about hacking. I achieved a Certified Ethical Hacking (EC-Council, 2019) certificate, and that was my first cybersecurity certification. My next goal was to achieve my CISSP (ISC2, 2019), as this was seen as the flagship certification to have in the industry. This was great to achieve at the time, as I had already had a lot of experience to my name. I also completed my masters degree in computer security just to enhance my educational background. The quest for learning in this field is always vast, and never dull. There is always something to find, even if it means you find out that it's a subject you don't like.</p>
<p>I have used my skills in different organizations and in different roles, each very different and fulfilling. I'm constantly learning and still, to this day, have a passion for the cybersecurity field. I always have a drive to protect the innocent from the dark side of the internet, as many, many people can be naive. Where possible, I like to make my knowledge available to those people, to help them understand the role of cybersecurity. I like talking to parents so that they can protect their children. The World Wide Web is just like the real world and has scary places to visit, and I always like to say that it has made the oldest crimes available in the newest ways; that is, you can rob a bank from the other side of the world without leaving the comfort of an armchair.</p>
<p>In closing, if asked would I do this again, my answer would yes be a thousand times over, as I love it very much. It is a great profession to be in and will be needed as long as the world progresses to move forward, where information will be valuable to someone at some time.</p>

<p>Chief Cybercrime Inspector, Turkish National Police (PhD candidate)</p>
<p><strong>What was your career in before you made the switch to cybersecurity?</strong></p>
<p>My career started in the police, and that's where I am today. Actually, I was assigned to the Cyber Crime Department, because of my academic and personal studies, but that was not my choice.</p>
<p><strong>Tell us about your journey transitioning from your primary career to cybersecurity.</strong></p>
<p>I studied at the Police Academy and Computer Education and Instructional Technologies Department (at Gazi University, Turkey) simultaneously. My career started in the Turkish National Police in the IT Department in 2006. I worked at that department as an office supervisor. My responsibilities were managing all the infrastructure, including Active Directory, the network, the firewall, and so on. I was also attending basic computer skills courses for police officers as an instructor. At that time, I recognized that all kinds of crimes started to contain some kind of IT traction. For a simple example: at that time, bingo was as popular as gambling. It was being played in facilities that were formally operated as entertainment venues. The problem for gamblers was it was very difficult for them to remove all the evidence, because of its heavy weight, in the event of a police raid. After that, they started to use information technology. They were picking numbers using an application running on a remote computer and reflecting them onto a wall. It was easy to remove all of the material that could be called evidence.</p>
<p>The terms <em>pure cyber crime</em> (such as hacking) and <em>cyber-enabled crime</em> (such as online romance) were on the way. The first thing we, as police, are told is that <em>"it is more important to prevent a crime before it happens than investigating after it happens."</em> I recognized that cybersecurity was not just about technical issues; it is inter-disciplinary. Human factors, awareness, economics, and management are all related to it. So, then I got my MSc degree in information systems (at the Middle East Technical University, Turkey). Then, I was assigned to the Cyber Crime section and started to investigate. In 2015, I was assigned to the Cyber Crime Prevention Division at the General Directorate of the Turkish National Police. I started to attend meetings and courses on how to enable cybersecurity. At that time, I got another bachelor's degree at the International Relations Department (at Anadolu University, Turkey), recognizing the importance of establishing good relations internationally for information exchange for cybersecurity. I am a PhD candidate now and about to finish my thesis about cybersecurity awareness. To sum things up, my career is going the same way as it started, but has evolved into cybersecurity over the years.</p>
<p><strong>Why did you choose a career in cybersecurity?</strong></p>
<p>As I mentioned, cybersecurity is an inter-disciplinary area. You should take into consideration many issues while working in it. It also has a parallel evolution with the technology. The rapid development of technology causes changes in cybersecurity. I mean, your knowledge of a topic becomes old very quickly, so you have to read and practice more. It also prevents work from becoming monotonous. I like these types of challenges.</p>
<p><strong>What did you do differently than your peers when choosing cybersecurity as your career?</strong></p>
<p>I did not just focus on technology itself but also security. Security is managed against attacks on different areas of life. The reasons for attacks also differ. Sometimes, targets are governmental systems because of an international contention, sometimes, targets are financial departments because of money, and sometimes, targets are just innocent people, just for <em>"fun."</em> There is no silver bullet for preventing cyber attacks, such as firewalls, password policies, and so on. Hence, I am trying to study all the related topics.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p><strong>What would you like to suggest to our readers who want to start a career in cybersecurity, and how can they do so?</strong></p>
<p>I want to explain this in detail. I have been playing the <strong>baglama</strong> (a Turkish traditional musical instrument that is just like a guitar in appearance) for almost 20 years. My parents bought a baglama for my eldest brother in order for my uncle to teach him how to play it. He was not willing to play the instrument, but I was willing to play it. Then, I started to play it by imitating my uncle's finger movements. I was just following the sequence of finger-presses on the frets. I learned a few songs to play and expanded my repertoire. My desire to play baglama and daily practice made me play it better. But there was a problem. In order to learn a new song, I was dependent on my uncle. Because if I wanted to learn a new song he was playing, I had to imitate his finger movements. After that, I noticed musical notes. A friend of my mother, who is a music teacher, taught me how to read notes and apply them to the baglama. I was no longer dependent on my uncle. I could play new songs by reading notes. After spending more time practicing, I was able to write notes for songs that I heard and played by myself. Years after, I learned the <strong>short-neck baglama</strong>. The one I learned to play was a <strong>long-neck baglama</strong>. A long-neck baglama has 23 frets; on the other hand, a short neck baglama has 19. The chord layout is also different. At first, I thought, <em>I can play every song with my instrument, so why would I need a different one?</em> But after listening to performers using short-neck baglamas, I recognized that it was easier to play a song where I needed to move my fingers very quickly. I changed my mind and bought a short-neck baglama. The notes' positions were different, but it still had the same notes. The mathematics of both instruments was the same. The only thing I had to do was practice. Although it is not easy to play a song for the first time, by applying notes and doing some practice, now I can play baglama professionally. Now, I am almost 35 years old, and I can also play guitar, oud, violin, side-flute, and some percussion instruments. But I am not a professional player. (For the readers who do not believe me, please visit my YouTube channel and don't forget to subscribe and click on the Like button for the videos that you like.)</p>
<p>The period that I spent learning the baglama is almost the same with learning any other topic—and I think all of us have a similar story. There is a similarity between being a good baglama performer and being a good cybersecurity expert. But when they are compared, to be a cybersecurity expert is something like being an orchestra itself. In my opinion (there may be different opinions in literature), a <strong>cybersecurity expert</strong> is a top leader.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>As a simple example: if you examine the job advertisements of big companies, you can see that the job titles are <em>vulnerability researcher, malware analyst, security engineer, penetration tester,</em> and another 30 or so on top. I think these job titles are each like a musical instrument in an orchestra. Working as a cyber-crime investigator and studying cybersecurity for academic purposes, I can determine the necessary topics:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Desire to learn</strong>: A person who wants to work in a cybersecurity field should be a life-long student, even if they have got every certificate in the field. Information technologies are evolving rapidly and knowledge about one technology, which was just learned yesterday, can be old tomorrow. It took almost 38 years for 50 million people to have a radio at home. But it took just 9 months for Facebook to reach 100 million subscribers. According to statistics for the last quarter of 2018, Facebook has 2.32 billion subscribers, and taking into consideration how many times Facebook has changed its user interface and infrastructure, has added new features, and opened new platforms from its establishment, it is easy to see that there is no limit to what we can be faced with and what we should learn about cybersecurity.</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">A person who wants to work in the cybersecurity field should continuously read academic papers, books, and journals that relate to this field; articles on forums and the writings of people who have proved to be good in the field, from their social media accounts and personal web sites (the list can be expanded). This will allow you to both be updated and to be able to search for the correct keywords by becoming familiar with new technical terms and jargon.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Another important topic is to learn <em>why to</em> instead of <em>how to</em>. Anyone can learn how to configure a router by just imitating an administrator. But in the case of an update on a user interface (I am not talking about changing the router itself), you cannot handle <em>how to</em> configure it. You can easily adapt, even if the router has changed, if you learn why the configuration is done that way.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">If you lose your desire to learn and try to learn <em>how to</em> instead of <em>why to,</em> you won't be able to switch from the <em>long-neck baglama</em> to the <em>short-neck baglama</em>. You'll get bored playing the same songs, and in the end find yourself getting cross with the instrument.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>English:</strong> This topic is so clear that it does not need to be explained. While writing these opinions, I searched on Google Scholar using the keyword <kbd>cybersecurity</kbd>. It returned 22,700 results from 2015 to the current date. But when I repeated the search with the same keyword in Turkish, it returned just 323 results within the same time period.
<p>English is just like musical notes that enable you to play any song that you hear. If you do not know how to read notes, you will always be dependent on another who shows you how to play a new song.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Computer sciences</strong>: As I tried to mention, cybersecurity is a top priority and it does not sound proper to me when someone says "<em>I am a cybersecurity expert,"</em> because you cannot be an expert in all sub-fields of cybersecurity. But there will be some topics that a person is very good at and some areas in which the person is not familiar with a sub-field of cybersecurity. My recommendations for beginners would be the following:
<ul>
<li><strong>Data management and file structures:</strong> Whatever sub-field we choose to be an expert at within cybersecurity, we always work with some kind of data. The basic questions that we should be able to answer are how a system defines data, computes it, where and how store to it, find it when needed, and destroy it when it's not needed. We will face all these questions in every sub-field of cybersecurity.</li>
<li><strong>Algorithms and programming:</strong> We can examine this issue from two different perspectives. First, creation: processing and exchanging data becomes possible with an algorithm running through programmed software. The importance of knowledge of algorithms and programming in order to find vulnerabilities in information systems, networks, or software itself is so obvious. Secondly, you will be using some software dedicated to a sub-field of cybersecurity. Sometimes, you will face situations where that software won't be enough or even exist for what you are working on. For example, you might face some cases where you need to visualize data for someone who is not from a technical background, or the software that you are using (nowadays, a lot of software allows you to run your own code with it) doesn't meet your needs completely. Hence, even if it is limited, being able to write your own code takes you one step further.</li>
<li><strong>Data communications and networking:</strong> How does the internet work? What protocols provide security? Understanding networking is a core aspect of cybersecurity. As an example, IoT is very popular and defines a network of devices, such as vehicles and home appliances, which allows these things to connect, interact, and exchange data. If you don't understand the basics of networking, how can you analyze what data is sent from your IoT device? How can you secure the right protocol without knowing how it works? We will also face all these questions in every sub-field of cybersecurity.</li>
<li><strong>Math and Statistics:</strong> You will hear the <em>"computers work with ones and zeros"</em> discourse from anyone who is interested in IT. The way I say this is <em>"like every system in the world, information technologies work with math."</em> You can apply math from four basic operations to integral calculations in cybersecurity. In order to calculate how much MB your <kbd>x</kbd> bit data is, you use four basic operations, and in order to classify your log data, you can use a discriminant function.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="mce-root" style="padding-left: 60px">If you learn the basics of playing, you can be a professional musician. Then, you can also play other instruments or be a part of an orchestra, where you can play in harmony.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hands-on</strong>: It is really hard to learn about any sub-field of cybersecurity without doing hands-on activities. You can find billions of YouTube videos or free PDF books online about the subject. But you should not confine yourself to just watching or reading. You can easily find tools for free or create your own lab for hands-on activities. If you want to learn web programming, then just install a web server, one database, and an editor, and by writing <kbd>&lt;?php</kbd>, take your first step. If you want to learn about networking, then install simulation software and start dragging and dropping computers, routers, and network cables onto the stage. If you want to just calculate how many MB your <kbd>x</kbd> bit data is, then take a paper and a pen and start writing four operations. Don't be afraid.
<p>If you do not take the pick in your hand and strike the strings, you cannot create a sound with a baglama, even if you watch thousands of videos on how to play.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Can you please share your views and thoughts for those who want to be part of the cybersecurity industry?</strong></p>
<p>Actually, I can just share some of my experiences regarding who is working or will work in the cybersecurity industry:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you face a cybersecurity problem, don't always think that it is a technical problem and has a technical solution. Some (maybe many) of these issues are related to human factors. We can examine this issue from two different perspectives:
<ul>
<li>Attackers, who want to access systems without authorization, disrupt or destroy them, try to achieve their goals by using humans, who are the weakest link in the system. Research shows that 90% of cyber attacks start with a fraudulent phishing attempt, because a human firewall has many holes. Human behavior on information systems is affected by age, personality, and so on, and attackers examine these to reach systems. This makes it easier to access systems by using human rather than technical processes, which shows the importance of awareness in cybersecurity.</li>
<li>If there is an error in a system, don't panic, thinking that your system is under attack. I encountered an interruption on a local area network just because of a cleaning staff member seeing a connector lying on the ground (it was connected to a wire to a network face-plate socket on the wall). They unplugged it while cleaning and tried to fix it by plugging it into a free network face-plate socket on the wall, which caused a loop in the network.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Never forget that we who are working in the cybersecurity field need to be one step ahead of attackers. Whatever design you make or policies you apply, thinking that you have taken everything into consideration, you will always miss something out. We will create systems and someone will disrupt it deliberately or accidentally. If systems could process as stably as they were created, then no antivirus software would need any updates.</li>
<li>Days when you face resistance against your security policies will come. For a simple example, you will face a staff member/manager who doesn't want to use a password that must contain at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one digit, one special character, be at least eight characters long, and should be changed every 6 months without matching the previous ones. Sometimes, you will refuse to change the policy but, unfortunately, sometimes you will not. Whatever you do, just document it. Otherwise, when things go bad, the first person who will be accused is you.</li>
</ul>

<p style="color: black">Chief Architect at Enterprise Cyber Solution Architects</p>
<p><strong>What was your career in before making the switch to cybersecurity?</strong><br/></p>
<p style="color: black">Prior to becoming a security architect, I was a technical sales engineer focusing on IT solutions. I was in that field from 1988 to 2000, and it was in that role that I was introduced to IT. My first company decided to start selling network test equipment and I was tasked with understanding the tools. But, without even understanding what a network packet was, that was hard. So, I learned about network protocols and my career in IT took off. I have always been learning about new IT technologies and, as a result, I have always been ahead of the curve.</p>
<p><strong>Tell us about your journey transitioning from your primary career to cybersecurity.</strong><br/></p>
<p style="color: black">I've been in IT since 1988, back when networking was getting started, but long before the internet came about. This was back when a router was used rather than a firewall and firewalls were just specialized routers. My initial introduction to IT security, as it was called then, was when Checkpoint came out with its layer 7 firewall, which introduced the concept of tracking where packet communication originated from.</p>
<p style="color: black">I became a security architect in 2000, when EDS made me its very first security person in Canada. As a result, I've worked on pretty much every major project in Canada, and many in the US.</p>
<p style="color: black"><strong>Why did you choose a career in cybersecurity?</strong><br/></p>
<p style="color: black">Actually, IT security chose me. At the time, I was the senior NOC analyst for EDS supporting BC's Provincial Learning Network (PLNet), the largest public network in North America. But my job description had one phrase that said <em>"...and responsible for security."</em> Well, at the time, EDS had a CEO by the name of Dick Brown who had this habit of sending out emails from various parts of the world saying how well the team in that location was doing.</p>
<p style="color: black">One of our other projects' account managers had approached me about doing a security assessment of their servers, to which I said, <em>"sure."</em> Having never done that before, I looked around EDS's world for the proper way to do security assessments. Around that time, Dick Brown sent one of his emails and I decided to jokingly respond to it. I wrote back, saying <em>"Thanks, Dick, for the email. By the way, where can I find out how to do security assessments?"</em> I didn't expect any response, but life surprises you. Dick forwarded my email to the VP who had just set up the IT Security team in Hearndon, Virginia, to support the NSA, CIA, and another three initialism organizations of the US government. That VP flew up to Vancouver to meet with me and, surprise surprise, I became EDS's very first security person in Canada (even before there was executive support for that).</p>
<p style="color: black"><strong>What did you do differently than your peers when choosing cybersecurity as your career?</strong><br/></p>
<p style="color: black">Becoming the very first security person in Canada for EDS meant that I was put onto every major project that EDS had. I did the security for the Bank of Canada's bond-selling outsourcing project. I secured the ScotiaBank's HR outsourcing project. I designed the security for the city of Calgary's web portal, back when web portals were just taking off. So, what did I do differently than my peers? Well, everything.</p>
<p style="color: black">I was involved in the implementation of the first Federation solution at GM. I was the security architect for the Vancouver Winter Olympics. I've worked on security for the Smart Meter infrastructure for BC and worked with NIST's NCCoE creating reference architectures for the utility space. In short, I've been where very few security architects have gone.</p>
<p style="color: black">And I've done this by focusing on the architecture component of security architecture. The vast majority of security architects are security people who deal with architectures. I am an architect who specializes in security. As a result, I'm a lot more versatile than most.</p>
<p><strong>Can you please share your views and thoughts for those who want to be part of the cybersecurity industry?</strong><br/></p>
<p style="color: black">Well, basically, I believe that security people now have forgotten why they are in existence. They believe they are gate keepers of the organization they work for and, as a result, put up roadblocks to most projects. They have forgotten that they are <em>not</em> the core business of the organization and, as a result, will often be viewed as people to be avoided, if at all possible. They tell people why they <em>can't</em> do something rather than giving them solutions so that they can move forward.</p>
<p style="color: black">If you want to go into cybersecurity, keep in mind that, while you may find issues with what someone is doing, it's far better to provide a proper course of action than to simply just say <em>"no."</em></p>
<p><strong>In your opinion, how is your old career helping you or influencing you on your cybersecurity journey?</strong><br/></p>
<p style="color: black">I have trained numerous security architects through the years and I have found, without fail, that the best architects (regardless of what domain they are in) come from the sales side of things. This is simply because they know to ask questions before proposing solutions. People that come from the technology side of things tend to jump to solutions before asking questions and understanding requirements. So, from my old career, I thank the fact that I learned how to ask questions.</p>
<p><strong>What would you like to suggest to our readers who want to start a career in cybersecurity, and how can they do so?</strong><br/></p>
<p style="color: black">My biggest suggestion is to find out more about what is going on before jumping to conclusions or solutions. I remember the first time I was working in an operations center and I saw what I thought was some sort of hacking attempt. I was excited and jumped to all sorts of conclusions, none of which turned out to be real. Take your time to understand what is going on and don't let your emotions run away with you.</p>
<p><strong>Do you suggest that someone should be an expert in one vertical of cybersecurity, or should they be an expert every area of cybersecurity? What is your opinion from an industry perspective?</strong><br/></p>
<p style="color: black">Going vertical or going horizontal all depends on what you want to do with your career. Remember that the further up you go, the more your expertise becomes a combination of business and technology. The higher you go, the more you focus on the business aspects and the less you focus on technology. If you want to become an expert in one specific area, that's fine. Just keep in mind where you want to end up.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p style="color: black">Oh, and that doesn't mean that you have to try and move up the corporate ladder. I have a friend who I worked with originally at EDS, and he taught me that not everyone wants to move up the ladder. I could never do what he loved to do, which was Level 1 Help Desk. But that's what was right for him. Understand what you want to do and what you enjoy and go from there. Don't assume that what you want is the same as what others want.</p>
<p><strong>The cybersecurity landscape is ever-changing and is extremely dynamic; how do you keep yourself updated? What are your suggestions for our readers?</strong><br/></p>
<p style="color: black">The nature of what I do has evolved over time simply because the nature of security has changed. Originally, it was called IT security, then it became information security; now, everyone calls it cybersecurity, and that is simply because the breadth of security has changed as technology has expanded.</p>
<p style="color: black">What I have learned is that you don't focus on the technologies. Technologies constantly change, and no one will always be an expert in every technological area. But if you see patterns of how to do your job, document them and then follow them. For example, the process of creating a design is the same, regardless of the technologies involved. So, try to get really good at following the processes you have. Remember, every solution is a combination of <strong>people</strong>, <strong>process</strong>, <em>and</em> <strong>technology</strong>—not technology alone. If you remember that, it becomes easier.</p>
<p><strong>In your view, what is more important: having a security certification, getting relevant security training, or gaining hands-on experience through a job?</strong><br/></p>
<p style="color: black">That's a chicken-and-egg question. When you first get into the field, every HR person is asking for your certifications. But after a few years, your resumé will speak louder than any certification you could have. You need certifications when you first go into a field, but then it's the experience that you pick up that moves you forward.</p>
<p style="color: black">When I first got into security, back in 2000, I got my CISSP (I was something like 2,410, which tells you how few of us there were). I then got my CCNA (Cisco), CNA (Novell), MCSE, and CCSA (Checkpoint). But I let them elapse by 2005, simply because my resumé was so much better. I haven't had a certification since then. But I wouldn't have gotten started without them.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p><strong>We all agree that cybersecurity is a non-negotiable factor of today's industry. As an industry leader, in your opinion, what are those new frontiers where cybersecurity will be needed in the near future?</strong><br/></p>
<p style="color: black">I think that there are technologies out there that presently do not have network connectivity, but that will have. We commonly call that the IoT. As technologies become more and more connected, you will see more and more need for cybersecurity. But that's only part of the story.</p>
<p style="color: black">Remember, every solution has three components (people, process, technologies). To just talk about technological changes is to miss the vast majority of changes coming. Every role will start to have cybersecurity built into them. Remember, security isn't the responsibility of any one person or team. It's the responsibility of all individuals. Making sure individuals understand security is going to grow in leaps and bounds.</p>
<p style="color: black">From the process side of things, there's a real need to ensure that security is integrated into <em>all</em> processes in such a way that processes speed up, while at the same time ensuring that security becomes integrated into the way we do things. So, the audit and the operations side of cybersecurity will grow.</p>
<p style="color: black">But one area that people forget is <strong>governance</strong>. I believe that there is a fourth component to all solutions, and that is governance. And I believe that the time will come when products that are networked will have to meet some sort of industry standard. Not ISO 27001, but something different (maybe ISA99—who knows?). But if you look at anything electrical, it has to meet CSA and UL standards of safety. I think the same thing will occur with cybersecurity.</p>
<p style="color: black"><strong>Who is Neil Rerup?</strong><br/></p>
<p style="color: black">I lead an architecture firm that provides architectural services (enterprise and solution) to enterprises across North America. I, personally, am an enterprise architect who came out of the world of cybersecurity. I have worked on a number of projects for enterprises around the world and have worked in various architecture domains, including security, networking, and applications.</p>
<p style="color: black">My clients have been in various market segments, including, but not limited to, utilities, government, finance, forestry, automotive, special events, and retail. I've acted as an enterprise architect (providing strategy creation services and architecture leadership) to solution architects (creating solutions and performing architecture assessments).</p>

<p style="color: black">Director, SAP</p>
<p style="color: black"><strong>What was your career in before making a switch to cybersecurity?</strong></p>
<p style="color: black">My first job out of university was as a network engineer setting up switches and routers for customers. The company I was working for back then was also selling Checkpoint firewalls, and I was soon drawn into the security world! So, in reality, I was fortunate enough to start in cybersecurity in 2000, long before it was called cybersecurity!</p>
<p style="color: black"><strong>Why did you choose a career in cybersecurity?</strong><br/></p>
<p style="color: black">Cybersecurity is fascinating; it is like being on the superheroes team fighting the villains! It is continuously changing and never, ever boring. It sits horizontally across IT and recently it is discussed at board level and by CxOs across the globe. If you are someone who likes to learn and develop, then the cybersecurity field is definitely one to consider.</p>
<p style="color: black"><strong>What you did differently than your peers when choosing cybersecurity as your career?</strong><br/></p>
<p style="color: black">I started off briefly in the networking field and built a strong foundation in routing and switching, which really helps when you transition into a security technical role, as it provides you with a strong foundation that will make it easier to understand the different cybersecurity solutions and better troubleshoot any issues. I also sought to get certified in my first few years. I focused on the Cisco and Checkpoint certifications from a technical point of view and on the CISSP to provide me with knowledge so that I could have better discussions with CISOs. In 2003, I was one of the first CISSPs in my region, and this really provided me with a strong boost to my career. Of course, it's not all about the certifications and knowledge. You need to augment it with hands-on experience and practice. As I was working for a systems integrator, I was installing and configuring firewalls and other security solutions day in and day out.</p>
<p style="color: black">There was a lot of self-learning. I remember spending sleepless nights reading up on Linux and Solaris as I had to configure servers and harden them to install the Checkpoint firewall. I invested a lot of time and effort in my learning and certification. Till this day, I love learning new stuff and since I am no longer in a technical role, I am now in sales. I love sitting down with smart technical people and having a discussion with them, asking them to break down certain concepts to a level where someone such as me can understand—cybersecurity for dummies.</p>
<p style="color: black"><strong>Can you please share your views and thoughts for those who want to be part of the cybersecurity industry?</strong><br/></p>
<p style="color: black">If you are reading this, then you are probably interested in cybersecurity. It is a fascinating field and yet so mysterious. Tell anyone that you are working in cybersecurity and their eyes will light up and they will start asking you <em>is it true ...</em> questions, such as "<em>Is it true our phone manufacturer can spy on us via our camera?</em>" or "<em>Can a hacker hack my Facebook password in seconds</em>," and so on. No matter who you are talking to, they will be interested in listening to what you have to say. As a career, it is one that will always have you coming back for more. I have been in the cybersecurity field for 19 years, on and off, and I still enjoy every bit of it. The conversations I have had have really changed over the years, from protecting your organizations, the perimeter, to protecting users and data and mobile devices—and it doesn't stop there. You will definitely not have a single boring day if you choose to pursue a career in cybersecurity.</p>
<p style="color: black"><strong>In your opinion, how is your old career helping you or influencing you on your cybersecurity journey?</strong><br/></p>
<p style="color: black">I started out my career in networking, quickly moved into cybersecurity, and spent 6 years in a cybersecurity-focused role. I then moved into a sales role with less focus on cybersecurity. I then moved back into a cybersecurity-focused sales role after an 8-year gap. However, throughout those 8 years, I was always passionate about cybersecurity, and even when working for Cisco and Google, I always identified solutions that related to cybersecurity and led discussions with customers on those solutions. I had the knowledge and experience in this field, and this provided me with a lot of credibility and trust with customers, even though I was a sales guy! The 8 years outside of cybersecurity helped me to better appreciate security, since even when I was selling cloud applications at Google, guess what the first question would be? "<em>Is the cloud secure?</em>". When I would try to sell a large end-to-end network at Cisco, one of the top questions would be "<em>How do we secure</em> <em>it?</em>". So, no matter what role we play in the IT world, cybersecurity is going to be left, right, and center. My foray into the non-cybersecurity world made me appreciate cybersecurity even more and get a better idea of what customers have in mind when they say security. For some it is privacy, for others it is information security and governance, and for others it is even physical security, as in bodyguards and CCTV!</p>
<p style="color: black"><strong>What would you like to suggest to our readers who want to start a career in cybersecurity, and how can they do so?</strong></p>
<p style="color: black">These days, you are fortunate to have a lot of resources, courses, and official university courses on cybersecurity. So, it all depends on which level of your career you are at and what you want to do in the future. You need to decide whether you want to be technical, pre-sales, governance, or maybe even sell cybersecurity (as I do). And then you can delve deeper into each area. The CISSP is still a great certification, I hear, and there are definitely a lot of other certifications out there. Find one that makes sense for you and pursue it.</p>
<p style="color: black"><strong>Do you suggest that someone should be an expert in one vertical of cybersecurity, or should they be an expert in every area of cybersecurity? What is your opinion from an industry perspective?</strong><br/></p>
<p style="color: black">The jack-of-all-trades and master of none! That is never a good thing, unless you are just a hobbyist. If you want to build a career out of anything, you need to focus. Cybersecurity is definitely a very wide domain these days. I would strongly urge you to get a holistic understanding, not very deep, across the domains and then choose one area to focus on and go deep into that area. The area you choose might be related to the solutions you are working on now, or that you want to work on in the future. But you can never learn one area in isolation. If you want to focus on IoT cybersecurity, as an example, you cannot just learn IoT cybersecurity and that's it. You will need to understand a lot about cybersecurity at a high level, and in some areas even at a deeper level, before tackling IoT. And the beauty with learning is that you don't have to stop there—you can learn more and learn different things. So, after a few years in IoT cybersecurity, you might decide that you want to do ethical hacking for the next few years. Put your learning hat on, leverage everything you have learned so far, and build on top of it.</p>
<p style="color: black"><strong>The cybersecurity landscape is ever-changing and extremely dynamic; how do you keep yourself updated? What are your suggestions for our readers?</strong><br/></p>
<p style="color: black">If you have been reading my answers so far, you will have noticed that I am all about learning. Keeping yourself up to date is just another way of learning. And luckily, today, regardless of how you like to consume knowledge regarding cybersecurity, there are endless resources out there, from websites to podcasts, videos, and tons of contents from cybersecurity vendors such as the <em>Cybersecurity for Dummies</em> free PDF from Palo Alto Networks. You can subscribe to newsletters, read websites such as <a href="http://darkreading.com/">darkreading.com</a>, and listen to a podcast on your way to work. Another favorite method of learning for myself is to talk to my colleagues and friends in the cybersecurity world and ask them what's the latest, what they are working on, and so forth. You learn so much from speaking to other people.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p style="color: black">I also do the same with my customers; they are out there talking to dozens of vendors every day, so I am always curious to know what the latest trends are from them and then go back and research them online. Attending conferences and trade shows can be valuable as well, as long as you take the time to talk with people and understand what they are doing and why their solutions are important. <strong>Always Be Curious</strong> (<strong>ABC</strong>), whether that translates into reading more or asking people around you more.</p>
<p style="color: black"><strong>In your view, what is more important: having a security certification, getting the relevant security training, or gaining hands-on experience through a job?</strong><br/></p>
<p style="color: black">Honestly, all three! We have a lot more time on our hands, even if we are busy, to fit in all three. Security certification is like a course: you go through it for a period of time and then get certified. So, it will keep you busy for days, weeks, or months, but then it is over and it will have been time and effort well spent. In terms of security training, those are usually very expensive, so if you get a chance to attend one sponsored by your company, make sure you do. Even if you believe you won't learn a lot of new things, you only need to learn a few new things. If you come out knowing 10 percent more than you did before attending the course, that is amazing! 10 percent more in 4-5 days! However, if you are technical or training to be in the technical field of cybersecurity, then nothing beats hands-on experience at work. Offer your services for free if you are a student, just so you can learn. When I was at university—a long time ago—I worked for free at a computer shop, just to learn how to take PCs apart and put them together, and then set them up again. I learned more in the first few weeks on the job than all the reading I had done in the past 5 years!</p>
<p style="color: black"><strong>We all agree that cybersecurity is a non-negotiable factor of today's industry. As an industry leader, in your opinion, what are those new frontiers where cybersecurity will be needed in the coming future?</strong><br/></p>
<p style="color: black">Cybersecurity is already embedded in everything we do as people and as organizations. Whether you are using Face ID to unlock your phone or sending an email to your manager, several layers of cybersecurity are at play to make sure each interaction is secure. As we all know, devices are all getting connected to the internet, and devices are already talking to one another and to us humans. Every aspect of our lives is being automated or turned into an on-demand service, whether it is catching an Uber to work, getting your car refueled, watching a TV show, or walking into your house. All these services will need to be secured, and attackers will always try to illegally access those services, devices, and information. Our children need to be educated about cybersecurity, and so do our parents and grandparents.</p>
<p style="color: black">Cybersecurity is going to go hand in hand with any future technology, whether it is quantum computing, VR, or flying to the moon. So, there are no limits to where cybersecurity is going, but I can guarantee you this: if you pursue a career in cybersecurity, you will definitely have a lot of fun, and your skills will always be in demand, even if AI tries to take over the world, as we will need cybersecurity experts to protect us from the AI!</p>

<p style="color: black">Executive Director IT and IS</p>
<p><strong>What was your career in before you made the switch to cybersecurity?</strong></p>
<p>I was heading an IT project in the Indian Navy before I switched over to cybersecurity.</p>
<p><strong>Tell us about your journey transitioning from your primary career to cybersecurity.</strong><br/></p>
<p style="color: black">While launching an application over a naval network in the Eastern Naval Command, the challenge was to protect information from unauthorized access. Knowing full well the implications of any loopholes, I decided to first educate and test the network myself before even seeking any external help. So, I learned ethical hacking and got myself certified by the EC Council. Then, I trained my team and secured the network before launching the application. I found the career to be very challenging, demanding, and fulfilling. As I was one of very few certified ethical hackers, I got support from my command to carry out security audits of many units. This gave me a solid foundation for my career in cybersecurity in the corporate world after my naval service.</p>
<p><strong>Why did you choose a career in cybersecurity?</strong><br/></p>
<p style="color: black">It was a transition phase from a manual to an automated work culture. The pace of digitization was picking up, and many channels of communication were opening. The security of data and communication was the prime challenge in the success of these products. I found the field of cybersecurity to be very demanding and fulfilling.</p>
<p><strong>What did you do differently than your peers when choosing cybersecurity as your career?</strong><br/></p>
<p style="color: black">Before taking help from any external vendors in securing my application and network, I thought of educating myself fully on risk and mitigation control. This gave me a complete understanding of the challenges and helped me get the most from the external vendors and experts. I volunteered for many initiatives that were required for a secure network. In this regard, my paper on indigenous firewalls was well appreciated by DRDO. The completion of this project under my guidance and appreciation by DRDO brought me to the limelight and gave me many opportunities to excel in my career in cybersecurity.</p>
<p><strong>Share your views and thoughts for those who want to be part of the cybersecurity industry.</strong><br/></p>
<p style="color: black">With the quick pace of digitization and the proportional threat of data theft or disruption, the cybersecurity industry is getting more traction than any other industry. Whereas security expenses used to be considered an avoidable cost, it has now become an essential element in any initiatives on digitization. Hence, there has been a paradigm shift toward the cybersecurity industry.</p>
<p><strong>In your opinion, how is your old career helping you or influencing you on your cybersecurity journey?</strong><br/></p>
<p style="color: black">For any career journey to be successful, basic knowledge and hands-on practice of the underlying technology is an essential ingredient. My old career gave me the opportunity to build up this foundation.</p>
<p><strong>What would you like to suggest to our readers who want to start a career in cybersecurity, and how can they do so?</strong><br/></p>
<p style="color: black">Thinking about cybersecurity is the first step. Then, in whatever way they are part of the digitization process, they should understand the underlying technology and the possible vulnerabilities. The gate to the next step will automatically be open.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p><strong>Do you suggest that someone should be an expert in one vertical of cybersecurity, or should they be an expert in every area of cybersecurity? What is your opinion from an industry perspective?</strong><br/></p>
<p style="color: black">After obtaining an understanding and expertise on network and endpoint security, they should look for vertical experience in one particular area, such as IoT, cloud security, or application security, and so on. From a job perspective, this would be preferred.</p>
<p><strong>The cybersecurity landscape is ever-changing and extremely dynamic; how do you keep yourself updated? What are your suggestions for our readers?</strong></p>
<p style="color: black">There are many ways to remain updated. I am part of many groups and forums that are active on issues related to cybersecurity. I speak at these forums and listen to other experts. Speaking at such forums of experts and enthusiasts gives me the energy to learn more on the topic. Listening to experts provokes a thought process to learn more. Discussion groups are a good source of the latest information related to cybersecurity.</p>
<p style="color: black">You should join or form such interest groups and start attending seminars on cybersecurity to remain updated.</p>
<p><strong>In your view, what is more important: having a security certification, getting relevant security training, or gaining hands-on experience through a job?</strong><br/></p>
<p style="color: black">Certification gives you the credentials for a job, whereas training and hands-on experience boost self-confidence. Hence, both are important for a career in cybersecurity.</p>
<p><strong>We all agree that cybersecurity is a non-negotiable factor of today's industry. As an industry leader, in your opinion, what are those new frontiers where cybersecurity will be needed in the near future?</strong><br/></p>
<p style="color: black">Cybersecurity is now part of everyday life and hence no frontier is left out. Because of the rapid automation of every aspect of life, be it in the health industry, transportation, or general governance, there will be an exponential increase in connected devices. The security of these devices is becoming one of the greatest challenges in the area of cybersecurity.</p>

<p>Threat Intelligence Analyst, FireEye, Inc.</p>
<p style="color: black"><strong>Why did you choose to move into the cybersecurity industry?</strong></p>
<p style="color: black">After graduating from CSU with a grad certificate in criminal intelligence, I landed a role as an intelligence analyst in the Child Exploitation Internet Unit of the NSW police force. I became fascinated by the cat-and-mouse game that played out between the technical strategies of offenders and the police. This is very similar to the dynamic between hackers and those seeking to protect computing assets. Additionally, the intelligence cycle itself is similar to the reconnaissance phase of a cyber attack. Shortly after leaving this role, I commenced my master's in information systems security (MISS) at CSU.</p>
<p style="color: black"><strong>What did you do before moving into cybersecurity?</strong></p>
<p style="color: black">After working for the NSW police force as an intelligence analyst, I commenced a role as a content analyst at the Office of the eSafety Commissioner, which involved a take-down of child sexual abuse material online. This required tracing content to the hosting servers, and inspecting content for digital artifacts that could be used by police to protect victims and catch offenders. It was during this role that I commenced and completed my MISS.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p style="color: black"><strong>What process (including a timeline) did you use to move into cybersecurity?</strong></p>
<p style="color: black">Before commencing the MISS, I completed the grad certificate in criminal intelligence at CSU in 2008, and in 2013 completed a Dip of Public Safety (Police Intelligence Practice). This study prepared me for the rigors of studying the MISS by distance, which I commenced in 2013.</p>
<p style="color: black">It took me around 5 years to complete my MISS while working full-time. It took so long because I only undertook one subject per session, and also took a one-session break away from the course. This slow pace was necessary for me, as I did not come from a technical background, and so I did a lot more reading and preparation for each assessment task, which took considerable time. The session off from study was necessary to avoid burn-out. As a conclusion of my study, I began applying for entry-level roles in cybersecurity. I was extremely fortunate to have the assistance of IT masters at CSU, who announced my success at winning the MISS award for the highest graduating grade point average, to a wide pool of potential employers. It was only a matter of weeks after this email announcement that I received a number of invitations to interview. Shortly after, I accepted a position as a security consultant doing penetration tests.</p>
<p style="color: black"><strong>What helped your move?</strong></p>
<p style="color: black">Performing well on my master's course was critical in securing a role. Additionally, being able to demonstrate an employment background in an analytical discipline also helped me past my lack of experience in technical roles. My strong academic background helped me perform well in the MISS, so my prior studies were also very important.</p>
<p style="color: black"><strong>What hindered your move?</strong></p>
<p style="color: black">My biggest barriers to moving into a cybersecurity role were a lack of a computing undergraduate degree, and experience in technical roles. Every employer seems to want security experience, or IT experience at the very least.</p>
<p style="color: black">The challenges of completing a master's level study in an unfamiliar field were also considerable. Studying by distance mode while working full-time in an unrelated field was very taxing. The first time I met one of my fellow students was at graduation. I never even met another student on the same course of study at exam time. This meant that I had no fellow students to bounce ideas off. Not working in IT also meant I had no one at work to seek guidance from.</p>
<p style="color: black"><strong>Can you describe your current role?</strong></p>
<p style="color: black">I am currently employed as a cyber threat analyst for a multinational security company. In this role, I provide analysis to public and private sector clients regarding the threats posed by various threat actors. I provide intelligence on the <strong>Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures</strong> (<strong>TTP</strong>), targeting patterns, favored malware, and so on, of different threat actors to drive clients to direct resources in order to combat the most likely sources and forms of attack. I am able to either work from home or the office.</p>
<p style="color: black"><strong>With the benefit of hindsight, are you happy that you decided to move into the cybersecurity industry?</strong></p>
<p style="color: black">Since moving into the cybersecurity industry, I have never looked back. Being a growing industry, my opportunities are only likely to increase, and I'm not likely to be ever out of a job unless I choose to be. I am now able to work from home and take my children to and from school. I have never had more flexibility. I also have the opportunity to work in other countries if I so choose. The only thing that troubles me is the lack of gender diversity in the industry. Universities and employers need to become more creative to incentivize women to consider a career in the industry.</p>
<p style="color: black"><strong>Do you suggest that someone should be an expert in one vertical of cybersecurity, or should they try to an be expert in every area of cybersecurity?</strong></p>
<p style="color: black">Although I'm still very new to the industry, I don't believe it's possible to be an expert in all domains of cybersecurity. You can become an expert of one or two domains, or even three (if you have no life), but I don't believe there is necessarily an employer demand for having knowledge of all domains. Roles are increasingly specialized, due to the time it requires to accumulate the skills and knowledge to even become proficient in a role, let alone master it.</p>
<p style="color: black"><strong>In your view, what is more important: having a security certification, getting the relevant security training, or gaining hands-on experience through a job?</strong></p>
<p style="color: black">Employers seem to look for certifications that require a practical component. Multiple-choice certifications are often ridiculed, and I have found that it can be better to list no certifications than include these type of certifications on a resumé. Hands-on skills are highly valued, and should be acquired in any method possible. Universities could do a lot more to incorporate practical assessment tasks in their subjects, and market this to employer groups. I have known employers to favor a prospective employee's blog that demonstrates their hands-on skills over qualifications. They want to know that you can demonstrate the skills, not describe principles (unless you want to work in sales).</p>
<p style="color: black"><strong>Is it feasible for students to move into the cybersecurity industry if they don't have experience working as a sysadmin or in a network support role?</strong></p>
<p style="color: black">It is feasible, but only for the exceptionally motivated. If you live by the mantra that <em>"P's get degrees,"</em> and have no sysadmin or network support experience, expect to be disappointed. I demonstrated with no sysadmin or network support experience that you can still master a body of knowledge with a lot of hard work. Also, demonstrating good writing skills in assessments is also important. I was actually requested to provide a sample assessment from my MISS in light of my lack of work experience. In my experience, short of having work experience, demonstrating the ability to acquire the knowledge through studies is the next best thing.</p>
<p style="color: black"><strong>Who is Will Keppel?</strong></p>

<p style="color: black">CEO of IT Masters, Lecturer at Charles Sturt University</p>
<p style="color: black"><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p style="color: black">In 2002, Microsoft and Martin Hale from the industry-based education company IT Masters approached <strong>Charles Sturt University</strong> (<strong>CSU</strong>) with the concept of building an industry-relevant master's degree. The target audience for the proposed master's was industry professionals who would study the degree online while working full-time, and the latest industry certifications would be an integral part of the master's.</p>
<p style="color: black">The Master of Networking and Systems Administration was introduced in 2003 and the first of two cybersecurity masters' in 2006. In 2007, CSU became Australia's largest provider of master's degrees to Aussie IT Pros, and the latest enrollment figures show that the CSU has 115 percent more enrollments than the next largest university.</p>

<p class="mce-root"/>
<p style="color: black"><strong>Getting a job in the cybersecurity industry</strong></p>
<p style="color: black">Up until approximately 5 years ago, I would have included <strong>Cybersecurity Specialist</strong> (<strong>CSS</strong>) in the same category as other specialist IT roles, such as information architect, or data architect and my advice to inexperienced applicants would basically have been "<em>good luck."</em> This is because employers would only consider experienced applicants for these roles, and the pool of potential positions was small.</p>
<p style="color: black">However, the last 5 years has seen an explosion in CSS roles, which has meant that experienced people are either no longer available or leaving because they are being poached by other companies. This shortage has forced the employment of inexperienced and partially qualified applicants.</p>
<p style="color: black"><strong>Process and timeline for getting a job in the cybersecurity industry</strong></p>
<p style="color: black">The first thing to understand is that CSS roles are high-end roles dealing with extremely complicated combinations of platforms, technologies, and threat landscapes. Even if CSS roles were not complicated, a mistake by a CSS has the potential to literally bring down a company, so employers will definitely only consider applicants with the right background and underpinning knowledge. The key underpinning knowledge is an understanding of how computer networks are structured, so my timeline for those wanting to get a job in the cybersecurity industry would be as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Now:</strong> Get a job in IT support. L1 IT support roles are a great learning platform for not just the technology but also dealing with users and management. L1 support positions are also the main pathway into the rest of the IT industry and because they have high turnover rates, there are lots of entry-level positions available.</li>
<li><strong>In 12 months' time:</strong> Get promoted into a network support, sysadmins position. Concentrate on positions with SMEs, because they are normally more diverse than large IT support shops, allowing you to learn and broaden your horizons and also give exposure to security. If you are going to a large IT section, make sure there is the opportunity to get widespread exposure and not be stuck supporting only a narrow subset of technologies.</li>
<li><strong>In 18 months' time:</strong> Start a comprehensive education or development program that covers all the major facets of cybersecurity. As pointed out earlier, CSS roles are inherently complicated, and you need to make sure that your program covers all the eight domains defined by the leading cybersecurity industry body—the <strong>International Information System Security Certification Consortium</strong> (<strong>ISC2</strong>):
<ul>
<li>Security and Risk Management</li>
<li>Asset Security</li>
<li>Security Engineering</li>
<li>Communications and Network Security</li>
<li>Identity and Access Management</li>
<li>Security Assessment and Testing</li>
<li>Security Operations</li>
<li>Software Development Security</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="color: black;padding-left: 60px"><strong>What should I look for when selecting a cybersecurity education program?</strong></p>
<p style="color: black;padding-left: 60px">Your choice of education program is extremely important. Some of the factors you should research before making your choice are as follows:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: none">
<li style="list-style-type: none">
<ul>
<li><strong>How much is on topic?</strong> Employers are only going to be interested in what is relevant to the CSS, so make sure that most of the program you select is focused on cybersecurity</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>How current is the content?</strong> The cybersecurity industry is evolving rapidly, and it is critical that the very latest developments are incorporated into the program</li>
<li><strong>Does it include prep for cybersecurity industry certification?</strong> This is not essential, but you can differentiate your resumé by adding less complex industry certifications, such as CompTIA's Security+ and EC Council's Certified Ethical Hacker</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="color: black;padding-left: 60px"><em>Attachment A</em> describes how well Charles Sturt Universities' Master of Cybersecurity meets the preceding criteria.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>In 24 months' time:</strong> Start applying for cybersecurity roles 6 months after you commence your development program. Because of the chronic skills shortage, we have seen numerous examples where students have been employed while only part way through their degree.</li>

<p style="color: black"><strong>Studying Cybersecurity at Charles Sturt University, Australia</strong></p>
<p style="color: black"><strong>Who can pursue a career in cybersecurity?</strong></p>
<p style="color: black">Over the last couple of years, we have seen students from a wide range of backgrounds successfully transition into the cybersecurity industry. The one common thread with almost all of these students is that they have had a long-term "<em>interest in"</em> or "<em>passion for"</em> computing networking and security.</p>
<p style="color: black"><strong>Is there an age limit to changing from a primary career to cybersecurity?</strong></p>
<p style="color: black">We have had students from their early 20s up to 50 years old.</p>
<p style="color: black"><strong>Why should cybersecurity be chosen as a career?</strong></p>
<p style="color: black">The obvious answers are the wages and job security, but I think it would be a fascinating career because every day would throw up new challenges. The growing importance would mean that you have the opportunity to work with senior management.</p>
<p style="color: black"><strong>What is ITM/CSU offering in cyberspace, and do you help your students find jobs?</strong></p>
<p style="color: black">We offer two master's degrees: a Master of Cybersecurity (<a href="https://futurestudents.csu.edu.au/courses/police-security-emergency/master-cyber-security">https://futurestudents.csu.edu.au/courses/police-security-emergency/master-cyber-security</a>) and a Master of Information Systems Security (<a href="https://futurestudents.csu.edu.au/courses/technology-computing-maths/master-information-systems-security">https://futurestudents.csu.edu.au/courses/technology-computing-maths/master-information-systems-security</a>).</p>
<p style="color: black">The Master of Cybersecurity is designed for cybersecurity specialists, while the Master of Information Systems Security is designed for generalists with security as part of their job (for example, system administrator, IT manager, and so on).</p>
<p style="color: black">However, our customers would not be impressed if we facilitated the poaching of their staff, so this service is restricted to students who are not already employed in the cybersecurity industry.</p>
<p style="color: black"><strong>Share your views and thoughts for those who want to be part of the cybersecurity industry.</strong></p>
<p style="color: black">It's a fascinating industry that is on the cusp of becoming one of the major sectors in the IT industry. The growing sophistication of attacks and the devastating impact they can have on any company will mean that the CSS will become among the most important/valued employees in any company.</p>
<p style="color: black"><strong>How is ITM CSU influencing a cybersecurity journey for their students?</strong></p>
<p style="color: black"><strong>Charles Sturt University</strong> (<strong>CSU</strong>) has (easily) the largest number of IT enrolments of any university in Australia, and cybersecurity is by far our largest IT research area. All of the students studying our Doctor of IT are studying applied research that is designed to make contributions to the international knowledge base.</p>
<p style="color: black"><strong>What would you like to suggest to our readers who want to start a career in cybersecurity, and how can they do so?</strong></p>
<p style="color: black">See my recommendation pathway at the beginning of this document.</p>
<p style="color: black"><strong>Do you suggest that someone should be an expert in one vertical of cybersecurity, or should they be an expert in every area of cybersecurity? What is your opinion from an industry perspective?</strong></p>
<p style="color: black">Students should definitely concentrate on a vertical because cybersecurity is far too wide for them to become an expert in every vertical. However, they should set up a development pathway that exposes them to all of the verticals so that they can work effectively and also have the option of moving between verticals.</p>
<p style="color: black"><strong>The cybersecurity landscape is ever-changing and extremely dynamic, so how do you keep students updated? What are your suggestions for our readers?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Obtain industry certifications such as CISSP, CEH, and Security+, and then update them as they get out of date</li>
<li>Engage with cybersecurity industry associations</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>In your view, what is more important: having a security certification, getting relevant security training, or gaining hands-on experience through a job?</strong></p>
<p style="color: black">Nothing beats the learning gained from hands-on experience in the field. However, if experience in the field is not available, the next best option is a comprehensive education program that incorporates hands-on practice.</p>
<p style="color: black"><strong>We all agree with the fact that cybersecurity is a non-negotiable factor of today's industry. As an industry leader, in your opinion, what are those new frontiers where cybersecurity will be needed in the near future?</strong></p>
<p style="color: black">I don't think I am qualified to answer that.</p>
<p style="color: black"><strong>My work schedule is extremely busy; I cannot attend classes physically. Do you have a solution for that?</strong></p>
<p style="color: black">Both master's are only available online, and all of the students that are currently enrolled are studying part-time while working full-time.</p>
<p style="color: black"><strong>How much does a master's course cost, for Australians and for international students? Are there any free courses?</strong></p>
<p style="color: black">The cost is AUD 3,250 per subject for domestic students and AUD 3,350 per subject for overseas students. Depending on how much credit you qualify for (<a href="https://www.itmasters.edu.au/am-i-eligible/">https://www.itmasters.edu.au/am-i-eligible/</a>), there are up to 12 subjects.</p>
<p style="color: black">We have 10 free cybersecurity online courses (<a href="https://www.itmasters.edu.au/about-it-masters/free-short-courses/">https://www.itmasters.edu.au/about-it-masters/free-short-courses/</a>) that cover the first 4 weeks of one of our subjects. Passing exams in the course will qualify you for a certificate, and passing 3 exams will qualify you for credit into our Master of Cybersecurity degree.</p>

<p style="color: black"><strong>How can someone become a good information security professional?</strong></p>
<p style="color: black">Nowadays, organizations are looking for good security professionals, especially with the aggressive move to cloud technologies and full dependency on technology in all work aspects.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p style="color: black">Based on my experience, I would highly recommend anyone joining information security to have the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Solid basic knowledge</strong>: Always remember that knowledge is power. Solid basic knowledge is a must. Networking skills are essential for any information security professional. This knowledge includes TCP/IP, subnets, DNS, DHCP, routers, switches, and other networking general concepts. Completing the CompTIA Network+ and CompTIA Security+ certification and then moving to the CISCO CCNA Certification (CISCO Certified Network Associate) or equivalent knowledge is very highly recommended.</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">The next step would be learning basic web security and penetration testing techniques and life cycles, which gives added value. I would recommend at this stage something such as eLearnsecurity JPT (Junior Penetration Testing). This is an online certification with practical hands-on experience and online labs geared toward junior and fresh information security candidates.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Soft skills</strong>: Technical knowledge is not the only prerequisite, but soft and personal skills are crucial to success in information security. Complex situations or weird unknown problems that need real problem management and strong troubleshooting skills will frequently be faced. This will require patience and complete dedication until the problem is fixed or resolved. Other situations will require inquiring and interviewing key personnel, which requires a professional to be very analytical and organized. There are several workshops dealing with group thinking and decision-making techniques, as well as professional technical writing and presentation skills.</li>
<li><strong>Focus on a specific specialty (your strength)</strong>: Information security spans several areas, such as networks, the cloud, identity, mobiles, the web, applications, analytics, hacking, and so on. A career-oriented professional needs to pick one or two areas that they can master comfortably and focus on them. Nobody can ever cover all areas with the same level of expertise. Maximizing strong points is imperative. Always remember: <em>Jack of all trades, master of none</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Linux versus Windows knowledge</strong>: Any security professional needs to have basic knowledge of Linux. Most of the available hacking and penetration testing tools are based on a Linux distribution, such as Offensive Security's Kali Linux. Nobody will ever be a good security professional without learning Linux and understanding its main commands. It is advisable to go ahead and download a Linux distribution on a virtual machine and start playing with it. It can also be installed along with a Windows OS (dual boot) or run directly from a live CD. There are several resources and user forums on the internet that can help build your knowledge with Linux. Regarding basic Linux courses, you are highly advised to take the CompTIA Linux+ course as a start.</li>
<li><strong>Programming and scripting</strong>: Similar to Linux knowledge, all security professionals need to have basic programming and scripting skills. From time to time, some kind of written code will be needed. Python will be a very good start for any security professional. It is a very powerful tool and well-documented, with several sites and free resources. When getting more involved with software security, databases, and web exploits, you might consider other deep programming languages.</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Also, PowerShell would be an excellent start if you want to write small scripts and functions to manage your system and automate several tasks. Several free and online courses are available.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Professional courses</strong>: All the aforementioned steps will lay down a solid career foundation. To move on to the next step, an in-depth professional information security course is needed. I would highly recommend going with CISSP from ISC2; this is a very in-depth, solid course covering most information security areas, and at the same time, it's a highly valuable badge when added to your resumé.</li>
</ul>
<p style="color: black;padding-left: 60px">Another different track that is considered a real professional practical hacking course is the Offensive Security OSCP (pen testing with Kali Linux). This is an online course where students can study on their own and practice online on the Offensive Security labs. To gain this certificate, a given number of systems need to be hacked within a specific amount of time.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Practice on your own</strong>: Time and effort must be invested to gain experience. It is all about how much you are willing to spend learning and exploring new tools and techniques. Virtualization makes this easy. Now, a couple of machines can be created and used to simulate and attack a victim with different OSes and start applying the attack and pen-testing tools on the victim's VM. At any point, the old snapshot from the virtual machine can be restored and the hacker can start all over again.</li>
</ul>
<p style="color: black"><strong>My journey into cybersecurity</strong></p>
<p style="color: black">More than 25 years ago, I dreamed of learning and studying computer science and information technology; perhaps because I was the gaming expert in the family or the computer geek who could magically assemble a computer, format it, and build it from scratch. But my father had another vision, that computers and technology were still in their infancy and it would be better to study a traditional engineering degree to better secure my career. Accordingly, I picked electrical and electronics engineering as the closest path to technology that would allow me to switch later if this new green field turned out to be promising.</p>
<p style="color: black">I joined the university and excelled in the electrical engineering field. I was top of my class and tried to relate everything to computers, picking most of the projects that required programming, or the ones with computer simulation and analytics, which is, of course, done through a computer.</p>
<p style="color: black">During my fourth year at university, I got to know the world of information technology certificates and all the acronyms, and Microsoft MCSE was a dream and a kind of a passport that opened every closed door. I bought my first book (which I still have, somewhere in my library) and started the first step to get my MCSE (Microsoft Certified System Engineer) with Networking Essentials. In those days, you wouldn't go directly to Windows servers and networking/infrastructure configurations, but would first learn the network fundamentals and the underlying layers, through to the physical layer with all the cables and connections.</p>
<p style="color: black">I graduated in the year 2000, with honors, and was hired as an electrical engineer in my current organization. Although I progressed smoothly in my job, I never really felt I was in the right position, being able to identify and unleash my full capabilities. Therefore, I took the decision to continue studying and working on my dream. So, in the first year of my career, I worked during the weekends (Fridays and Saturdays), studying and attending IT courses by CISCO and Microsoft, either at home or at the office, and attending courses after hours and during weekends. In doing so, I came across several challenging and interesting technologies. I passed all the necessary exams and I was an MCSE, finally. That is a moment I will never forget, especially when I received my certificate signed by Bill Gates!</p>
<p style="color: black">The hard work paid off when, luckily, two members from the IT group in our company left and they were looking for a replacement, and my direct manager called me for a meeting and asked whether I was interested. This was my chance; I immediately accepted the offer and shifted my career to IT that very day. That is a decision I will never regret; it triggered my passion and energy, and even now, I am glad that I followed my instinct.</p>
<p style="color: black">I progressed through all IT positions and technologies: from service desk; to networking; to system and application administration, including security, which was part of system administration at that time. If you were managing your domain, networks, and infrastructure, then you would normally handle the firewall and endpoint protection as well. There was no clear, fine line between IT and IS until computer attacks and hackers' actions started to impact the business around the world. I still remember the massive <strong>Distributed Denial of Service</strong> (<strong>DDoS</strong>) attacks that hit most of the domain names around 2003 and the world began to realize the threats posed by internet attacks and the possibility of getting disconnected from the world.</p>
<p style="color: black">All organizations, especially the ones dependent on communication and collaboration, started to invest in security. That was the peak time for firewalls and concepts such as DMZ and endpoint protection/management, and again I was lucky enough to be on top of those efforts, managing, administering, and getting trained on the latest technologies to protect and safeguard our data and applications.</p>
<p style="color: black">Hacking, internet attacks, viruses, and more significant methodologies continued to evolve, especially with the move to online transactions and online business websites, and companies started to invest more in web filters and advanced firewalls. I attended my first hacking/security course, which was CEH (EC-Council), which opened another door to the security and hacking environment. CEH will provide you with a basic foundation in different ethical hacking areas, which can be a good starting point.</p>
<p style="color: black">I took all EC-Council courses covering forensics and penetration testing, and then I switched to the famous elite information security certificate CISSP, which again provided me with broad coverage of all information security domains.</p>
<p style="color: black">During the 2012/2013 time frame, and with a lot of new regulations, laws, and governance programs, in addition to the new digital transformation initiatives, organizations started to have a dedicated <strong>Chief Information Security Officer</strong> (<strong>CISO</strong>), and sometimes it was a mandate, especially in organizations dealing with public sectors. Based on my previous experience and certifications, I was the perfect nominee to handle and manage the information security efforts and digital transformation initiative.</p>
<p style="color: black">I never thought I would get attracted to such a career and track. It's very challenging, dynamic, and rewarding at the same time. Feeling that people have confidence to ensure their data and main assets are protected and secured under your custody is the best reward. Being constantly exposed to the latest security trends and technologies always keeps you challenged. If I could summarize my journey up till now, I would simply say <em>"follow your passion."</em></p>
<p style="color: black"><strong>Who is Ahmed Nabil Mahmoud?</strong></p>
<p style="color: black">Ahmed Nabil has more than 20 years of experience in the field of information technology, infrastructure, systems administration/engineering, security systems, and IT management, and holds several professional IT certifications from Microsoft, Cisco, PMI, CWNP, and EC-Council.</p>

<p style="color: black">Cybersecurity Architect, Microsoft</p>
<p><strong>Past, present, and future</strong></p>
<p style="color: black">The concept of information security can be traced back through the history of controlling information, as this has always been paramount. It needs no examples. Since the early days of the computer's existence, the need for securing the information they manage has been brought forward and has gone through an evolutionary process in the way we secure information and the mechanisms that handle and process information. One of the oldest examples that we can look at is the way the Roman dictator Julius Caesar secured his message transmissions. He used a form of transmitting encrypted information to his generals on the battlefield, which was impossible to decode by his enemies at the time. This method would eventually be known as the Caesar cipher, which is possibly the oldest known code. It was a substitution cipher.</p>
<p style="color: black">During the twentieth century, technologies were born at an unprecedented rate. Even by the start of the twentieth century, the world was already getting flooded with the use of the most important inventions in history, telephones and radios; these two technologies would change the whole world in the coming decades. Suddenly, everyone wanted to make use of the new technologies, including individual citizens, governments, businesses, and especially the military. The telegraph/telephony and radio proved to be the most beneficial pieces of equipment that the military could have, from then until now. Even though these systems solved one of the major gaps in inter-personal communications, they had a major flaw in their design: the communication lines of telegraphs and telephones, and radio communication, could be tapped into and messages intercepted. This gave rise to the need to encrypt lines and radio communication, especially for the military.</p>
<p style="color: black">At the time of World War II, the military was using methods that were similar to the substitution cipher, and they were easily breakable by cryptanalysts. There was a dire need for a strong mechanism to secure data before, during, and after transmission, so that even if radio signals were intercepted, which was a very common thing for the opposition to do, it couldn't be decrypted. This dire need then gave rise to the most complex data security method, with the help of available technology during the war. This machine was known as <strong>Enigma</strong>.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p style="color: black">Enigma was a physical machine that was used to perform data encryption while typing a message, and used an electromechanical rotary mechanism to encrypt and decrypt messages before and after transmission; originally, these were devices for banks to perform the secure transfer of financial data, but the Germans started using it for all their war-time communications to send encrypted messages to their troops in the field. Just to give you a scale, Enigma had about 150 trillion possible combinations with a poly-alphabetic substitution cipher, meaning that a single alphabet would go through substitution multiple times to finally arrive at a substitution alphabet, and the same had to be reversed to get the original alphabet. This technology was literally causing the allies a lot of trouble to keep up with the war, and they were desperate to break the Enigma code. There were various attempts and various research done at the time to break the code. But eventually, it was broken by Alan Turing, in 1941, which shortened the war by 2 years. Alan Turing is also known as <em>the Father of Artificial Intelligence</em>.</p>
<p style="color: black">During the last quarter of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, many new technologies emerged, and so did security concerns; at that time, security was only focused on physical systems and making sure no unauthorized personnel had access to them. Basically, locking down physical devices and systems, and only allowing certain authorized persons to access them physically was more important. But this scenario soon changed with changes in the technology landscape. Our early computers were single-user systems, and later, computers became multi-user systems that could be remotely accessed, which made security professionals rethink the approach toward the overall security of access to applications and networks by users. This gave birth to the concept of authentication—to access files based on the user and their need. This concept led to the possibility of a shared system. But this concept had a flaw, because it needed to be configured properly to give the right permissions to the right person, otherwise information leakage could occur.</p>
<p style="color: black">This scenario became more serious with further advancements in personal computers. With the introduction of <strong>Transmission Control Protocol</strong> (<strong>TCP</strong>) and <strong>Internet Protocol</strong> (<strong>IP</strong>), the entire technology landscape was revolutionized and the computer industry was taken to a new level. And due to the existence of TCP/IP and other, newer client-server models, it was obvious that these systems were getting connected over the telephone network. This connectivity requirement was one of the main reasons why ARPANET, our early internet, came into existence in 1973. Even though, in the beginning, it only connected just a few universities, it evolved into today's internet. This primary requirement of interconnectivity to share data across networks brought new applications into existence.</p>
<p style="color: black">As technology kept progressing at an unprecedented rate, it also gave birth to two important innovations, <strong>Hyper Text Transfer Protocol</strong> (<strong>HTTP</strong>) and the <strong>World Wide Web</strong> (<strong>WWW</strong>). After this, there was an explosion of new and innovative things. The internet became an essential tool for every business for information sharing. People were buying and selling things over the internet, and they were performing banking and other business operations. Even governments started communicating over this network, as it was now convenient. There was no limit to how much and what you could share, but again, one thing did not change: the sharing and processing of data<em>—</em>what changed over this period was the type of data and information. People started sharing audio, video, and images, and that became a part of our lives in the twenty-first century. This constitutes the new-age data, which is the fodder for cybercriminals.</p>
<p style="color: black">The latter part of the twentieth century and the beginning of the twenty-first century was an interesting time. During that time, something new was introduced every day. While it was interesting to move at a fast pace, it also brought security concerns, which was struggling to keep pace with the rate of change. Applications and systems were appearing so fast that sometimes developers and engineers overlooked, or perhaps underestimated, the need to build them secure from the beginning. A whole new community of enthusiasts, individuals with good and bad intentions, started to come into existence, and they started breaking applications and systems where they could find any gaps or flaws, sometimes to prove their point that applications were weak, or sometimes just for personal financial gain by misusing a system or the data captured. The requirement to secure information systems was realized by governments too during the latter part of the twentieth century, and they started to come up with laws and regulations related to computer fraud and crime.</p>
<p style="color: black">In 1983, after ARPANET was made available for public use with no restrictions and moved to new protocols such as TCP/IP, it brought a tsunami of technological changes that led to the emergence of new architectures. But this also brought its own perimeter security challenges. Suddenly, it was also evident that there was a gap in security architectures and that information could be exposed. Once again, military concepts helped, building virtual boundaries with a certain set of rules built into systems guarding the boundaries; whom to allow, whom not to allow. Basically, the focus was to position a gatekeeper around a corporate network boundary and interact via that gatekeeper with other outside organizations. This was named a firewall. These devices were simple packet-filtering appliances. The earliest firewalls, commonly known as first-generation firewalls, would often block or allow traffic by inspecting TCP/IP packets, based on the filtering rules defined on the firewalls.</p>
<p style="color: black">These filtering rules can be applied in many ways, such as screening the source and destination IP addresses, the type of protocol, or even based on source and destination port numbers; it could even be a combination of those together. Slowly, firewalls made progress and evolved generation by generation. The following generations of firewalls brought in features such as application layer filtering; application-level firewalls will typically examine the stream of data rather than just the TCP/IP packets. These allowed the making of advanced-level decisions to act on packets when they were passing through these devices. Because first-generation firewalls never inspected application-level data streams, they were vulnerable to certain attacks and backdoors. Application firewalls can now be configured to inspect some known vulnerabilities and stop them.</p>
<p style="color: black">With advancements in computers and networked systems, the need for identity-based access also increased. Because more and more web-based applications started popping up all around, this raised a never-ending need for the use of identity and access management systems to access applications over the internet. Early IAM was extremely complex, costly, and a maintenance nightmare. In the early years of 2000, as the need to secure online systems rose, this required IAM systems to become part of computer security. Slowly and steadily, IAM frameworks also started improving; the expectation from any IAM system was now to provide assurance about any identity with proper rightful access to resources, applications, and networks. By and large, all legacy and modern IAM systems depend on certain policies and principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>The way you identify resources</li>
<li>What roles you assign to resources</li>
<li>User management</li>
<li>How IAM controls security and the access of data, applications, and location-specific access</li>
<li>An IAM system should be able to enforce user rights and access rights</li>
<li>Must be able to track user activity</li>
<li style="color: black">User activity logging capabilities for audit purposes, in real time and historically</li>
</ul>
<p style="color: black">With the boom in networked systems and applications getting connected all over the internet, the attack surface also increased. Perimeter security devices and mechanisms were not enough anymore. The industry now needed a system that allowed us to secure our systems, applications, and network proactively, in real time. We needed monitoring systems to keep an eye on attacks against our infrastructure. Implementing a monitoring system could be quite complex, as we needed to know what exactly we should be monitoring, where should we be monitoring, and which application logs we needed to ingest for the proper monitoring of anomalous behavior by applying log analysis or correlation techniques against known bad factors.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p style="color: black">Security monitoring as we know it is one of the integral processes in the whole story of cybersecurity. Security monitoring provides any organization with the ability to detect and analyze events from the enterprise network, applications, endpoints, and user activities. This capability is core to the <strong>Security Operations Center</strong> (<strong>SOC</strong>). Typically, the SOC has three elements to it: people process, and technology. While the technology helps drive the monitoring of assets such as networks, applications, endpoints, servers, web applications, and various other systems, and generates alerts through automatic correlation and analysis, people in SOCs focus on validating these alerts manually and try to make sense out of them, to further carry out the response process to identify threats and provide detailed information to remediation teams. All modern SOCs these days also tend to integrate the digital forensics process and malware reverse engineering too. Any SOC will have seasoned security analysts as one of its important assets.</p>
<p style="color: black">The range of cyber attacks and their sophistication is on the rise today. All recent attacks have been successful in bypassing existing security solutions, traditional or advanced. These attacks were successful because they were able to hide within the legitimate realm of our network and infrastructure. Our current security solutions are designed to detect threats based on scanning for known issues, filtering, or dropping bad actors, or even trying to monitor identity and user habits, and so on, but these things are not able to deter attacks. The primary reason is that these are still focused on reacting to a security event, responding to the security findings of security events that have happened, and lastly, planning for how to recover from them. In other words, its a <strong>reactive security response</strong><em>.</em> A reactive response is good, but does not hold ground to a level where it can compete with the advanced attacks of today. We need to redirect our focus toward a <strong>proactive security response</strong>, and the industry today is moving from a reactive to proactive security response already. This is a paradigm shift in security frameworks and methodologies on how we predict, analyze, and respond to threats. Unlike in a reactive form of security response, proactive methodologies provide greater in-depth visibility into the attack infrastructure. Simply put, a proactive method is to approach from an attacker's view of the attack surface and try to predict attacks in advance and apply proper measures.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p style="color: black">As the logic goes, a reactive security response model is the mindset of <em>"if and when there is an attack,</em> <em>the systems and security analysts will respond to it."</em> It's about laying a trap with known attack parameters and methods and waiting for the monitoring and detection systems to react to it. In a reactive form, the attention is always given to form a strong perimeter defense to thwart attacks that attempt to penetrate the network. This form of security is very much localized to the business unit and its activities, and it does not take advantage of attacks of a similar nature, against another business or industry verticals. Reactive security does not provide a 360° view of the threat landscape but a reactive way of achieving security operations is always simpler, faster to bring up, and has lower operational costs. Reactive security monitoring can be further enhanced with data feeds from antivirus detection systems, vulnerability scanners, and, at times, DLP systems. The flip side of such a model is that it will always react to security detection after a breach or compromise has occurred.</p>
<p style="color: black">But proactive security monitoring and responses win over this scenario. It is an intelligence-driven model, where the system is enriched with actionable intelligence data, from multiple internal and external sources, working in line with existing real-time monitoring systems. This proactive method will have visibility of the entire threat landscape and all phases of the cyber kill chain, and not just focus on one or partial phases of the kill chain. One of the key aspects of proactive security is threat hunting, which allows analysts to get more insights into the network and systems by trying to uncover any anomalies, or any abnormal changes in network behavior, any presence of known bad files in the systems, or maybe there are some registry entries that can be found from previously known attacks. As an analyst, you can also look for known <strong>indicators of compromise</strong> (<strong>IOCs</strong>) in the network. Threat hunting is a continuous process and will always involve trying to look for a new set of information as received from threat intelligence sources. Threat hunting can also be done automatically by looking into network behavior, system anomalies, timeline analysis of certain events, looking into the baseline data of the network and the system for a period, and so on.</p>
<p style="color: black">Today, every organization is extremely worried about the data it holds and how to secure it. Sensitiveness toward data is at an all-time high. In our efforts to keep data safe and be proactive in detecting any threats toward it, we must have proper and effective threat intelligence in place. Threat intelligence can be achieved by acquiring specific threat information (intelligence) about various systems, processes, networks, applications, perimeter defense mechanisms, and other IT assets. This data is then collected, analyzed, and enriched to provide proactive and actionable threat intelligence. One of the reasons threat intelligence is so important is because current threats are highly sophisticated and difficult to detect. We must acquire very specific information and perform a search for signs of compromise with actionable content from any threat intel source. To stay ahead of advanced threats, it is essential that we feed our analytic and correlation systems with proper threat data.</p>
<p style="color: black">Any effective and mature threat intelligence system must be able to collect and categorize threat information in real time to produce actionable threat intelligence for the SIEM and incident response systems to analyze and correlate the collected threat information with the security alerts and events it is monitoring. These threat alerts from the threat intel system will also empower SOC professionals to create custom signatures for further detection. Threat intelligence systems gather various pieces of information related to incidents, events, logs, security vulnerabilities, recent and past known attack data, detection data from the security and network devices of the organization, along with information from external threat feeds. You can also set up a honey pot system to collect attack information and use it as threat data. All data collection needs to be focused and meaningful for the organization that intends to use it, because every business is different, with distinct needs and types of infrastructure. For threat intelligence to be effective, the collection of intelligence data must be done in a centralized manner, as systems collect threats and vulnerability information from a wide range of locations and devices to correlate data. You must collect data from both internal and external sources, as both combined will provide more detailed information on threats and attack vectors, specific to your industry or organization. Also, focus on collecting information about any ongoing global attack and its attack vectors, related mitigation instructions and detection parameters from agencies such as government CERT, NIST, ENISA, and so on, along with industry sources, Cisco, Symantec, McAfee, Microsoft, RSA, and other major vendors. You may also focus on open source threat intel such as OSINT, SANS Internet Storm Center, and Open Threat Exchange. All this collected threat information needs to be properly categorized and segregated based on threat types, and its importance to the business entity and function; it could be, for example, based on the geolocation of the business unit, the business applications you are using, and IT infrastructures. Geolocation is important from the perspective of identifying where the threat actually originated so that you can have more of a focus on those business locations of yours as a priority, as they may have been affected; this could also help establish whether it is a targeted attack toward your organization, or maybe a country. This scenario can help you pinpoint the most effected business function, application, or unit, and gives you room for remediation in advance, or at least on time, before it's too late. It will also help in defining proper mitigation and a detection strategy to focus on the proper utilization of resources since it is always limited, irrespective of the size of the organization.</p>
<p style="color: black">A successful threat intelligence system must be able to generate and distribute reports about all of its findings and related investigations to help others involved in the security protection, investigation, and monitoring process to carry out their necessary work at various levels of operations, engineering, and strategic decision-making by governance bodies. Reporting can be via any real-time methods or publishing online advisories. Security threat intelligence advisory might also be shared among industry peers via threat exchange mechanisms such as STIX or the Traffic Light Protocol, for everyone to take advantage of and stay ahead of any attacks.</p>
<p style="color: black">Since we have witnessed a rise in cyber attacks in the past few years, we are all convinced that prevention and monitoring are just the initial steps of being prepared against any cybersecurity attacks. What we should do is develop more threat hunting capabilities and internal threat intelligence, and strong incident responses empowered by digital forensics investigation.</p>
<p style="color: black">Most organizations in the industry today are already using SIEM as their primary and central monitoring platform. Traditionally, we have always used SIEM as a platform that receives information from the rest of the network, as we mentioned earlier in this chapter, to correlate and identify threats and security incidents. In essence, SIEM has always acted like a device that listens but doesn't say a word. However, with today's cybersecurity scenarios, it is prudent for SIEM to take a much larger part in the whole process, to say things and collaborate in taking action. One prominent activity that SIEM can be tasked with is integrating with digital forensic platforms to receive more rich and tactical information in real time. Digital evidence, by nature, is extremely volatile, and this also drives the response time for any security incident. This fragile and crucial nature of digital evidence in any cybersecurity incident forces us to approach the problem in a fully automated way. This calls for an automated way of collecting digital evidence from a suspected device, and we should do it right on time and integrate this telemetry with SIEM to trigger the collection of evidence from endpoints, just like a security camera starts recording the actions of a criminal with the help of a motion sensor. This, in turn, provides us with detailed information about what took place and also provides us with more accurate evidence that is collected at the right time—<em>the time when the incident took place, and not later</em>. By capturing the state of a compromised machine right after it provides shell access to cyber criminals, providing an initial analysis of the collected evidence, and making everything ready for a deep dive investigation, will help us turn the tables on the bad guys. Actually, this is only the beginning; we should also develop systems/platforms that will automatically analyze collected evidence and enrich this with threat intelligence to gain speed and accuracy.</p>
<p style="color: black">In the present-day scenario, cybersecurity is gaining more importance than we could ever imagine with the ever-increasing threats and attacks on our information technology assets. This sudden shift in the industry has raised another important question and concern: is our workforce skilled enough to fight this battle? Do we have enough talent that can help secure our networks, applications, infrastructures, and, most importantly, our business and personal data? The talent gap is growing day by day, and as per research from many analysis firms, the gap could be as high as over one million.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p style="color: black">Today, it is a fact that this shortage is no longer just a statistic, but a reality. And because of this fact, it is our responsibility to bridge that gap by increasing cybersecurity skills to fill this huge gap over a period. This brings us to the point where we can ask what skills are needed to start in cybersecurity or to switch to a cybersecurity career from an existing career? What do employers look for when they set out to hire cybersecurity talent? But this shortage of skills, talent, and experienced candidates is not stopping cyber criminals from stepping back; in fact, they know that most organizations may not have an adequate work force to defend attacks. It's, in a sense, working in their favor.</p>
<p style="color: black">To some extent, our rapid growth and innovation in information technology is also responsible for this gap increasing each day. Today, if I look back into the past, technologies were not so diverse and did not change so rapidly either. It was easy to fix security issues, as they were all so steady. But in the current situation, technology is moving faster than ever, and we in the security profession are always playing catch-up. By the time we do catch up with the latest technology and understand how to secure it, the technology moves on again. This scenario is not going to change; rather, this will become the norm for the future. To some extent, as per many industry experts and analysts, who track changes in the industry, this gap in cybersecurity is also because of the gender gap. It is estimated that the ratio between the male and female workforce in the cybersecurity industry could be 8.5: 1.5. Filling the gender gap could certainly help fulfill the need of the hour, but this is not the only area that can solve this issue. We also need to involve more and more ex-military personnel. Veterans don't need to be taught the essence and importance of security; its hardwired into them already, by design, and cybersecurity concepts are still being driven from military terms and best practices. Also, the gap could be filled to some extent by retraining professionals from fields other than IT.</p>
<p style="color: black">Everyone who wants to start in cybersecurity needs to have some basic information technology skills, know how the web works, how applications work, how system administration is done, and what the security standards are that govern security policies (at a very basic level). I often hear that, if someone wants to start in cybersecurity, then they need to have very strong technical skills in certain areas, but given the situation today with the skills and the talent gap, I think it's illogical not to ramp up others, too. Security is not just one person's, or one group of security specialists' job; it's the job of everyone to know about cybersecurity and to contribute in whatever way they can. So, the skills required for cybersecurity can be built over a period of time. I am not saying that someone can become an expert in a few weeks, or months, but if someone chooses to be in the domain, or make this their career, then they can start at the level they are currently at and grow from there. Gradually, they will become experts over a period of time.</p>
<p style="color: black">You may think that cybersecurity is very technical, but it's not always the case; anyone who wishes to work in this domain should also possess or develop some soft and other non-technical skills too, such as being very meticulous about how they plan activities related to the security of an infrastructure or design it. Think and act in detail; think about all the possible ways to secure a system, data, or infrastructure; know about the business you are in; and properly define a strategy to make sure the business is not impacted on because you just want to implement security very robustly. You also need to develop strong analytical skills, so that you can find the actual root cause and not just be superficial about coming to a conclusion. Some of the skills that follow are the most sought-after in the industry today:</p>
<ul>
<li style="color: black"><strong>Network security:</strong> As a network security engineer, you need to develop or possess skills on how to maintain and design LAN, WAN, and complex network architectures. Having knowledge of a scripting language and how to develop custom scripts for automating certain network-level tasks will be an added advantage, as networks today are vast and complex, and if you are able to automate tasks that are repetitive and time-consuming, it will be a great advantage. Experience around network protocols is essential if you plan to pursue a career as a network engineer and you are from a different domain; it will be helpful and advantageous to add additional knowledge about network protocols and their working principles. Network security professionals also need to be aware of the regulatory norms, policies, and controls, which will help them maintain IT security compliance and legal aspects. You can focus on the knowledge and skills mentioned here to ramp up a network security engineer profile:
<ul>
<li>Firewalls and switches</li>
<li>Routers and WAN equipment</li>
<li>Knowledge of subnetting, DNS, VPN, and VLANs</li>
<li>An understanding of network- and web-related protocols</li>
<li>Encryption technologies</li>
<li>Threat modeling for network design</li>
<li>Virtualization experience would be an added advantage in today's cloud world</li>
<li>Scripting language proficiency</li>
<li>The ability to solve complex problems</li>
<li>Network design and architecture related skills and techniques</li>
<li>Understanding security regulations and compliance</li>
<li>Knowledge about antivirus systems</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="color: black"><strong>Application security:</strong> More than ever, the industry needs many application security engineers as the need for applicants has increased manyfold. This is because of the adoption of digitization in all areas of the industry today. Application security engineers and architects are very important to any application development teams and organizations. Progression toward becoming an application security engineer is also a long journey. This is because people who want to work in this area of security need to understand how any software application works in depth, and how to design a better and more efficient working application. It's possible that engineers who have spent a considerable amount of time developing applications will smoothly transition to become an application security engineer over a period of time, with proper planning, to develop the additional skills required. Also, there is much more training and many other certifications that are available to speed up the process; we will talk about those in <a href="6db093ec-4c27-4f86-8025-b6a5df56780a.xhtml">Chapter 9</a>, <em>Knowledge Check and Certifications</em>. From a skill development perspective, you can plan to acquire experience in the areas mentioned here:
<ul>
<li>Strong knowledge about <strong>Secure Development Life Cycle</strong> methodologies (<strong>SDLC</strong>)</li>
<li>Application threat modeling</li>
<li>Working knowledge of APIs and their functionalities</li>
<li>Web server and database-related skills</li>
<li>Strong knowledge about application protocols</li>
<li>Encryption technologies and how to use them to secure application and data handling</li>
<li>Secure coding methodologies</li>
<li>The ability to perform secure code reviews (automated and manual)</li>
<li>Standards and capabilities for authentication/authorization mechanisms and related technologies</li>
<li>Strong knowledge about web services</li>
<li>Knowledge about software threats and vulnerabilities, and how they get exploited</li>
<li>Knowledge about software security standards and controls</li>
<li>Application penetration testing skills</li>
<li>Security architecture skills and how to develop them</li>
<li>Skills related to secure software designs and frameworks</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="color: black"><strong>Vulnerability assessment and penetration testing</strong>: Vulnerability assessment and penetration testing, known as VA/PT in the industry, is one of the important key verticals of the cybersecurity ecosystem. The process of VA/PT assures organizations and security researchers that their information systems are up to date and are not exposed to any critical security risks. VA/PT also helps you to be proactive in finding security threats and risks before attackers do. The VA/PT stream is very exciting and is a highly hands-on field. Apart from security consulting firms and big corporations, currently, many product development organizations also have their own teams for VA/PT as part of their product security teams. VA/PT researchers use various scanning tools to scan the network, applications, and/or other IT assets, such as servers during these scanning activities and try to find as many vulnerabilities as possible that could be exploited by attackers. Scripting knowledge can be very useful here, because, as a researcher, you can then develop your own custom scripts to test information technology assets.</li>
</ul>
<p style="color: black;padding-left: 60px">If you are from a software development and quality assurance background, then VA/PT would be the logical choice. Your in-depth knowledge about software functionality could be extremely beneficial in understanding why certain vulnerabilities exist. Similarly, if there is someone from a network background, their knowledge and experience about networks would be crucial to understanding network-related vulnerabilities. In a sense, almost everyone who has hands-on experience in information technology could choose this domain as their next career step. Today, VA/PT by itself is much in demand. Some of the skills that you can rely upon or plan to learn if you choose this as your next career step are as follows:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: none">
<li style="list-style-type: none">
<ul>
<li>Static analysis, fuzzing, and manual and automated testing of networks, applications, and other IT assets.</li>
<li><strong>SAST</strong>: <strong>Static Application Security Testing</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>DAST</strong>: <strong>Dynamic Application Security Testing</strong>.</li>
<li>Black, grey, and white box testing to conduct both VA and PT.</li>
<li>Adequate knowledge about how to measure security risk and exposure.</li>
<li>Ramp up on security regulations and laws (such as PHI, PII, SOX, PCI, HIPAA, ISO, GDPR, and others). This is important when you have to do VA/PT for a customer or for your own organization.</li>
<li>Develop in-depth knowledge about security protocols and network protocols (TCP/IP, HTTP, HTTPS, IPSEC, VPN, and so on).</li>
<li>Learn how network devices such as firewalls, IDS, IPS, switches, and routers work. This will help when performing network-related VA/PT.</li>
<li>Learn scripting languages such as Python, Ruby, PowerShell, Perl, JavaScript, and Bash, among many others.</li>
<li>Learn popular VA/PT tools such as Metasploit, Nessus, Kali Linux, Burp Suite, OpenVAS, Qualys Guard, Core Impact, Acunetix, AppScan, Nmap, and PSTools.</li>
<li>Keep track of SANS Top 20 and OWASP top 10.</li>
<li>Learn techniques such as SQL injection, XSS, remote file inclusion, PHP/ASP, and code injection.</li>
<li>Sound operating system knowledge would be an added advantage.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="color: black"><strong>Security Operations and Incident Response</strong>: All organizations need security monitoring and incident response capabilities. The security analyst's job in a SOC or a CSIRT is to analyze and investigate each threat that comes toward the organization. They must also work toward providing a detailed incident response, contain the damage to a minimum, and at the same time provide enough threat intelligence to ensure that similar threats and issues are not repeated in future. A SOC will have <strong>Security Information and Event Management</strong> (<strong>SIEM</strong>) software to detect, investigate, and respond to any security alert/incident, and malicious activities. SIEM generates alerts by correlating logs, alerts, security event logs, and other telemetry from a wide variety of systems and network devices. SIEM is the most important tool that security analysts use in a SOC.</li>
</ul>
<p style="color: black;padding-left: 60px">Organizations are constantly on the lookout for skilled and seasoned analysts and incident responders for their security monitoring efforts. Professionals from network operations, system administrators, and other security service areas can look forward to becoming security analysts or incident responders, and this is one of the most technical and hands-on roles, where the analyst needs to know common and advanced attacker techniques, how to detect various incidents, what to look for in those incidents, and how to analyze them. At the same time, they need to be aware of security regulations, laws, policies, and protocols when handling any security incident in SOC, as well as an incident response. Both roles—SOC and IR—have gone through a complete transformation in the way we work in these areas today.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p style="color: black;padding-left: 60px">It now involves a diverse skill set, such as collaboration with analysts, log analysis skills, expertise around digital forensics, malware analysis or knowledge about the working mechanisms of any malware in depth, a very keen eye to detect and pinpoint anomalies in network communications, application and user behavior, and also how certain servers and security devices work. SOC in the present day is evolving as CDOC, or centralized security centers with every capability, such as governance, legal, infosec, incident responders, digital forensics, security engineering, and security QAs, besides traditional security analysts, and it will continue to transform further. If you are planning to choose SOC and/or IR as your next career move, then the first thing you need to focus on is serious discipline in regards to how you work, what you work on, how you execute your tasks, what and how you communicate, and more importantly with whom. Let's discuss the list of skills that you will need:</p>
<ul>
<li style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>Communication skills</strong>: Knowing how to communicate effectively in SOC/CDOC/IR work is crucial. You must be able to get to the facts, find as many details as possible, and include them in your communication. More importantly, knowing who to talk to and what to discuss, and being able to control the flow and content of information, are key factors. Communication in SOC/CDOC/IR includes your responses to emails, providing accuracy and not giving away anything that is not required, the documentation of incidents and related technical details, notifications to appropriate teams or individuals through the proper channels, learning how to communicate with external parties, such as law enforcement or legal entities, and more. You also must have insight into your escalation tree and protocols of escalation. It is essential to maintain an updated list of incidents as well.</li>
<li style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>Following standards</strong>: You must focus on acquiring knowledge about policies and procedures about the organization you work with, or industry standard best practices. Adhering to policies and procedures is very important for the type of work carried out in an SOC and IR environment. Procedures and policies also ensure consistency in the response toward an incident or the event analysis.</li>
<li style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>Integrity</strong>: This is another key skill that you need to develop when it comes to security operations. This is because you will always be dealing with sensitive information. Any untimely leak or release of information may cause serious and costly damage to the organization. You need to be very discrete in handling and communicating information and incidents.</li>
<li style="padding-left: 60px">Learning security principles, such as authentication, access control, and non-repudiation can be useful.</li>
<li style="padding-left: 60px">Knowledge about security vulnerabilities and risks about systems, applications, network resources, endpoints, and operating systems.</li>
<li style="padding-left: 60px">Learning protocols and related flaws that could be exploited for malicious use, such as spoofing attacks or DOS attacks, overflow attacks, flood attacks, and others.</li>
<li style="padding-left: 60px">If you are from an IT and network admin background, then your knowledge about configurations could be very useful, as you may be able to use your experience to detect configuration flaws and weaknesses. For others who are new to this, you may have to spend time learning about it.</li>
<li style="padding-left: 60px">All SOC personnel must have a strong understanding of assessing and analyzing security risks.</li>
<li style="padding-left: 60px">You must also focus on gaining some experience or skills to understand network devices and how they work to a moderate level as you must know what <strong>demilitarized zones</strong> (<strong>DMZs</strong>) are.</li>
<li style="padding-left: 60px">Learn about how routers secure a network and how packet filtering and packet monitoring devices/applications work.</li>
<li style="padding-left: 60px">Gain knowledge about firewalls and how they protect a network.</li>
<li style="padding-left: 60px">Strong knowledge and understanding of endpoint and operating system-level security risks and issues: how hardening works, how systems get compromised, how and what system logs need to be reviewed, and how to keep data safe in systems and endpoints using various technologies.</li>
<li style="padding-left: 60px">One of the most crucial skills is the understanding of malicious code, viruses, Trojans, and advanced malware. You must enhance your skills to know how they work, what their behaviors are, and how you can detect those activities. Anyone from a malware reverse engineering background will be able to better utilize their skills as a security analyst in SOC and IR work.</li>
<li style="padding-left: 60px">Having programming skills or people from a programming background can be very useful. They can help the SOC team to develop custom tools and scripts to detect threats. On the other hand, they will have a very good hold on software vulnerabilities, which certainly will come in handy while averting threats.</li>
<li style="padding-left: 60px">Developing an incident analysis mindset so that you can quickly analyze an incident by looking into facts such as why the incident happened, who is or might be involved, timeline analysis, and which system/application could have caused the incident.</li>
<li style="color: black"><strong>Malware analysis and reverse engineering</strong>: Malware analysis is highly technical and a fully hands-on role in cybersecurity. Reverse engineering plays the role of breaking apart malicious software, malware, viruses, and any other software packages to understand the inner workings of the mechanism. Reverse engineering, commonly known as RE, can reveal a great deal of information about any malicious package—when it was created, what code was used to achieve certain goals, what systems, processes, or applications it impacts, and which other files or processes it calls to stay stealthy or fulfill its motive. Reverse malware engineers use a variety of tools to unpack and disassemble malware files. They also need to be experienced in how files are packaged and packed and know about encryption, compression, and other technologies related to file systems. Engineers will have to use tools such as disassemblers, debuggers, and network traffic analyzers, file behavior analyzers, log monitoring, sandbox technologies, and other tools. As a malware analyst, you will also have to perform tasks on potential samples that the organization has detected from its incident response or other security processes. You will need to establish the impact the malware may be having on the business or the organization. While performing malware analysis, you will also have to tackle the problem of finding out the <strong>Indicator of Compromise</strong> (<strong>IOCs</strong>)-related information. IOC-related threat intelligence is extremely crucial to create a proactive defense against any future attacks.</li>
</ul>
<p style="color: black;padding-left: 60px">If you are planning to be part of this highly agile, dynamic, and engaging career, then you may want to focus on some of the skills described here:</p>
<ul>
<li style="padding-left: 60px">First and foremost, it is important to become a quick learner with keen observations skills, attention to detail, and the ability to follow proper processes as defined by the organization.</li>
<li style="padding-left: 60px">Unlike other areas of security, for this one, you also need to possess a strong understanding of operating system concepts.</li>
<li style="padding-left: 60px">Learn a few low-level languages, such as an assembly language. You can start with the basics first rather than trying to be an expert to start with in this field. You will gain expertise over a period of time.</li>
<li style="padding-left: 60px">Acquire skills around Perl, Python, Shell, PowerShell, Bash, Java, and other scripting languages.</li>
<li style="padding-left: 60px">Learn application security and network security concepts.</li>
<li style="padding-left: 60px">Learn how to use tools such as OllyDbg, WinDbg, IDAPro, process monitor, process explorer, Wireshark, PEID, PE Explorer, and other commercial, as well as open source, tools related to reverse engineering.</li>
<li style="padding-left: 60px">Learn about malware, viruses, Trojans, APTs, and their working principles.</li>
<li style="padding-left: 60px">Learn how to identify vulnerabilities and exploit tactics.</li>
<li style="padding-left: 60px">Learn PE file formatting and about analyzing files after unpacking them.</li>
<li style="color: black"><strong>Digital forensics</strong> (<strong>DF</strong>) is a very interesting and engaging stream of cybersecurity; if you are planning to get started in digital forensics, then I am sure you will not be disappointed. Digital forensics is based on recovering lost data, investigations, and the collection of evidence and materials found on digital devices. DF is done in most cases where computer crime is involved, and you must prove a crime or theft. DF can be done on any computer assets, such as workstations, servers, mobile devices, and network devices. You need to be extremely careful while performing DF, as you not only have to find evidence but must also ensure its safekeeping, integrity, and sensitiveness, as this evidence may be used in a court of law by the appropriate body or legal team. The current industry standard is to have dedicated digital forensics team or analysts. During DF, proper instructions or orders are followed to acquire evidence from a machine or from the cloud. If you are planning to be a forensic investigator in the digital world, one of the skills that you have to focus on is the process of transferring and preserving artifacts after you have collected them. It's very important to maintain a chain of custody to ensure that evidence is not tampered with; otherwise, it will prove no use in a court of law. Some of the skill sets that you can bank upon to become a digital forensic investigator are listed here:</li>
<li style="padding-left: 60px">Learn how to imagine the target system, as it will allow you to analyze it without impacting the original digital media under investigation</li>
<li style="padding-left: 60px">Cryptography and encryption technology skills will certainly add value to digital forensics, as often you will find that data is encrypted and you may have to decrypt it for your investigation</li>
<li style="padding-left: 60px">Finding and recovering deleted files</li>
<li style="padding-left: 60px">Knowledge of a file's metadata and how to extract that information for investigation</li>
<li style="padding-left: 60px">A keen understanding of international as well as local cybercrime and criminal laws, especially for the region you are going to work in, because every country has its own specific laws, on top of international laws</li>
<li style="padding-left: 60px">In-depth knowledge of cybersecurity and attack methodologies will always be key to your investigation and your analysis</li>
<li style="padding-left: 60px">A very good understanding of operating systems and networking technologies</li>
<li style="padding-left: 60px">Attention to detail and presentation skills</li>
<li style="padding-left: 60px">Knowledge of forensic tools and software such as EnCase, FTK, Cellebrite, and Volatility</li>
<li style="padding-left: 60px">Knowledge of virtualization technologies will also come in handy</li>

<p><strong>Getting a foot on the cybersecurity ladder</strong></p>
<p>Twenty years ago, if you said you wanted to work in security, you would be issued with a walkie-talkie, a hat, and your own shopping mall to patrol. If you had said you wanted to work in cybersecurity, you probably would have received a nice smile and a change of subject.  Times have very much changed since then; those tasked with working security <q>“front of house”</q> in those shopping malls are invisibly supported by those working in cybersecurity <q>“back of house”</q>. This ensures that the shops and services are as protected from the casual shoplifter as they are to the professional cybercriminal. The infamous case of the retailer Target being hacked in 2013 resulted in a reported loss of $148 million, and nothing compared to the damage it did to their reputation.</p>
<p>Imagine if it were your job that just cost your employer $148 million. I assume Target quickly re-evaluated its cyber security workforce, polices, and processes after this. A quick check of LinkedIn reveals that Target's Senior Vice President of Information Security joined them shortly after this incident (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rich-agostino/">https://www.linkedin.com/in/rich-agostino/</a>).</p>
<p>You tend not to see too many Senior Vice President roles in the 'situations vacant' section of your local newspaper.  However, that sort of role sits at the top of a huge pyramid of opportunities for those with a passion for cybersecurity.</p>
<p><strong>The elephant in the room</strong></p>
<p>If you are reading this book, you are likely interested in getting started with cybersecurity. However, maybe you are feeling insecure about your aptitude or your ability. Perhaps you think you need to be a propeller head mathematical genius with a passion for <em>Star Trek</em> to succeed. Of course, all of those attributes help, but many of the technical and compliancy skills can be learnt. Perhaps the question to ask to yourself is not <em>do I have or can I get the skills I need?</em> but <em>do I have the aptitude?</em></p>
<p>Ask yourself: am I able to think like a potential hacker; do I understand social engineering? Could I throw my aptitude and skills in front of a speeding train filled with professional and amateur hackers driven to deface a public website or empty bank accounts? By doing this, can I also help colleagues to not fall for phishing attacks that let the website be defaced or the bank accounts be emptied? The picture I am painting is one of a need for an individual with both technical ability, street smarts, agility, change management and even business analytical competencies.  The elephant in the room? There is no <em>one</em> path to enlightenment. Doing a Certified Hacker Course will not alone give you super powers. Plan bigger<em>.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hacking is easy</strong></p>
<p>We have all seen it on TV or the movies: the super villain hacker - with their banks of equipment, flashing lights, and network cables - plugs in a USB stick. Some command windows open and random technical words appear, alongside a  progress bar.  Meanwhile, inside the organization being hacked, the victims turn to the aforementioned propeller head, he or she slips on their tank top of choice, and opens a laptop that is immediately available for action… There is probably a map on the screen, with various sections of it turning red as the hacker progresses. Cut to a shot of the progress bar: back to the white knight, the defensive hacker. They randomly mash the keyboard until the map is back to green. The nuclear weapon is disarmed, the list of British agents in the field deleted, or the personal details of 5 million customers of a 5th Avenue New York retailer - attached by cybercrime syndicate Fin7 - are no longer at risk. Unfortunately, in the case of Target, 5 million people had to be contacted and advised their details were out there (<a href="https://mashable.com/2018/04/04/every-store-retailer-hacked/#T_rdfTf4fPqT">https://mashable.com/2018/04/04/every-store-retailer-hacked/#T_rdfTf4fPqT</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Still want to work in cybersecurity?</strong></p>
<p>Working for DDLS, Australia's largest provider of technical training, provides me with some fantastic insights into what corporate Australia is training its workforce for. You will not be surprised to learn that courses such as EC Councils Certified Ethical hacker are top sellers. We will come back to talk about specific courses and certifications shortly. </p>
<p>Who knows what the demographics of the readers of this book will be? From the mentoring work I have done with Australian children's charity, The Smith Family, I know that preparing for a career should start early. If you are reading this as and still at school, or maybe a parent thinking about how you can support your son or daughter's journey after they finish school, go and speak with your local universities and colleges about your aspirations. They have worked out that there is a huge need for cybersecurity skills, and money to be made, and they will potentially have diplomas and degrees in cybersecurity available for you to join. Universities across the world already offer a Master of Science in Cybersecurity.</p>
<p><strong>Roles within roles</strong></p>
<p>There is no one size fits all job title, no one set of skills, and I would argue, not one skill set that makes up a cybersecurity job. A quick look at Seek, a popular employment website in Australia, revealed 15 different security job titles on the first few pages. <strong>Analyst</strong> and <strong>Specialist</strong> being particularly popular. These roles require skills such as <q>“delivering defensive cyber security services across the bank and providing security insights and expertise using the latest security technologies."</q>  So that's pretty clear: change the locks and the job is done.  The criteria for a Cybersecurity Analyst for a government department suggested that <q>“this job requires you to identify and asses key cyber security threats and trends. Tell us about a time you have identified an issue."</q></p>
<p>I am not filled with confidence that roles recruited on the above criteria will be disarming those nuclear weapons any time soon.</p>
<p>What I do see are two streams of cybersecurity opportunities. I will describe them as <strong>hands on</strong> and <strong>hands off</strong></p>
<p>In the hands on stream, I see cybersecurity not just being limited to cybersecurity products, but as the very fabric on which every organization builds its technology. DDLS is a training partner with Microsoft, Google Cloud, AWS, and Red Hat; all of these vendors build fantastic, secure products, which someone has to design, deploy, and manage securely. The point here is that cybersecurity isn't separate from business. It is business as usual.</p>
<p>An Azure administrator will have a level of responsibility for delivering secure cloud services to their business.  It is way beyond the scope of this section to dive into developing secure code, but clearly no one wants an application that is easy to compromise. Of course, that hands on stream includes security appliances such as Checkpoint, end point security such as Trend, and network security built into Cisco products. Only after we have thought about the proper opportunity to manage security can we start to think about the more generic cybersecurity training, such as the Ethical hacker programs from EC Council.</p>
<p>I have just mentioned a hands off stream, and these are roles less wrapped up in curly brackets. For example, an Incident Manager is the one after whom the company runs when the company database hits the internet. I see these roles as ones not engaging in the technical aspects of implementing cybersecurity. Consider them as an analyst role, perhaps tasked with analyzing and assessing vulnerabilities in the infrastructure. This investigates tools and countermeasures to remedy the detected vulnerabilities, and recommends solutions and best practices. They also test for compliance with security policies and procedures. The infrastructure in this example includes software, hardware, networks, and people. Therefore, it is easy to see that it would be hard to have domain level expertise across every discipline.  You would need the support of someone with hands on skills in Cisco or AWS. Hopefully it's clear that providing a prescriptive view of who is who in the cybersecurity zoo isn't possible. Therefore, here is some homework for you: use tools such as LinkedIn and job seeking websites of choice and check out roles such as Security Analyst, Security Engineer, Security Architect, Security Software Developer, Chief Information Security officer, Security Specialist, Penetration Tester, Forensic Investigator, Disaster Recovery Analyst, and so on.</p>
<p>Top tip: If you are not currently working in cybersecurity, research your role before you invest in training, as each role has a different path of training required to master it.</p>
<p>Getting the skills you need to be recognized as a cybersecurity expert is a minefield. If you just want to manage a secure hybrid cloud environment, a Masters in cybersecurity is nice, but it won't help you with your day to day job. You actually would be better placed looking at the vendor certifications for AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, or your Cloud platform of choice. Following this advice will save you four years and about $70,000 of student debt.  </p>
<p>The example above illustrates an interesting perspective. In a secure world there are training courses and certifications that are mapped to a product. A Checkpoint Security certification is really valuable if you support Checkpoint devices; the same rules apply to cloud platforms and networking hardware. You can bet on Cisco as it's very dominate, but if your dream job is for an organization that has built its networking on top of Huawei hardware, Cisco skills are suddenly less relevant . However, they are still usable and concepts tend not to change, just the way the technology deals with it does. There are of course other training courses and certifications that are not vendor-specific. These courses tend to be more portable. The concept of what a denial of service attack is is the same irrespective of your choices of IT vendor.</p>
<p>It would be wrong for me to prescriptively list the courses YOU must take to become a security professional, simply because I don't know what type of security professional you want to be, or will end up being. I can, however, share with you some of the market leaders in this space. Being armed with aligned skills from some of these vendors will help you get a secure foot on the ladder, help you take the next step in your career, or more importantly, help your employer sleep better at night, safe in the knowledge you are one step ahead of the hackers, probably.</p>
<p><strong>Start here</strong></p>
<p>If you are still in education, consider checking out what is on offer at local universities and colleges. Talk to them about what roles students who have completed the courses have gone on to achieve.</p>
<p>If you are not currently working in IT, or perhaps are a first line support and looking for a broad baptism of cybersecurity knowledge, have a look at courses in security from CompTIA. Their Security+ certification <q>“validates the baseline skills you need to perform core security functions and pursue an IT security career.”</q> This is an ideal starting point.</p>
<p>See yourself as an IT person securely managing complex infrastructures? Check out the vendor certifications for your platform of choice. Currently there are lots to choose from, from the Cisco CCNA Security to Architect level certifications from vendors.</p>
<p>Navigating the options is a consultative exercise in itself. Working with a learning partner, such as DDLS in Australia, can help you navigate the courses and certifications, to get you market specific data—if CompTIA is not a thing in your market, do not take it.</p>
<p>Already have a background in IT and looking to focus on security?</p>
<p>There are three vendors that immediately spring to mind: EC Council, ISC2 and ISACA. There are others too, and all have their fans and their haters. Part of the guidance I would love for you to take from this piece is it's not just about finding the right content from an intellectual perspective, but also from a geographic or organizational perspective. At the time of writing, here in Australia, a quick review of CEH, CISSP, and CISM cybersecurity jobs revealed a similar number of vacancies. There are around 50 more jobs with CISSP as a desirable certification; more than CISM and 70 more than CEH. The level playing field is slightly titled towards CISSP.</p>
<p>Clearly cybersecurity involves a lot of acronyms, including CEH, CISSP, ISACA, and ISC2. But what do all of these mean?  Let's just try and make sense of this:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>CEH – Certified Ethical Hacker</strong>: A very well regarded certification, this is an intermediate-level credential, part of a suite from EC Council. It is well suited to those at the start of their move from IT into cybersecurity; expected experience is lower than that of CISM or CISSP. Quoting the vendor, CEH credential holders possess skills and knowledge on hacking practices in areas such as footprinting and reconnaissance, scanning networks, enumeration, system hacking, Trojans, worms and viruses, sniffers, denial-of-service attacks, social engineering, session hijacking, hacking web servers, wireless networks and web applications, SQL injection, cryptography, penetration testing, evading IDS, firewalls, and honeypots. CEH is a vendor neutral certification.</li>
<li><strong>CISM – Certified Information Security Manager</strong>: This is also well regarded. It is an advanced level certification, part of a suite from ISACA. ISACA are focused on governance. CISM requires at least 5 years experience so it's not suited to those wanting to move to a career in cybersecurity. Credential holders possess advanced and proven skills in security risk management, program development and management, governance, incident management, and response.</li>
<li><strong>CISSP - Certified Information Systems Security Professional:</strong> In my market, this is curently the most in-demand certification. It is an advanced level certification, which again assumes around 5 years of experience. CISSP is part of a suite of courses from ISC2 (pronounced <em>ISC squared</em>). To quote the vendor, CISSP credential holders are decision-makers who possess expert knowledge and technical skills necessary to develop, guide and then manage security standards, policies, and procedures within their organizations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Many cybersecurity credentials require the renewal of certifications to stay current. This is not a huge surprise as hackers learn new vulnerabilities, and therefore those tasked with staying one step ahead must evolve their skills.</p>
<p><strong>So what did you just tell me?</strong></p>
<p>Cybersecurity is a very rewarding career, both financially and intellectually. There are multiple entry points. Brand new to cybersecurity? Look at CompTIA. Working in 2nd or third line support? Look at Certified Ethical Hacker. Love governance and auditing? Research ISACA. Ready to be the decision maker in your business? Look at CISSP. All of the vendors mentioned have credible, high quality solutions and operate with integrity. Working with a local learning partner is a sure fire way to get something relevant based on your needs, current background and market conditions. All of these vendors have a suite of security offerings, some of which compete. As you move up the career ladder, your training options evolve, but that is a story for the next book.</p>
<p><strong>Who is</strong> <strong>Gary Duffield?</strong></p>
<p>The day that I realized that learning and development has the power to change lives was the day I was dismissed from McDonalds, 18 and unqualified. Studying to become a Television Engineer helped me fall in love with learning. Television engineers became micro computer engineers; PC engineers became trainers. The die was cast, I was a Learning and Development Professional.</p>
<p>In 2009 I decided I wanted to disrupt my life. I wanted to leave my perfect job of 25 years at QA Training, one of the world's largest training businesses, and move to Australia. My wife, not keen on the idea, set the rules. It had to be Perth. The Australian government set the rule: get in before I was over 45 or the door slammed shut.</p>
<p>I formulated a plan, I did a degree at Manchester Met to help with the visa (it didn't), I asked key vendors who I should work for. They had one name: DDLS. I spent a year trying to contact them, stalking them at global conferences, building relationships with their staff, suppliers and clients.</p>
<p>I had moved - albeit on a temporary visa - to Australia, and I made a real mess of it. I was selling nothing. As a result, I had one of <em>those</em> conversations with the boss. I realized my approach was wrong. I realized I knew vendor land. I'm forever grateful to Alan Watts of Microsoft and Sally Adams at Data3. Both took the time to help this pom integrate. I didn't look back. 14 months in sales, and they let a Manchester lad in Perth lead the Microsoft business. A year later I joined the senior leadership team.</p>
<p>Right now, I'm helping lead DDLS through a digital disruption as we on-board new vendors, forge new partnerships and seek to better service the needs of our clients.</p>
<p>I actively mentor under-privileged children for The Smith Family and am a passionate advocate of Women in IT and Leadership. I am after all, a dad with a daughter, who is now a passionate Australian. Without learning and certification, where would I be?</p>

<p><strong><em>Cybersecurity: The Beginner's Guide—</em>a comprehensive guide to getting started in cybersecurity.</strong></p>
<p style="color: black">I am so used to hearing questions such as the following:</p>
<p>"How can I start my career in cybersecurity?"</p>
<p>"How can I switch to cyber?"</p>
<p>"What are your recommendations for us to be successful?"</p>
<p style="color: black">If not every day, it must be at least a few times every week that, those questions are asked of me. Regardless of whether I am in Australia, Asia, Africa, America—you name it—I receive the same questions again and again. I wrote a few blog posts about the topic on LinkedIn and <a href="https://www.erdalozkaya.com/">https://www.erdalozkaya.com/</a>, but they are not detailed enough to help beginners or career-switchers as they don't provide in-depth help.</p>
<p style="color: black">It's not a secret; everyone is talking about the huge talent gap in the cybersecurity industry: <em>Forbes Magazine</em>, <em>Tech Republic</em>, <em>CSO Online</em>, <em>DarkReading</em>, <em>SC Magazine</em>, and others, as well as, Fortune CEOs such as Satya Nadella, McAfee's CEO Chris Young, Cisco's CIO Colin Seward, and others.</p>
<p style="color: black">Organizations such as ISSA and research firms such as Gartner are also discussing this. So, nearly everyone is talking about this topic.</p>
<p style="color: black">Working closely with Microsoft's Cybersecurity Solution Group's Corporate Vice President Ann Johnson, knowing her passion for working closely with cybersecurity talent and closing the diversity gap has always encouraged me. With her tweets and her talks, in our one-to-ones and through her public speeches, she has influenced me to do more in this area.</p>
<p style="color: black">And, finally, while I was delivering a cybersecurity workshop in India for a group of IT experts, when I received similar questions on how they could become experts specifically in cybersecurity and AI, I noticed it was time to do something; while chatting to Deepayan, who was also an instructor at the same workshop, he shared with me his experience on the same topic.</p>
<p style="color: black">There are possibly endless resources and information already available on the internet today, which talk about how to start in a particular area of cybersecurity. Even so, if many people are reaching out to people in the industry with the same questions and seeking basic guidance to kickstart a career in security, then it must be a general problem and could be a very simple one to solve. After analyzing the case, I found out that the information available on the internet is either overwhelming for someone to process or is too fragmented, so individuals are unable to see the forest view of the cybersecurity world and then pick a tree for themselves.</p>
<p style="color: black">With the final push being the course attendees and Deepayan, I decided to reach out to Heramb, the <strong>Acquisition Editor</strong> (<strong>AE</strong>) from Packt Publishing and shared my idea. And, of course, Packt was also aware of the same issue.</p>
<p style="color: black">And finally, here is the book; after completing it, we reached out to some close friends who have spent years in cybersecurity, and we asked them to share their experience with <em>you</em>, our readers, as well.</p>
<p style="color: black">I hope it will help many individuals and organizations.</p>

<p style="color: black"><strong>How did I become involved in information security?</strong></p>
<p style="color: black">My first hack (!) happened when I was 9 years old. My brother received a James Bond-style three-digit manual bag as a birthday gift. He used to hide his secret stuff inside the bag, and one day I realized he had something really interesting in his bag, and I wanted to get access to it. Of course, my brother was not that keen on me having access to his bag. So, to cut a long story short, after running a manual password attack, which, of course, took me a while since I had to write every single combination down, within weeks I was able to open his bag. My reward was his magazines; as a nine-year-old boy, having access to those kinds of magazines made me the most popular boy in my primary school.</p>
<p style="color: black">Starting my career as a network administrator, then moving on to infrastructure engineering with every project I completed, the security gaps that I have found have always frustrated me, researching every single issue that I have faced, reading many staff comments on the net, and doing many hands-on exercises. Then, moving on to IT consulting and sharing my insight with my clients from all organizations showed me the biggest gaps in IT departments. So, I decided to move toward information security and build my skills and knowledge in the field to be able to pass them on to everyone else around me.</p>
<p style="color: black">A very long time ago, when I was still a teenager in Germany, I used to work part-time in a small computer shop where I had to teach customers how to fix minor issues. Back in those days, computers were not in every house, and I used to teach friends how to operate them. Then, in university, I completed a teaching degree as my secondary degree.</p>
<p style="color: black">When I moved to Australia, I started a part-time side-business from my garage, selling computers and providing networking, implementation, and security services. In the meantime, I was still studying network engineering and getting Microsoft certifications.</p>
<p style="color: black">My MCT training career started in 2002; I got multiple MCP/MCSE certifications, and there was a huge IT boom. I became extremely busy, running between training centers as a part-time tutor, teaching many Microsoft and security courses. That led to me opening my own training company, where I had only one room, and at the same time I was still working somewhere else as a full-time IT professional. Finally, in 2006, I quit my full-time job and started to work for myself, where I grew the business into a multi-branch training company. Within a few years, the business grew from a one-room training center to a multi-million dollar business with branches all across Australia.</p>

<p style="color: black">In 2012, the success of my company gained the attention of another company, who offered me a deal to buy the business, which I could not resist. The handover of the business took a year; in that time, I continued to deliver security assessments and security/ethical hacking classes:</p>

<p style="color: black">In the meantime, I was still working toward my goals and dreams of <em>"making</em> <em>cyberspace more secure;</em><em>"</em> my contributions caught the attention of Microsoft and I was given the Microsoft Most Valuable Professional award (I was awarded an MVP from 2008 until I joined Microsoft in January 2016):</p>

<p>Microsoft Most Valuable Award letter from the Corporate Vice President</p>
<p style="color: black">In the meantime, I have also finished a Bachelor of IT degree at the University of Western Sydney, and have spoken at many conferences as a Subject Matter Expert. In 2008, I was selected as Speaker of the Year at Microsoft TechEd (now, it's called Microsoft Ignite). I was also selected as Best Microsoft Certified Trainer in Australia, and I received the Global Instructor of the Year award by EC-Council for getting excellent feedback from my ethical hacking, forensics, and penetrating testing classes:</p>

<p style="color: black">This award helped me to speak at even bigger conferences with a few thousand attendees. The more time I invested in developing myself and sharing my experience with communities helped me meet many people, which gave me a lot of international exposure. This is what I tried to explain to you in <a href="c70739a3-6fd8-4aa0-a27a-f3c7e16b531c.xhtml">Chapter 7</a>, <em>Networking, Mentoring, and Shadowing</em>.

<p>"I first met Erdal back in 2012 when he was Chief Technology Officer for an IT infrastructure design company called Fastlane. Erdal's enthusiasm and vitality was infectious, and I couldn't help but suggest he channel it into postgraduate study. Erdal soon went on to enrol on one of our cybersecurity master's degrees, later taught some of the subjects, published several best-selling books on cybersecurity and just last year graduated from our Doctor of IT. Today, Erdal travels the world, helping companies that have been hacked and companies who are about to be hacked."</p>

<p style="color: black">When I started to do my master's, I also got an offer from IT Masters and Charles Sturt University to share my experiences with their students. Since then, I have been lecturing at Charles Sturt University:</p>

<p style="color: black">In 2013, I joined Kemp Technologies as a regional director for 2 years. I helped Kemp to grow its business in Australia and Asia. While at Kemp, I was still part of the community, and any free time that I could find I invested in building cyber-aware campaigns to raise the security bar against hackers:</p>

<p style="color: black">My full-time work never held me back from working toward my dreams. My hard work also grabbed the attention of newspapers. The following are some screenshots from those news articles:</p>

<p style="color: black">Then, I had a great offer from EMT Holdings. The company offered me the Regional CISO position for the Middle East and Africa and a Vice President status, based in Dubai:</p>

<p style="color: black">Dubai, United Arab Emirates was a brand new market for me; yes, I was born in Germany, and I have also lived in Turkey, then Australia, traveling around Asia, but none of those places can be compared to the Middle East. I had to start from the beginning, as I didn't know too many people, so I followed all the recommendations that I have made to you.</p>
<p style="color: black">Me and my family moved to Dubai in December 2014, and within a year I came second in the Top 50 Security Professionals by <em>Channel MEA</em> magazine for my contribution to helping the community to be cyber-aware:</p>

<p style="color: black">I started from scratch and just repeated what I knew was going to work, and it did. Events started to catch the attention of the journalists all across that region. The following is an example from a newspaper in Bahrain:</p>

<p style="color: black">This caught the attention of Microsoft, and I found myself joining Microsoft as a cybersecurity architect responsible for Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. For 3 and a half years, I reached out to customers all around the world.</p>
<p style="color: black">Not just with our customers, but internally I was also volunteering to deliver advanced cybersecurity classes, as well as cyber classes for CxP levels. I was awarded membership of the Platinum Club, which is the highest level of achievement in Microsoft that an employee can achieve:</p>

<p style="color: black">All of this never killed my desire to learn; in 2018, I was able to finish my doctorate degree remotely from the Charles Sturt University in Australia:</p>

<p style="color: black">I loved my work at Microsoft, but I was traveling way too much, and at the beginning of 2019, I decided to move to another great global company, the Standard Chartered bank, as Head of Information and Cybersecurity (Managing Director).</p>
<p style="color: black"><strong>What advice would you give to someone who is considering a career in IT? How can they get started</strong>?</p>
<p style="color: black">As I've explained throughout this book, anybody who sees themselves in IT has to keep one thing in mind: the learning curve will never, ever end, so you have to love learning, researching, and being up to date. The IT industry will not appreciate the past; being current and being ready for tomorrow with the experience from the past is the best piece of advice I can give you.</p>
<p style="color: black">Technology is moving so quickly, and it is it difficult to stay up to date, so if you don't like to read and learn, your knowledge will become outdated very quickly. We are in an era where knowledge can be gained much easier than 20 years ago; back then, for us to be able to learn, we had to go to libraries, borrow books (if we were lucky, as not too many IT books are in libraries), but, today, blogs, computer-based training, YouTube, and classroom-based training is much easier to reach and much more affordable. So, to keep it short, even if you cannot attend conferences, today, most of them are broadcast live, so watch them; follow technology leaders on Twitter; subscribe to a couple of valuable email lists; and read, learn, and, of course, practice.</p>
<p style="color: black">Looking back at my career, from a small business owner to a multi-million dollar company, then moving to Kemp Technologies, Secunia (EMT Holdings), and Microsoft, I have worked with many governments and Fortune 100 companies in the financial and medical sectors:</p>

<p style="color: black">Selling hardware and implementing services can be repetitive, but being a Trusted Security Advisor working with Tier-1 Security issues can be unique. You might visit an organization that has 30,000 computers wiped out. Being able to work with customers in bad times is very special. Being able to help them resume services as soon as possible is indescribable for me.</p>

<p style="color: black">At the same time, when I teach workshops or when I speak at conferences, sharing the real-life experience that have I gained in the field, helping students/attendees to be better makes me happy, and seeing my customers being able to fight sophisticated attacks makes me proud. Reading feedback via email—or you name it—makes me feel the best; mission accomplished—until the next challenge, which could be in the next hour.</p>
<p style="color: black"><strong>Get feedback, listen to feedback, and keep improving yourself</strong></p>
<p style="color: black">Being awarded a doctorate in your career after two master's and two university degrees might sound like the pinnacle, but it isn't. I know I am still as I was on the first day of my career. My biggest mission is to make cyberspace more secure for everyone. Having a doctorate or working in a C-level job has no direct impact on my mission. I will probably still take the time to write books, speak at free events and webinars, as well as Tier-1 conferences, in order to share my experiences, findings, and recommendations with as many people as I can. Knowing humans, and how vulnerable we are, having the mission of helping to make every person and every organization more aware of cyber threats is not an easy task.</p>
<p style="color: black">As my final word, I would like to share my speech from my doctorate graduation with you. If I can do it, so can you, and please don't forget that the highlight of my career happened in my late 20s, when I was married and had children:</p>
<p>"I had a dream, a dream that was not easy to reach; I <strong>plan</strong>ned.<br/>
I had to take the necessary steps to achieve my goal; I <strong>act</strong>ed.<br/>
There were times when I felt alone, when I thought I would never go through with it; I had some negative feedback that I needed to address; there were times when I fell.<br/>
I learned from all those to move forward, <strong>learn</strong>ed from my mistakes.<br/>
Finally, in the end, I am a doctor; <strong>I made it</strong>.<br/>
Today, when I look back, I know nothing happens without <strong>dream</strong>ing, without taking the first step, without checking your progress and learning from your mistakes."</p>
<p style="color: black">Today, from my speech, if you wanted to walk away with one thought, I would say <em>"never give up,"</em> regardless of how tired you are or how many times you fail<strong><em>.</em> <em>Stic</em><em>k</em> <em>to</em> <em>yo</em><em>ur</em> <em>a</em><em>mbition,</em> <em>t</em><em>o</em> <em>y</em><em>our</em> <em>go</em><em>als,</em> <em>a</em><em>nd</em> <em>A</em><em>CHIEVE</em> <em>them</em>. I know you can, because I just did it</strong>, and I just shared my <em>"secret recipe."</em></p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
