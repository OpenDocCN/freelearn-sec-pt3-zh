    <h1 id="_idParaDest-234" class="chapterTitle">Networking Basics</h1>
    <p class="normal">Very rarely in your career will you have to investigate a single computer that has not connected to a network. When I say “computer,” this includes mobile devices. Desktops, laptops, and mobile devices are designed to share information through a network we refer to as the “Internet.” There are legitimate uses for such devices as well as illegitimate uses. For example, users of these devices have been known to record audio and video of themselves committing criminal acts. These same users will also use the Internet to research activities they plan on executing in the future; these activities will include criminal acts.</p>
    <p class="normal">There may also come a time when you are called to investigate a crime where a device has been the target of a crime: a server may have been hacked, a user’s mobile device may have been compromised, or a user’s online storage may have been compromised. These acts require you to understand how devices communicate on the network. This chapter will discuss some of the essential information you need to understand about networks, from theoretical concepts right through to network topology, addressing, and some basic protocols, to increase your networking knowledge. I recommend that you study for the CompTIA Network+ exam and the Security+ exam.</p>
    <p class="normal">We will cover the following topics in this chapter:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList">The OSI and DOD models</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Network hardware</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Common ports and protocols</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">A network is built on a set of standards and models. If the clients on the network do not adhere to a set standard, there will be a lack of communication. This ensures that all clients on the network can communicate with each other. </p>
    <p class="normal">The primary reference model used for the configuration of networks is the <strong class="keyWord">Open Source Interconnection</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">OSI</strong>) model. Developers use the OSI model to break communication into different layers; each layer has a specific role to play in how data is transmitted and received. (If you wish to read about the OSI standard in much greater detail, you can go to <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/20269.html">https://www.iso.org/standard/20269.html</a>.)</p>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-235" class="heading-1">The Open Source Interconnection (OSI) model</h1>
    <p class="normal">This <a id="_idIndexMarker1001"/>reference model is just a reference for developers to utilize while they create the protocols and devices that users will use to connect to the network. This layered model <a id="_idIndexMarker1002"/>has some advantages, such as these:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList">The communication process comprises components that allow for easier development and troubleshooting</li>
      <li class="bulletList">By following standards, different types of equipment and software can communicate with each other</li>
      <li class="bulletList">A change in one layer does not affect other layers</li>
      <li class="bulletList">The standardization of the components allows multiple organizations to develop and deploy components</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">By using the<a id="_idIndexMarker1003"/> OSI model, you can have hosts from Microsoft, Apple, UNIX, and Linux connected and communicating to the same network. As shown in <em class="italic">Figure 11.1</em>, you can see that the OSI model is made up of seven different layers. The layers are as follows:</p>

    <div><p class="normal">You can use a mnemonic to remember the order from layer 1 to layer 7, such as “Please do not throw sausage pizza away.” From layer 7 to layer 1, use the mnemonic “All people seem to need data processing.”</p>

    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 11.2: OSI model – layer functions</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-236" class="heading-2">Physical (Layer 1)</h2>
    <p class="normal">The <a id="_idIndexMarker1004"/>physical layer (Layer 1) is<a id="_idIndexMarker1005"/> responsible for creating the path between the different hosts on the network. This can be the physical topology for the transmission of the data. The physical topology consists of an Ethernet network, where Ethernet cables are connected to the hosts and network devices; an example of data transmission could be a Wi-Fi network where data is transmitted via radio signal and not a physical medium. This layer takes responsibility for transmitting data and receiving data. Also controlled at this layer are the specifications for the physical medium and the connections used between the host and the physical/transmission medium.</p>
    <p class="normal">Some of the devices that you may encounter at this layer include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList">Repeaters – electronic devices that receive and re-transmit data</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Hubs – networking devices used to connect multiple hosts and network devices</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Modems – networking <a id="_idIndexMarker1006"/>devices used to <a id="_idIndexMarker1007"/>encode and decode signals containing network data</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-237" class="heading-2">Data link (Layer 2)</h2>
    <p class="normal">The data link layer (Layer 2) is<a id="_idIndexMarker1008"/> responsible <a id="_idIndexMarker1009"/>for data transfer. It provides for flow control, error notification, and network topology requirements between hosts and network devices connected to the same logical segment of the network. In addition, this layer is responsible for delivering data to the correct destination. This is done by using a physical address of the network interface device, which is also known as the MAC (Media Access Control) address. The data link layer contains two sub-layers:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList">Logical Link Control (LLC) – responsible for identifying network-layer protocols</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Media Access Control (MAC) – responsible for the placement of the packets and physical addressing</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">At this layer, the data is formatted into frames.</p>
    <p class="normal">Some of the devices you may encounter at this layer include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList">Network adapters – allow host(s) to connect to the network medium</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Bridge – a networking device used to connect two network segments</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Wireless access point – a networking device that is used to create a bridge between a wired and wireless network</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-238" class="heading-2">Network (Layer 3)</h2>
    <p class="normal">The network layer (Layer 3) is <a id="_idIndexMarker1010"/>responsible <a id="_idIndexMarker1011"/>for the logical addressing of the hosts and network devices, determining the best route for data transmission, and mapping the locations of all the devices connected to the network. The logical addressing used at this layer will depend on the network. The most common address you may be familiar with is the IP address assigned to your local host. There are currently two different versions of IP addressing available: IPv4 and IPv6. At this layer, the data is formatted into packets.</p>
    <p class="normal">Some devices <a id="_idIndexMarker1012"/>you may encounter at this layer include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList">Routers – a network device responsible for the routing of data based on logical addressing (IP address)</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Switch – a network device<a id="_idIndexMarker1013"/> that can forward data based on logical addressing (typically, switches are considered to be a Layer 2 device, but some do have the functionality to work at the network layer)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-239" class="heading-2">Transport (Layer 4)</h2>
    <p class="normal">The transport layer (Layer 4) is <a id="_idIndexMarker1014"/>responsible<a id="_idIndexMarker1015"/> for reliable data delivery, including establishing/closing virtual connections such as an HTTP connection between a host and a server. Multiplexing data streams are also addressed at this layer. The use of port numbers and network applications is a Layer 4 function; an example of this is web traffic being directed to port 80(HTTP) while email traffic is directed to port 25 (SMTP). At this layer, the data is formatted into segments.</p>
    <p class="normal">Some devices you may encounter at this layer include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList">Gateway – a network device that is responsible for connecting two networks that are using different protocols. The gateway will act as a translator between two dissimilar networks.</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Firewall – a networking device that is used to prevent unauthorized access to resources on the network.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-240" class="heading-2">Session (Layer 5)</h2>
    <p class="normal">The<a id="_idIndexMarker1016"/> session layer (Layer 5) is<a id="_idIndexMarker1017"/> responsible for creating, maintaining, and closing data sessions between hosts using presentation layer protocols. This layer will utilize the following modes to coordinate the data streams between hosts/servers on the network:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList">Simplex – data can only be transmitted in one direction</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Half duplex – data can be transmitted in both directions, but only in one direction at a time</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Full duplex – data can be transmitted in both directions at the same time</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-241" class="heading-2">Presentation (Layer 6)</h2>
    <p class="normal">The<a id="_idIndexMarker1018"/> presentation layer (Layer 6) is <a id="_idIndexMarker1019"/>responsible for presenting data to applications and converting data from the format used by the application to the transmission format used by the network. This can include encoding schemes such as ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) and Unicode.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-242" class="heading-2">Application (Layer 7)</h2>
    <p class="normal">The <a id="_idIndexMarker1020"/>application layer (Layer 7) provides<a id="_idIndexMarker1021"/> an interface for software applications and hosts on a network. An example of this is the transfer of files between systems. This allows applications using different operating systems and file systems to communicate and provide services to the user.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-243" class="heading-2">Encapsulation</h2>
    <p class="normal">As <a id="_idIndexMarker1022"/>data traverses the different layers of the stack, each layer adds information that the corresponding layer at the destination will read. An example of this is shown in <em class="italic">Figure 11.3</em>. The host on the left is sending a request to the host on the right. As the data is transmitted and travels down the stack, each layer may add a “header” to the data, encapsulating the header and the data added by previous layers. When the data reaches the destination host, the data will now be de-encapsulated, like peeling the layers of an onion, until it reaches the destination. For example, if the request were an HTTP request, the application header would be added to the data. At the transport layer, a TCP header will be added, the network layer will add an IP header, while the data link layer will then create an Ethernet header turning the data into a frame. The frame would then be transmitted along the physical layer. At the destination, the process will be reversed, each layer opening and reading the information added by the corresponding layer.</p>

    <h1 id="_idParaDest-244" class="heading-1">TCP/IP</h1>
    <p class="normal">While the OSI model<a id="_idIndexMarker1023"/> is theoretical, TCP/IP is a practical implementation of a set of protocols that dominates the current networking environment. TCP/IP was created by<a id="_idIndexMarker1024"/> the <strong class="keyWord">United States Department of Defense</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">DoD</strong>) with the intention of creating a protocol that would ensure the integrity of communications in the event of a catastrophe. Therefore, the TCP/IP is also <a id="_idIndexMarker1025"/>referred to as the DoD model and is made up of the following four layers:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList">Application</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Transport</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Internet</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Link/network access</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">It can be mapped to the different OSI model layers as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 11.4</em>.</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B18329_11_04.png" alt="Diagram  Description automatically generated"/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 11.4: The TCP/IP model compared to the OSI model</p>
    <p class="normal">The link/network access layer<a id="_idIndexMarker1026"/> corresponds with the OSI model’s physical and data link layers. This layer defines how the networking device will connect to the network.</p>
    <p class="normal">The Internet layer corresponds with the network layer of the OSI model. This layer is responsible for the logical addressing and routing of the data.</p>
    <p class="normal">The transport layer corresponds with the transport layer of the OSI model. This layer is responsible for establishing connections between the source and destination.</p>
    <p class="normal">The application layer corresponds with the OSI model’s session, presentation, and application layers. This layer is responsible for administrating the data flow of the different applications on the system. Some of the services you may encounter include FTP and HTTP.</p>
    <p class="normal">TCP/IP is a suite of protocols used by the host and network devices when connected. The main protocols of TCP/IP include TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), IP (Internet Protocol), and UDP (User Datagram Protocol).</p>
    <p class="normal">TCP is a connection-orientated protocol, which means a connection between the host and server must be established before data can be sent/received. This is achieved through the use of the three-way handshake. When a host wants to communicate with the server, they will initiate the connection by sending an SYN packet to the server. If the server is available, it will respond with an SYN/ACK packet back to the host. The host will then respond with an ACK packet, and the connection can be established. This process is shown in <em class="italic">Figure 11.5</em>.</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B18329_11_05.png" alt="Diagram  Description automatically generated with medium confidence"/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 11.5: TCP three-way handshake</p>
    <p class="normal">TCP is a<a id="_idIndexMarker1027"/> transport layer protocol and is used for the accurate delivery of data. Each packet must be accounted for as data is sent from the source to the destination. If a packet gets lost in transmission, the destination will notify the source that the packet is missing and needs to be resent. As a result, TCP communication may experience delays and is not suitable as a communication channel where speed overrides the need for accuracy.</p>
    <p class="normal">UDP is a connectionless oriented protocol. Whereas TCP requires a three-way handshake before the communication channel can be initiated, UDP does not. Therefore, when using UDP as a communication channel, the source will never know if there is packet loss because the destination does not have the means to track which data packets are being sent. An example of this can be video streaming; if there is packet loss, the user may never notice because it does not affect the quality of the video.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-245" class="heading-2">IPv4</h2>
    <p class="normal">IP is <a id="_idIndexMarker1028"/>responsible<a id="_idIndexMarker1029"/> for the transmission and routing of data across a network. Currently, <strong class="keyWord">IP version 4</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">IPv4</strong>) is the predominant version of the protocol, but IPv6 is slowly coming out and being used by more and more organizations. IP is also responsible for the logical addressing used by hosts when connected to the network. IPv4 uses a 32-bit addressing scheme consisting of 4 octets separated by a period (<code class="inlineCode">.</code>). </p>
    <p class="normal">For example, <code class="inlineCode">8.8.8.8</code> is a valid IPv4 address. IP addresses are <a id="_idIndexMarker1030"/>assigned to a specific class. The class of the IP address will dictate how many hosts you can have on the network.</p>

    <p class="normal">Each class <a id="_idIndexMarker1031"/>also has a set of private IP addresses that can be used in an internal network but will not be able to send traffic through an external router. This range of IP addresses is to be used in a closed local network. You cannot communicate outside the local network using an IP address in these ranges.

    <p class="normal">A port<a id="_idIndexMarker1034"/> is a 16-bit number attached to an IP address in <a id="_idIndexMarker1035"/>computer networking. A port number is specified for each service (or protocol). The port number completes the data stream’s destination or origination network address. Some port numbers are reserved for specific services. Port numbers lower than 1024 are commonly referred <a id="_idIndexMarker1036"/>to as “well-known” port numbers. Port numbers<a id="_idIndexMarker1037"/> greater than 1024 are called ephemeral ports.

    <p class="normal">IPv6 was <a id="_idIndexMarker1039"/>created <a id="_idIndexMarker1040"/>to address the lack of available IP addresses when using IPv4. When IPv4 was developed, the designers could not imagine the interconnected world we now occupy in the 21st century. While IPv4 can provide more than 4 billion IP addresses, eventually, that will not be enough due to the increasing demand and availability of network devices. IPv6 is a 128-bit addressing <a id="_idIndexMarker1041"/>scheme and can provide each person on the planet with approximately 4,000 logical addresses. The designers of IPv6 anticipated the world of wireless connectivity between mobile <a id="_idIndexMarker1042"/>devices and the <strong class="keyWord">Internet of Things</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">IoT</strong>). IPv6 is slowly being deployed to devices connected to the network but is still not the primary addressing scheme in the consumer world. IPv6 is based on the hexadecimal numbering system and consists of eight <a id="_idIndexMarker1043"/>groups of four hexadecimal characters; a colon separates each group. </p>
    <p class="normal">Each group consists of four digits, with each digit representing four bits. Each segment can have a hexadecimal value of zero through FFFF. An example of an IPv6 address is shown in <em class="italic">Figure 11.7</em>.</p>

      <li class="bulletList">Global Unicast Address – this address is routable on the Internet (starts with 2001)</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Unique Local – used for internal networks, not routable on the Internet</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Link Local – not routable locally or on the Internet</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">IPv6 uses the following types of <a id="_idIndexMarker1046"/>addressing schemes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList">Unique Local Addresses – these <a id="_idIndexMarker1047"/>addresses are used for non-routing purposes. They are nearly globally unique, so it’s unlikely you’ll ever have one of them overlap with any other address. In addition, they designed unique local addresses to replace site-local addresses; this allows communication throughout a site while being routable to multiple local networks. The difference between link local and unique local is that you can route unique local within your organization or company.</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Multicast – packets <a id="_idIndexMarker1048"/>addressed to a multicast address are delivered to all interfaces identified by the multicast address. Sometimes people call them one-to-many addresses. Multicast addresses in IPv6 always start with FF.</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Anycast – like multicast addresses, an anycast address identifies multiple interfaces. An <a id="_idIndexMarker1049"/>anycast packet is delivered to only one address.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">IPv6 address can also be shortened. In IPv6, a group can consist of all zeros. You do not need to write all the zeros in the address in such a case. Instead, you can write one zero, which translates to four zeros in the group (as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 11.10</em>).</p>

    <p class="normal">The following are some protocols you may come across during your investigations. The protocols are sorted by layer in the TCP/IP suite.</p>
    <h3 id="_idParaDest-248" class="heading-3">Application layer protocols</h3>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">File Transfer Protocol (FTP) (TCP ports 20 and 21)</strong></p>
    <p class="normal">This <a id="_idIndexMarker1050"/>protocol allows the user to send <a id="_idIndexMarker1051"/>and <a id="_idIndexMarker1052"/>receive <a id="_idIndexMarker1053"/>files across an IP-based network. FTP is also a program. When FTP is used as a protocol, applications are used to initiate the FTP process; when used as a program, the user initiates the FTP process.</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Secure Shell (SSH) (TCP port 22)</strong></p>
    <p class="normal">This <a id="_idIndexMarker1054"/>protocol allows the creation of a<a id="_idIndexMarker1055"/> secure Telnet session between hosts on an IP-based network. Once an SSH connection has been made, the user can operate and issue commands as if they were physically present at the remote host. SSH uses encryption to create a secure tunnel between the source and destination hosts.</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Telnet (TCP port 23)</strong></p>
    <p class="normal">This<a id="_idIndexMarker1056"/> protocol connects to a remote <a id="_idIndexMarker1057"/>host, that is, a terminal. The user can then operate and issue commands as if they were physically present at the remote host. As a result, a Telnet connection is not secure and is vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attack.</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) (TCP port 25)</strong></p>
    <p class="normal">This <a id="_idIndexMarker1058"/>protocol is a<a id="_idIndexMarker1059"/> communication protocol for e-mail transmission. Mail servers use SMTP to send and receive mail.</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Domain Name Service (DNS) (TCP port 53, UDP port 53)</strong></p>
    <p class="normal">This<a id="_idIndexMarker1060"/> protocol is<a id="_idIndexMarker1061"/> used to resolve a hostname to an IP address. For example, it is much easier for a user to type <a href="https://www.packtpub.com">https://www.packtpub.com</a> than an IP address such as <code class="inlineCode">104.22.1.175</code>. </p>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) (UDP port 67)</strong></p>
    <p class="normal">This <a id="_idIndexMarker1062"/>protocol <a id="_idIndexMarker1063"/>automatically assigns an IP address when a host joins the network. This allows for the automatic administration of the network as hosts enter and leave the network. Some of the information that the DHCP server will provide includes the IP address, subnet mask, default gateway, and the IP address for the DNS server.</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) (TCP port 80)</strong></p>
    <p class="normal">This <a id="_idIndexMarker1064"/>protocol <a id="_idIndexMarker1065"/>is used for communication between a browser and a Web server.</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) (TCP port 443)</strong></p>
    <p class="normal">This <a id="_idIndexMarker1066"/>protocol <a id="_idIndexMarker1067"/>is a secure version of HTTP. It creates a secure communication channel between the browser and server.</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) (TCP port 3389)</strong></p>
    <p class="normal">This<a id="_idIndexMarker1068"/> protocol is used<a id="_idIndexMarker1069"/> to create a secure connection to another host. It is similar to Telnet and SSH, but the user has access to a GUI interface instead of the command line. This is a proprietary Microsoft protocol.</p>
    <h3 id="_idParaDest-249" class="heading-3">Transport layer protocols</h3>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)</strong></p>
    <p class="normal">A <a id="_idIndexMarker1070"/>connection-oriented protocol used for<a id="_idIndexMarker1071"/> the<a id="_idIndexMarker1072"/> reliable delivery of data.</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">User Datagram Protocol (UDP)</strong></p>
    <p class="normal">A <a id="_idIndexMarker1073"/>connectionless-oriented protocol <a id="_idIndexMarker1074"/>used for the fast delivery of data; it does not require the reliable delivery of data.</p>
    <h3 id="_idParaDest-250" class="heading-3">Internet layer protocols</h3>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Internet Protocol (IP)</strong></p>
    <p class="normal">The<a id="_idIndexMarker1075"/> Internet protocol is the Internet layer of the<a id="_idIndexMarker1076"/> TCP/IP stack, with the remaining Internet layer <a id="_idIndexMarker1077"/>protocols supporting it. This protocol is responsible for the delivery of data packets. This is accomplished solely based on the logical address, also known as the IP address. IP is a connectionless-oriented protocol. There are currently two versions, IPv6 and IPv4.</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)</strong></p>
    <p class="normal">ICMP is<a id="_idIndexMarker1078"/> the management <a id="_idIndexMarker1079"/>protocol and messaging service for IP. ICMP can provide information about issues within the network, such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList">Destination unreachable – this error is generated when the datagram is unable to reach the final destination.</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Echo request/reply – this is generated with the Ping command. It is used to test the network connection.</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Time exceeded (TTL) – when the packet fails to reach its destination within the specified number of hops. A hop is when the packet is sent from one router to another.</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Redirect – if the router is able to determine a more efficient route, a redirect message will be generated and sent to the host to update its routing table.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">Ping is a <a id="_idIndexMarker1080"/>utility that is used to identify issues with the network. Ping<a id="_idIndexMarker1081"/> will send a packet to the destination and then track how long it takes the destination server to respond. In the following <a id="_idIndexMarker1082"/>example, I used the <code class="inlineCode">ping</code> command to send packets to IP address <code class="inlineCode">104.22.1.175</code>, and you can see that the server responded, which took anywhere between nine and 14 milliseconds.</p>
    <pre class="programlisting con"><code class="hljs-con">User@Server ~ % ping packtpub.com
PING packtpub.com (104.22.1.175): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 104.22.1.175: icmp_seq=0 ttl=60 time=10.270 ms
64 bytes from 104.22.1.175: icmp_seq=1 ttl=60 time=9.949 ms

64 bytes from 104.22.1.175: icmp_seq=6 ttl=60 time=9.254 ms
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">If the ping command were unsuccessful, there would be a message that the destination host was unreachable or that there was no reply in the request timed out. This does not mean there are conductivity issues; system administrators have the option of blocking ICMP traffic that originates from outside of their local network, as shown in the example below.</p>
    <pre class="programlisting con"><code class="hljs-con">User@Server ~ % ping 192.168.86.22
PING 192.168.86.22 (192.168.86.22): 56 data bytes

Request timeout for icmp_seq 1
Request timeout for icmp_seq 2
Request timeout for icmp_seq 3
ping: sendto: No route to host
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)</strong></p>
    <p class="normal">ARP is <a id="_idIndexMarker1083"/>used to translate <a id="_idIndexMarker1084"/>logical addresses to physical addresses. This is accomplished when ARP sends a broadcast message to the hosts on the same network segment. The broadcast message asks the network interface device if it has a specific IP address. If the network interface device is assigned that IP address, then the network interface device will reply with the MAC address. ARP is a broadcast protocol that <a id="_idIndexMarker1085"/>will result in all hosts on the network <a id="_idIndexMarker1086"/>segment being able to see the request and replies. ARP requests are not routable, which means the ARP packets will not be able to cross router boundaries.</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Internet Protocol Security (IPSec)</strong></p>
    <p class="normal">IPSec is a <a id="_idIndexMarker1087"/>security protocol that <a id="_idIndexMarker1088"/>enhances security by providing end-to-end encryption and packet authentication. VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) utilize IPSec when creating their secure communication channels.</p>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-251" class="heading-1">Summary</h1>
    <p class="normal">In this chapter, we have discussed the fundamentals of a computer network. First, you learned about the differences between the OSI model and the TCP/IP (DoD) model. The OSI model is only theoretical and does not have a physical implementation. Don’t be confused when someone mentions the TCP/IP model when talking about the TCP/IP suite of protocols. We also looked at the different types of hardware you may find in a networking environment to understand the differences between a hub and a router. A router is a much more complex device responsible for sending data to the next hop. In contrast, a hub is only used to extend the network segment by giving additional hosts a location to connect to the network. A hub does not “do” anything; it merely creates an extension of the network.</p>
    <p class="normal">You should be able to explain the differences between a connection-oriented protocol and a connectionless-oriented protocol and in what situations each protocol should be used. For example, it would not be good to utilize a connection-oriented protocol when the throughput of data is the primary concern. The current IP addressing scheme is still being used, but changes are slowly coming and IPv6 will become the dominant protocol.</p>
    <p class="normal">An examiner should now be able to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList">Determine the differences between OSI and TCP/IP (DoD) models</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Determine which addressing scheme is being utilized on a network</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Understand the differences between a public IP address and a private IP address</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Understand the differences between a port number and an IP address</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Identify some of the commonly used protocols and ports</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">In the next chapter, we will cover report writing. The ability to draft a report so that the reader can understand a technical subject while using non-technical language is critical. If you cannot explain in writing how you did the exam file, it will affect your ability to be a successful investigator.</p>
