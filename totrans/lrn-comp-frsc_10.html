    <h1 id="_idParaDest-224" class="chapterTitle">Online Investigations</h1>
    <p class="normal">What information is available in the online environment? Did you identify a potential suspect? Are there databases that you can use to find information about potential targets of the investigation? Is it possible to conduct a sting operation using online resources? These are valid questions, and in most cases, the answer to these questions will be yes. When you ask someone to find information about an individual, one of the first searches will be conducted via Google. Google will give you a lot of information that may or may not be pertinent to the individual who is the search’s target. A Google search will provide you with many different threads that may need to be followed but can also lead you down a rabbit hole that may not provide any helpful information.</p>
    <p class="normal">Law enforcement and private organizations are conducting online investigations as we speak. Law enforcement is looking for criminal activity, such as adults looking to sexually exploit children. Private organizations are vetting potential new hires, maybe conducting opposition research on a competitor, and institutes of higher learning are researching numbers for the incoming class. I am sure you have read about a job offer or an offer to attend a college that has been rescinded because they discovered historical online information where the user had posted derogatory or inflammatory opinions.</p>
    <p class="normal">We will cover the following topics in this chapter:</p>

    </ul>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-225" class="heading-1">Undercover investigations</h1>
    <p class="normal">What is an online investigation? Is it a set of resources, or is it a user’s activity in the digital world? An online investigation<a id="_idIndexMarker925"/> is a systematic search of the internet to identify, preserve, analyze, and report on information relevant to the subject of the investigation. Most of us are familiar with someone being fired for something they posted online. It could be an insensitive tweet, a TikTok video filmed at work, or a Facebook post that could be considered offensive.</p>
    <p class="normal">Consider, in 2020 and 2021, the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList">Maryland fired Arthur Love<a id="_idIndexMarker926"/> because of his posts on Facebook that supported Kyle Rittenhouse. Love was the Deputy Director for the state of Maryland’s Office of Community Initiatives. The firing was because the postings contained “divisive images and statements.” Love has since filed a lawsuit stating Maryland violated his rights, and he should not be punished for content created on his private time and personal social media accounts.</li>
      <li class="bulletList">“Eli,” a barista for Starbucks, was fired after they posted a video to the social media platform TikTok. The video’s subject included a skit on how the baristas wanted to respond to demanding customers. Eli stated that no customers were present for the filming, no company equipment was damaged, and the filming occurred after the store was closed. Starbucks responded and said “Eli” was fired because all employees are expected “to create a respectful, safe, and welcoming environment.” Starbucks further stated “Eli” “demonstrated behavior not aligned with Starbucks Mission Values by posting content on TikTok that shows partners mocking customers.”</li>
      <li class="bulletList">The Third Circuit Court of Appeals stated that an employer could fire an employee based on social media posts. The case is “Ellis v. Bank of New York Mellon Corp.” The employee was fired after several postings advocating violence against protesters on her open Facebook account. Complaints were made to the employer about the postings. As a result, the bank conducted an internal investigation that included an employee interview. After the investigation, the bank terminated the employee for violating the bank’s Social Media Policy. The bank felt the posts were “offensive, demonstrated poor judgment, showed a lack of respect for others, and encouraged violent behavior.”</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">Open-source information can be a treasure trove of information relating to your investigation. </p>
    <div><p class="normal">Michael Brazzell authored the book “Open-Source Intelligence Techniques,” which is an extensive deep dive into using the internet as a resource. I will be providing an overview, but if you want to get deep into the weeds, I recommend his work. </p>
    </div>
    <p class="normal">Is information gathering an aspect<a id="_idIndexMarker927"/> of an undercover online investigation? Yes, absolutely. Is it possible for a non-law enforcement organization to conduct an undercover investigation, or is it just the purview of an agent of the government? No, it is not, commercial organizations conduct undercover online investigations for various reasons, such as opposition research on a competitor, an investigation into the theft of services, interacting with suspected “threat actor” to identify if the “threat actor” will target their organization, or any<a id="_idIndexMarker928"/> other reason, intending to protect the organization.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-226" class="heading-2">Undercover platform</h2>
    <p class="normal">Preparation is essential to conduct an online undercover investigation. </p>
    <p class="normal">Before starting an undercover online investigation, the first consideration<a id="_idIndexMarker929"/> is the platform you will use when interacting with other users. Do you want to use your personal desktop/laptop, the organization’s equipment, or start fresh with an entirely new desktop/laptop? You will want to make sure, whichever option you choose, that the platform is wiped clean of any prior information that may lead to the true identity of the undercover operative or the organization. Make sure that there isn’t any:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList">Spyware</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Malware</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Tracking Cookies</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Internet Cache</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">If you have any of the above-listed items on your platform, when you are using your true identity, it is possible that that information could compromise your undercover identity.</p>
    <p class="normal">When deciding which platform to use, you will want to ensure that the platform helps support your undercover identity. For example, if your undercover identity is supposed<a id="_idIndexMarker930"/> to be an elite threat actor with skills using the <strong class="keyWord">command-line interface</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">CLI</strong>), but you only interact with other users using the <strong class="keyWord">graphical user interface</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">GUI</strong>) of Windows 10, this discrepancy could<a id="_idIndexMarker931"/> cause your credibility to be questioned.</p>
    <p class="normal">Another consideration is that if your undercover online activities result in an arrest or proceedings in an administrative or civil environment, the platform you use will be treated as evidence. If you do not adequately remove all the data relating to your true identity, it is possible that information could be used against you. While in a perfect world, the obvious answer is to use only new equipment, unfortunately, that is not the reality. When you use previously used equipment as your platform, you must reformat and reinstall the operating system and any applications needed for the undercover online investigation. </p>
    <p class="normal">Once you have completed the process, the undercover investigator must exclusively use the platform for the undercover online investigation. </p>
    <p class="normal">You also want to ensure that your connection to the network is protected. For example, you will want to deploy an anti-malware/antivirus solution to monitor your platform and your connection<a id="_idIndexMarker932"/> to the network. In addition, you will want to use a <strong class="keyWord">virtual private networking</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">VPN</strong>) connection, which will allow you to obfuscate your location. The VPN will also encrypt your traffic from your platform to the destination, making it unreadable to anyone attempting to eavesdrop on your traffic. There are several free and paid VPN services you can use, along with the option of creating your own VPN.</p>
    <p class="normal">Another option to protect your online undercover identity<a id="_idIndexMarker933"/> is to use the onion network, also known as the Tor network. The Tor project is a non-profit<a id="_idIndexMarker934"/> organization whose mission is to “advance human rights and freedoms by creating and deploying free and open-source anonymity and privacy technologies, supporting unrestricted availability and use, and furthering their scientific and popular understanding.” The Tor project maintains the Tor network. The Tor network uses open-source software to create an overlay network enabled by volunteers. The Tor network allows users to maintain their anonymity by protecting their online activities. If the undercover operative uses or accesses the “dark web,” they will have to use the Tor network.</p>
    <p class="normal">Once the platform<a id="_idIndexMarker935"/> has been created, the next step is to create the online persona of the undercover online investigator.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-227" class="heading-2">Online persona</h2>
    <p class="normal">What is needed <a id="_idIndexMarker936"/>for an online persona? First, you are pretending<a id="_idIndexMarker937"/> to be another person, so you should have a similar online footprint to what the average user might have. You will want to ensure your undercover online persona will stand up to scrutiny.</p>
    <p class="normal">The first step in creating an undercover online persona is to create an email address. The obvious option is creating a free email account using a provider such as Gmail or Yahoo. Using a free provider will require providing an established email account or a non-voice over IP (VoIP) telephone account. In addition, some providers will allow you to create a disposable email address for verification purposes.</p>
    <div><p class="normal">A disposable email address is a method<a id="_idIndexMarker938"/> of using a unique email address for online interactions. This method provides the advantage that if the address is compromised or used for illegal activity, the user may quickly cancel it without impacting other online interactions.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="normal">You will find<a id="_idIndexMarker939"/> options for free<a id="_idIndexMarker940"/> and paid disposable<a id="_idIndexMarker941"/> accounts. The following<a id="_idIndexMarker942"/> is a sampling of disposable email providers:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList">Temp Mail <a href="https://temp-mail.org/en/">https://temp-mail.org/en/</a> </li>
      <li class="bulletList">Guerrilla Mail <a href="https://www.guerrillamail.com/">https://www.guerrillamail.com/</a></li>
      <li class="bulletList">Tutanota <a href="https://tutanota.com/">https://tutanota.com/</a></li>
      <li class="bulletList">ProtonMail <a href="https://protonmail.com/">https://protonmail.com/</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">The Guerrilla Mail interface is displayed below:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B18329_10_01.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 10.1: Guerrilla Mail interface</p>
    <p class="normal">Guerrilla Mail<a id="_idIndexMarker943"/> is a free service. When you go<a id="_idIndexMarker944"/> to the website, it will auto-generate<a id="_idIndexMarker945"/> a username, and then you can select the domain for the email account. There is also an option to create a “Scramble Address” to create an alias for the disposable email account.</p>
    <p class="normal">The undercover online investigator may have to make purchases or transmit funds to the targets of the investigation. You would not want to use any financial resources that can be traced back to your true identity or identify the organization you are working for. Cryptocurrency is perfect to use in this environment and under these restrictions. Cryptocurrency uses an encrypted data string and is administrated through a blockchain. The blockchain will also serve as the “ledger, “tracking the transactions to include when the cryptocurrency is transferred to another party. You will not find a centralized infrastructure that maintains the cryptocurrency; it is the decentralized process that allows for its anonymity. </p>
    <p class="normal">Bitcoin is a decentralized, open-source, peer-to-peer virtual currency that started in 2009. Some countries have accepted Bitcoin as legal tender, but mostly you will find a small amount of local and national governments using it in some capacity. Bitcoin has come to be recognized by the average consumer. And as a result, it is now being accepted by more and more organizations. A Bitcoin wallet is required to store the user’s Bitcoins. Several vendors provide digital wallets for users’ digital currencies. There are many digital currencies to choose from that are like Bitcoin. For example, in 2013, Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer released Dogecoin. This is considered the first “meme coin” because they created it as a joke, making fun of the speculation by investors into cryptocurrency. The official logo of Dogecoin is the face of the Shiba Inu.</p>
    <p class="normal">Also available to the undercover<a id="_idIndexMarker946"/> online investigator is the world of <strong class="keyWord">person-to-person</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">P2P</strong>) transactions. These are typically money<a id="_idIndexMarker947"/> transfers through<a id="_idIndexMarker948"/> an application on a mobile device or home computer system. Some applications include Cash App, Venmo, and Zelle. These applications are usually associated with the user’s credit card or bank account.</p>
    <p class="normal">Another option is prepaid credit/debit cards, which do not require personal identifiers.</p>
    <p class="normal">To create the particular details of the undercover online<a id="_idIndexMarker949"/> persona, I like to use the website Fake Name Generator (<a href="https://www.fakenamegenerator.com">https://www.fakenamegenerator.com</a>). This website provides a free service that can provide the name, address, email address, telephone number, mother’s maiden name, credit card numbers, national identification numbers, and customize the content to fit any region, nationality, or gender. In the screenshot below, you can see the interface for the fake name generator. </p>
    <p class="normal">The drop-down menus have been expanded to choose the gender, the name set, and country. You could create a name type if you so desire, such as American, German, hobbit, Klingon, and the ever-popular ninja. In the main body of the screenshot, you can see the generated information. </p>
    <p class="normal">The name Paul D. Walker has been created with an address in the state of Kentucky. We also have Walker’s phone number, birthday, zodiac sign, and some online artifacts. They created an actual email address for the persona and username/passwords.</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B18329_10_02.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 10.2: Fake Name Generator persona creation</p>
    <p class="normal">The following screenshot shows the persona’s physical characteristics, employment information, and credit<a id="_idIndexMarker950"/> card number. The website states they use<a id="_idIndexMarker951"/> a credit card number generator that creates a syntax valid credit card number. </p>
    <p class="normal">However, the expiration date is randomly generated, and the credit card prefix is not a valid entry to help prevent fraud.</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B18329_10_03.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 10.3: Remainder of the persona’s information</p>
    <p class="normal">The undercover online persona<a id="_idIndexMarker952"/> may also need a picture to help the believability<a id="_idIndexMarker953"/> of the persona. The<a id="_idIndexMarker954"/> website This Person Does Not Exist (<a href="https://thispersondoesnotexist.com">https://thispersondoesnotexist.com</a>) creates a random computer-generated image, and you can refresh the page to generate different images. </p>
    <p class="normal">The following screenshot shows a selection of images created by the website.</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B18329_10_04.png" alt="A group of people posing for the camera  Description automatically generated with medium confidence"/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure: 10.4: Random set of images from https://thispersondoesnotexist.com</p>
    <p class="normal">Mobile communications are next on the list to be anonymized. You can deploy several physical and digital methods to protect the true identity of the undercover investigator. Many pay-as-you-go cellular phone vendors offer a 1 to 3 months service plan, which sometimes will also include the mobile device. The communications company will usually bundle<a id="_idIndexMarker955"/> together voice and data services. For example, Mint Mobile (<a href="https://www.mintmobile.com">https://www.mintmobile.com</a>) offers services for $15 a month. If a mobile device is needed, the monthly cost increases from $20 to $44 a month. You will have the option of receiving a OnePlus n200 phone, a Samsung Galaxy A02, or an Apple iPhone SE.</p>
    <p class="normal">A digital option is Fake Caller ID (<a href="https://fakecallerid.io">https://fakecallerid.io</a>), an application that you can use on either Apple<a id="_idIndexMarker956"/> or Android devices. The pricing for the service runs from $9.95 (60 credits) to $49.95 (350 credits). It allows the user to create a fake caller identification, change the user’s voice, record a call, and send a call directly to voicemail and international calling.</p>
    <p class="normal">To record voice communications, law enforcement must get approval from a judicial official to intercept wire, oral, and electronic communications. Suppose you are not a member of law enforcement. In that case, you still have to determine whether the state (this is for the United States, your local jurisdiction may have different rules and regulations for recording voice communications) is a one-party or a two-party consent state. A one-party consent state only requires permission from a single party in the communication channel to consent to be recorded; a two-party consent state requires the consent of both parties in the communication channel to consent to be recorded. There are only 12 two-party consent states in the United States. There may be some specific requirements, depending on the state. For example, Oregon only requires one party to consent for electronic communications but requires two-party consent for in-person communications. </p>
    <p class="normal">If you have ever called a vendor or organization and received a message that they will record the call for training purposes, they consider your action of staying<a id="_idIndexMarker957"/> on the line to be consent. If you tell the organization’s representative<a id="_idIndexMarker958"/> that you decline to be recorded, they will quickly end the call.</p>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-228" class="heading-1">Background searches</h1>
    <p class="normal">After identifying<a id="_idIndexMarker959"/> a potential target, the online investigator should start their reconnaissance of the subject. The investigator will need to be familiar with what resources are available online and offline. Some of the information that you may uncover may consist of the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList">Personal identifiers</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Physical location</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Social media activity</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Professional memberships/activity</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Participation in online groups</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">You may not have all the information to identify the subject’s online persona and connect the online persona<a id="_idIndexMarker960"/> with the physical persona. For example, if the subject has a common last name, it will be challenging to differentiate one John Smith from another John Smith. However, identifying the target’s email address may allow you to distinguish between the potential millions of hits for the common name “John Smith.”</p>
    <p class="normal">Even with an email address, you may not get any responses to your query. For example, suppose the subject of investigation is using the email address “<code class="inlineCode">badguy27@yahoo.com</code>,” and you do not get any responses. It could be because there is an error in the email address, a missing character, or a word was misspelled. </p>
    <p class="normal">The next step should be to validate the email address to determine if it is valid. Many online services<a id="_idIndexMarker961"/> will help you validate<a id="_idIndexMarker962"/> email addresses. Below<a id="_idIndexMarker963"/> are some<a id="_idIndexMarker964"/> of the services. Some<a id="_idIndexMarker965"/> are fee-based, while<a id="_idIndexMarker966"/> others only require<a id="_idIndexMarker967"/> you to create an account: </p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList">Email Hippo (<a href="https://tools.emailhippo.com/">https://tools.emailhippo.com/</a>)</li>

      <li class="bulletList">WhoisXML API (<a href="https://geekflare.com/email-verification-api/">https://geekflare.com/email-verification-api/</a>)</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">In the following example, I am using the WhoisXML API service. I entered the email address as shown below:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B18329_10_05.png" alt="Rectangle  Description automatically generated"/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 10.5: WhoisXML API input badguy27@yahoo.com</p>
    <p class="normal">WhoisXML API provided a response very quickly. The response is shown below:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B18329_10_06.png" alt="Graphical user interface, text, application  Description automatically generated"/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 10.6: WhoisXML API response for badguy27@yahoo.com</p>
    <p class="normal">As you can see, the email<a id="_idIndexMarker968"/> address “<code class="inlineCode">badguy27@yahoo.com</code>" is valid. Next, you may have to determine if that email account<a id="_idIndexMarker969"/> has been compromised in the past. Pastebin (<a href="https://pastebin.com/">https://pastebin.com/</a>) is a website where users are allowed to create public posts, “pastes,” which contain content in plain text. It is prevalent for users to share code or any other text-based content such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList">Content that exceeds Twitter’s character limit (users can include a link to the full content on Pastebin)</li>
      <li class="bulletList">A Google Docs alternative</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Site promotion</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Sharing source code</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Reposting banned material</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Sharing data sets obtained from a network breach</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Sharing content/links from the dark web</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">Content from the Sony Pictures attack, the InfraGard attack, and the Ring intrusion were all posted to Pastebin. </p>
    <p class="normal">There are several online sources where you could check to determine if an email address is a part<a id="_idIndexMarker970"/> of a compromised<a id="_idIndexMarker971"/> data set. The following<a id="_idIndexMarker972"/> is not an all-inclusive list but just a small sample of what can be found.</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList">PSBDMP (<a href="https://psbdmp.ws/">https://psbdmp.ws/</a>)</li>
      <li class="bulletList">have i been pwned? (<a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/">https://haveibeenpwned.com/</a>)</li>
      <li class="bulletList">SpyCloud (<a href="https://spycloud.com/">https://spycloud.com/</a>)</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">Using “have i been pwned?” I have entered the email address “<code class="inlineCode">badguy27@yahoo.com</code>" to determine if this email account has been involved in any network attack/compromise.</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B18329_10_07.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 10.7: have i been pwned? search for badguy27@yahoo.com</p>
    <p class="normal">In the below screenshot, you will see that the email address “<code class="inlineCode">badguy27@yahoo.com</code>" has been involved in two data<a id="_idIndexMarker973"/> breaches, the MySpace data breach in 2008 and the Gravatar data breach in 2020.</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B18329_10_08.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 10.8: have i been pwned? results for badguy27@yahoo.com</p>
    <p class="normal">So far, we have determined that the email address is valid, but it may be compromised. If you are involved in a criminal investigation and the matter is going before a judicial hearing or adjudication, the opposing counsel may try to use a “threat actor” defense. An email address was involved with data breaches, but it does not automatically equate to being compromised. If you gain access to the subject’s digital devices, you would want to make sure that the devices have not been compromised. </p>
    <p class="normal">You will want to be proactive, rule out the “threat actor” defense before the opposition, can start to use it as a defense.</p>
    <p class="normal">An online investigator can also use usernames to help identify the potential target. It is not uncommon for users to use the same username across different accounts. For example, when using the email address <code class="inlineCode">badguy27@yahoo.com</code>, the username “bad guy 27” may be used for various email providers such as Gmail or AOL. The user may also use it for social media such as Facebook, Instagram, or TikTok. Therefore, you will want to use the term “bad guy 27” or variations of that username when conducting a background check of the target.</p>
    <p class="normal">Knowem (<a href="https://knowem.com">knowem.com</a>) is a website that allows users<a id="_idIndexMarker974"/> to search for usernames across many different platforms. The stated purpose of the website is to enable users to discover if their trademark, copyright, or brand name is being used without their permission.</p>

    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 10.9: Knowem search for badguyneedslove</p>
    <p class="normal">Once you enter the username<a id="_idIndexMarker975"/> and start the search, the service will start searching through social media and other websites and will tell you if the username is “available,” or if the term “available” is crossed and grayed out, it is an indication that the username is being used on that site.</p>

    <p class="normal">The below screenshot shows that the username “badguyneedslove” is available on several websites. The results that we are looking for are the websites where the word “available” is grayed out, such as the entry for Facebook.com. </p>
    <p class="normal">When we add the username URL <a href="https://www.facebook.com/badguyneedslove">www.facebook.com/badguyneedslove</a>, you now get the Facebook<a id="_idIndexMarker976"/> page for the potential target.</p>

    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 10.11: Facebook and Twitter results</p>
    <p class="normal">It is certainly allowed<a id="_idIndexMarker977"/> to conduct a person search via the Google search engine. Just be prepared to have to sort through the search results hoping to get a hit on your target. There are search engines that are designed to search for people specifically. These people search engines generally allow you to retrieve basic information about your subject and then request a fee before providing any in-depth results. Below are some of the more common people search engines, and the list is not exhaustive. I recommend using multiple people search engines to ensure that you get the best available information. When I have used the search engines, the accuracy I get has varied from search engine to search engine, but I compile all of the results into a single document.</p>
    <p class="normal">I have discovered current and past addresses, current and past landline and cellular telephone numbers, immediate and extended family members, current and past accounts, and birthdays. In some cases, I was able to determine their voter registration and neighbors.</p>
    <p class="normal">The people search<a id="_idIndexMarker978"/> engine I use first is True People Search (<a href="https://truepeoplesearch.com/">https://truepeoplesearch.com/</a>).</p>

    <p class="normal">When searching True People Search, you have the option of searching by name, telephone number, or address.</p>
    <p class="normal">When you select the search<a id="_idIndexMarker979"/> results, you will then be presented with the subject’s first and last name, their age and year of birth, their current address, and phone numbers. You can have a map created showing the current address, as well as obtaining all phone numbers associated with that subject. (As shown below).</p>

    <p class="normal">The following field will then contain the current email addresses associated with the subject. The search engine <a id="_idIndexMarker980"/>does not date the email addresses, making it more challenging to determine if the user is still utilizing the email accounts. The user can select a dialogue button to view additional email addresses that may be associated with the subject. Remember, it is up to you to validate these results; there is no guarantee that these results return to the physical person conducting your reconnaissance. There are times when you may get false positives while conducting your<a id="_idIndexMarker981"/> reconnaissance on the subject.</p>

    <p class="normal">There are many services available for you to conduct people searches. Far too many for me to include all of them in this book. As you become aware of which sites are available for people searches, you can start creating your list of people search engines that you prefer. </p>
    <p class="normal">As I stated before, True People Search is one of the first people search engines I use. The following also provides information on the subject of your searches. There will be some overlap with the results; you’ll have to analyze the results to determine if the information that is being provided applies to the subject you’re investigating. Below<a id="_idIndexMarker982"/> are some of the additional<a id="_idIndexMarker983"/> people search engines<a id="_idIndexMarker984"/> that I have used<a id="_idIndexMarker985"/> in the past:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList">Whitepages – <a href="https://www.whitepages.com/">https://www.whitepages.com/</a></li>
      <li class="bulletList">ZabaSearch – <a href="https://zabasearch.com/">https://zabasearch.com/</a></li>
      <li class="bulletList">People Search Now – <a href="https://peoplesearchnow.com/">https://peoplesearchnow.com/</a></li>
      <li class="bulletList">Spokeo – <a href="https://www.spokeo.com/">https://www.spokeo.com/</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">Next, we will discuss how<a id="_idIndexMarker986"/> to preserve the aspects of your online investigation so that you may properly document your efforts and present your evidence in an administrative or judicial proceeding.</p>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-229" class="heading-1">Preserving online communications</h1>
    <p class="normal">Did an investigation happen<a id="_idIndexMarker987"/> if you conducted the investigation and failed to document your efforts? Your ability to record your investigative efforts is as critical as the investigative states themselves. You have to document your efforts in the results. You must include those results which are positive as well as negative. When the online investigator is performing investigative activities, there must be documentation. This requirement requires you to either capture your efforts retroactively or in real time as it occurs.</p>
    <p class="normal">Screen captures are an effective method of capturing what is viewed on the display. However, the screenshot must focus on the artifact or behavior you capture for screen capture to be effective. What I mean is that when a screen capture is taken, the capture needs to focus on what is important. For example, capturing a desktop with six or seven windows open does not effectively communicate to a third party what is pertinent. Both macOS and Windows OS can natively capture what is displayed on the screen.</p>
    <p class="normal">With macOS, you can do a Spotlight Search by pressing the <em class="keystroke">command</em> key and <em class="keystroke">spacebar</em> (&lt;Command&gt; + &lt;Spacebar&gt;) at the same time (as shown below.)</p>

    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 10.17: Spotlight Search – “screenshot”</p>
    <p class="normal">With the Windows operating system, you have the Snipping Tool, which is being migrated to the new Snip and Sketch tool. Both tools provide the same functionality. Below is an example of the interface you may experience when using the Snipping Tool or the Snip and Sketch tool.</p>

    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 10.18: MS Windows – Snipping Tool and Snip and Sketch</p>
    <p class="normal">Using video to record the screen<a id="_idIndexMarker988"/> as the events occur is also an option. Using a macOS-based system, you will have access to the free utility QuickTime Player. QuickTime Player can record video using a USB camera and create a screen recording of what is displayed by the monitor. If you are recording audio, make sure if you have any colleagues around that they know you are recording. It can be very frustrating 30 minutes into the recording when one of your coworkers lets out a loud expletive in the middle of your court exhibit. </p>

    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 10.19: QuickTime Player menu</p>
    <p class="normal">When using Microsoft Windows, you can use the <em class="keystroke">Windows Key</em> + <em class="keystroke">Alt</em> + <em class="keystroke">R</em> to start screen recording. A small recording widget will appear. Repeat using the <em class="keystroke">Windows</em> <em class="keystroke">Key</em> + <em class="keystroke">Alt</em> + <em class="keystroke">R</em> to stop screen recording or left-click on the stop button on the widget. A notification will appear, <em class="italic">Game clip recorded</em>. The system will save the video in the user’s <code class="inlineCode">Videos/Captures</code> folder.</p>
    <p class="normal">The Edge browser can capture webpages. Using the keyboard, press on the <em class="keystroke">Control</em>, <em class="keystroke">Shift</em>, +<em class="keystroke">S</em> key to bring up the interface.</p>

    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 10.20: Edge browser capture menu</p>
    <p class="normal">Another option to save the data<a id="_idIndexMarker989"/> being displayed via<a id="_idIndexMarker990"/> the browser is the tool Hunchly (<a href="https://www.hunch.ly/">https://www.hunch.ly/</a>). It is not uncommon for an online investigator to start with one tab open on their browser while working through the investigation. As the investigator finds additional investigative leads, additional tabs are then opened. Soon there are many tabs open from following the threads of the investigation. If the investigator did not take appropriate notes/documentation, it could be challenging to go back and accurately preserve what the investigator has seen. The tool Hunchly helps avoid that dilemma. The investigator will have to use a Chrome-based browser and install the Hunchly application. </p>
    <p class="normal">The application will also install an extension to the browser.</p>

    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 10.21: Hunchly extension menu</p>
    <p class="normal">Hunchly does provide a free 30-day trial, after which you can purchase a year-long license for a very reasonable cost.</p>
    <p class="normal">Once you activate Hunchly<a id="_idIndexMarker991"/> via the extension, it will monitor your progress as you switch from webpage to webpage. If you open additional tabs, Hunchly will also record those websites. For example, in the below screenshot, you can see the active <strong class="screenText">Case</strong> and next, you will see an indicator for <strong class="screenText">Pages viewed</strong> and <strong class="screenText">Searches</strong> with a number below the headings. I have visited ten web pages in this trial run and conducted six searches.</p>

    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 10.22: Hunchly desktop</p>
    <p class="normal">One of the websites I visited was the <strong class="keyWord">American Kennel Club</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">AKC</strong>) website, and I looked at the breed<a id="_idIndexMarker992"/> information for Miniature Schnauzer. I also did some Google image searches for Miniature Schnauzers. In the below screenshot, the dashboard shows what pages I visited, along with a date and time stamp.</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B18329_10_23.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 10.23: Hunchly history</p>
    <p class="normal">Hunchly does not only collect<a id="_idIndexMarker993"/> the visual aspect of the webpage, but it also collects embedded data such as email addresses, IP addresses, Google analytics, and in some cases, GPS coordinates. For example, in the below screenshot, you can see the page preview for the American Kennel Club, and directly above and centered in the preview is the <strong class="screenText">Data</strong> button.</p>

    <p class="normal">In this case, 311 data entries have been recovered from the website. In the screenshot below, you can see entries for Google Analytics, Facebook tracking, email addresses, and IP addresses. All of this information was embedded within the website.</p>

    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 10.25 Hunchly Data view</p>
    <p class="normal">Hunchly also allows the user to export the captured data to a PDF file. This will enable you to create a physical copy if you need to disseminate your investigative actions.</p>
    <p class="normal">This is just<a id="_idIndexMarker994"/> one option<a id="_idIndexMarker995"/> that you can<a id="_idIndexMarker996"/> use to capture<a id="_idIndexMarker997"/> webpages; you<a id="_idIndexMarker998"/> can also use<a id="_idIndexMarker999"/> one of the following options:</p>

    <p class="normal">This list is not exhaustive; there may be other utilities that will perform the same functionality. Some utilities are free to use, some are reasonably priced, and some are very expensive. Your specific situation will determine which utilities you will be able to use. It does not matter which utility you use; some paid utilities have the same functionality as a free utility. However, you are paying for the customer support that comes with the expense of the utility, while with a free utility, you may have to do your research<a id="_idIndexMarker1000"/> to solve a problem you may be having. Ultimately the goal is to be proficient in the use of the utilities that you use. You also must understand what is occurring underneath the visual interface of the utility.</p>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-230" class="heading-1">Summary</h1>
    <p class="normal">In this chapter, we have discussed an online investigation. We have looked at undercover operations and how to create a persona that the online investigator can use. You never want to use your personal online identity to investigate. If the target of your investigation can determine your true identity and you have been using your personal online persona, you could put yourself in danger. We also looked at the various options that investigators can use to identify a subject to conduct background investigations. A person may have no digital footprint, but I would find that very unlikely. By using open-source information, you may be able to collect that data set without alerting the target. Finally, you will want to document all of your investigative endeavors. </p>
    <p class="normal">You can do this by using screenshots, videos, and website capture. You should now be able to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList">Determine ways to collect personal information about an individual from online sources</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Determine how investigations are performed online</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Determine how to preserve internet communications, video, photos, and other content that is important to a case</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">In the next chapter, we will cover networking basics. Understanding how data is transmitted across the internet will be crucial to understanding where to find the artifacts that will help you prove or disprove the allegations you are investigating.</p>
