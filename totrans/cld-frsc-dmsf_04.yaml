    computing has become the preferred choice for many organizations looking to modernize
    their IT infrastructure and take advantage of the benefits of cloud adoption.
    As incident responders, it is important to focus on the digital forensics of popular
    cloud service providers due to their widespread adoption by organizations. Among
    the top cloud service providers on the market, you will most likely encounter
    three main cloud providers in your next cloud forensics project: **Amazon Web
    Services** (**AWS**), **Microsoft Azure**, and **Google Cloud** **Platform** (**GCP**).'

    artifacts may be stored is crucial for organizations looking to ensure the security
    of their data and applications, as well as being crucial for incident responders
    looking to respond to security incidents. Each cloud service provider has its
    own architecture and security controls, which must be understood to ensure that
    forensic investigations are conducted effectively. For example, AWS, Azure, and
    GCP all have different approaches to data storage, access control, and logging,
    which can impact forensic investigations.

    of services to help organizations build and deploy their applications and infrastructure.
    AWS offers infrastructure and computing resources at scale and allows organizations
    to virtualize their entire IT infrastructure in the cloud, making AWS a critical
    tool for many organizations. Incident responders, in particular, need to have

    virtualized infrastructure or servers (also known as virtual machines) and run
    them in the cloud. EC2 enables organizations to have complete control over their
    computing resources and provides a scalable and flexible infrastructure for building
    applications. With EC2, organizations can launch and manage virtual servers called
    instances, which can be configured with different computing capabilities, storage
    capacities, and networking features. It is important to note, for DFIR teams,
    that AWS refers to these virtual machines as *instances* and each virtual machine
    is identified using an instance identifier.

    of all sizes. First, it offers on-demand scalability, which means organizations
    can easily adjust their computing resources as their needs change. EC2 also provides
    a high level of availability, with multiple Availability Zones and automatic failover
    capabilities. Additionally, EC2 is highly customizable, allowing organizations
    to choose from a wide range of instance types, operating systems, and software
    configurations.

    The AWS CLI is a powerful tool provided by AWS that allows organizations to manage
    their AWS resources and services through a CLI. As an example, organizations can
    create an instance by running a specific command, such as `aws ec2 run-instances`,
    followed by the necessary parameters you would normally define through the GUI,
    such as instance type, security groups, and key pairs. This enables organizations
    to automate the process of instance creation and provisioning in AWS, enhancing
    efficiency and scalability.

    flexible and scalable infrastructure for responding to security incidents. EC2
    instances can be quickly spun up (i.e., through the creation of new virtual machines)
    to handle increased workloads during an incident. EC2 instances can be easily
    isolated and quarantined, allowing incident responders to contain the incident
    and prevent it from spreading to other parts of the organization.

    resources and isolate them within the VPC. They can then use AWS tools, such as
    AWS CloudTrail and AWS CloudWatch, to monitor network traffic and identify any
    suspicious activity. Incident responders can also leverage the VPC’s custom network

    organizations’ data storage and backup strategies, and it is used for a wide range
    of use cases, including data lakes, web and mobile applications, backups, and
    disaster recovery. AWS refers to each S3 instance as a **bucket** and, by default,
    when an organization creates an S3 bucket, it is not publicly available on the
    internet. You will need to make necessary changes to allow public accessibility
    over the internet. However, do note, misconfigurations in S3 buckets will allow

    revoking access to AWS resources for specific organizations or groups. This can
    help to contain the impact of an incident and prevent further unauthorized access

    use Azure SQL Database to identify potential attack vectors and investigate the
    extent of the compromise. Incident responders can analyze Azure SQL Database logs
    to identify anomalous database activity, such as unauthorized access attempts
    or data modifications. Incident responders can also use Azure SQL Database security
    features, such as auditing and row-level security, to investigate and mitigate
    the impact of a security incident.

    First, GCE provides organizations with a range of custom machine types optimized
    for different workloads, allowing organizations to choose the optimal configuration
    for their applications and services. Second, GCE provides organizations with access
    to Google’s global network infrastructure and data centers, which can provide
    faster network performance and lower latency than other cloud providers. Finally,
    GCE provides organizations with integrated monitoring and logging tools, such
    as Google’s operations suite (formerly known as Stackdriver), which can simplify
    the process of managing and monitoring virtual machine instances. Incident responders
    can use monitoring and logging tools such as Google’s operations suite to look
    for any indicators of compromise in the context of a security incident.

    manage their private, software-defined network on GCP. Google VPC provides a secure
    and scalable way to host cloud resources by allowing organizations to isolate
    resources within their network, control access to them, and configure network
    settings according to their business needs.

- en: Google VPC allows organizations to create their virtual network within the GCP
    environment. This virtual network is logically isolated from other networks, providing
    a secure and private environment for cloud resources. Organizations can customize
    network settings such as IP addresses, subnets, firewall rules, and routes, according
    to their business requirements. This way, organizations can control the flow of
    traffic between resources and ensure that only authorized users can access the
    resources. An example of a Google VPC network is shown in the following diagram.
    Note the similar role of Google VPC to that of AWS VPC and Azure Virtual Network,
    that is, to manage virtualized resources such as a virtual machine in a virtual
    network.

    and failover capabilities. Google Cloud SQL is a fully managed RDS that provides
    organizations with a solution to store and manage their databases on GCP. This
    service allows users to deploy, manage, and scale their databases with ease, freeing

    Alibaba Cloud, Rackspace, and DigitalOcean are some examples of less common cloud
    service providers. Each provider offers essential cloud services, such as creating
    virtual images and virtual networks, cloud storage, and database services—these
    are the same services we discussed previously for AWS, Azure, and GCP. Oracle
    Cloud, for instance, provides comprehensive cloud computing solutions, including
    IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS, while IBM Cloud offers a hybrid cloud platform that integrates
    with private and public clouds. Alibaba Cloud is the largest cloud provider in
    China, while Rackspace provides managed cloud services, and DigitalOcean focuses
    on simple cloud infrastructure for developers.

    analysis. In the next chapter, we will take a deep dive into responding to AWS
    incidents—specifically where various logs for AWS products are stored and how
    they can be utilized for conducting your forensic analysis in the context of a
    security incident.
