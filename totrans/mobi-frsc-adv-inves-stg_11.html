    <p>In this book, we have covered a number of forensic tools by ElcomSoft and Oxygen Forensics. We covered these tools as we are involved in their development and we also have lengthy experience using them. However, the market for mobile forensic tools is not limited to the small bunch of products reviewed in this book. There are more well-known and truly excellent tools available.</p>

      <p>Cellebrite (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.cellebrite.com/">http://www.cellebrite.com/</a>) offers an extensive range of tools for mobile forensics under their <span class="strong"><strong>Universal Forensic Extraction Device</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>UFED</strong></span>) umbrella. UFED Physical Analyzer, UFED Cloud Analyzer, UFED Logical Analyzer, UFED Phone Detective, and more are available from Cellebrite.</p>

      <p>Cellebrite developed a number of unique technologies that are unmatched by competitors. This includes the ability to acquire a number of devices (such as those equipped with Qualcomm chipsets, a number of Lumia smartphones, and so on) via a company-developed bootloader exploit (<a class="ulink" href="http://blog.cellebrite.com/blog/tag/android-forensics/">http://blog.cellebrite.com/blog/tag/android-forensics/</a>). This acquisition method is clean, robust, and forensically sound. In certain cases, UFED can be the only acquisition tool that can do the job.</p>

    <p>In this chapter, we'll review some typical scenarios that call for different approaches and tools when handling mobile acquisition.</p>

      <p> <span class="emphasis"><em>I have a ton of iPhones in my lab. Only get to spend about 40 minutes on each. What can you get me in 40 minutes?</em></span> </p>

      <p>This is a typical question coming from a police officer working in a busy environment. What can be done on these iPhones in such a restricted timeframe?</p>

      <p>It depends on what's available. If all you have is a working but locked iPhone, and the passcode is not known, the only chance of extracting anything off the phone is to attempt physical acquisition. If the phone falls within the compatibility matrix, you can follow these steps to extract information out of the device. With its characteristic-guaranteed timeframe, physical acquisition is the only way to obtain information out of a locked device.</p>

      <p>If you know the user's Apple ID and password, you can use Elcomsoft Phone Breaker to perform a selective download of essential information, such as call logs, geolocation information, address book, messages, and so on from iCloud. Selective downloading can help jump-start your investigation, while you can continue downloading the rest of the data in the background.</p>

      <p>If you have the user's computer, hard drive, or forensic disk image of that hard drive, you may also have other options available. For example, the hard drive may contain a binary authentication token, allowing you to connect to iCloud and download information right away, without knowing the user's passcode, Apple ID, and account password.</p>

      <p>The computer may also contain a local backup copy of information stored in the iOS device. If the backup is not password-protected, you can access data instantly with Elcomsoft Phone Viewer. If, however, the backup is protected with an unknown password, you can attempt to break this password, although there can be no timeframe guarantee.</p>

      </div>

      <p>Accessing information stored in employees' corporate smartphones is often required during internal investigations. Having real-time access to such data helps investigate or prevent leaks of sensitive information carried on or transmitted with a smartphone.</p>

      <p>In corporate environments, breaking into employee devices is rarely a problem. With recovery key deposit and obligatory recovery procedures for corporate online phone accounts in place, combined with the complete ban on jailbroken devices demanded by most corporate security policies make physical acquisition impossible/unnecessary. Instead, corporations commonly use online access to phone data.</p>

      <p>In the case of Apple iOS devices, companies can access data stored in their employee's corporate smartphones by downloading information from iCloud. iCloud downloads are performed transparently and without requiring the original Apple device.</p>

      <p>Until very recently, one could use Elcomsoft Phone Breaker to download iCloud data without the end user's knowledge. However, Apple has modified its security policies. Apple automatically sends an e-mail notification to the user's registered Apple ID when someone attempts to download their iCloud backup. A notification is delivered to a registered e-mail address when accessing iCloud backups from a new IP address. However, the notification is not sent when accessing application data such as <span class="strong"><strong>Keynotes</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Pages</strong></span>, or <span class="strong"><strong>Numbers</strong></span> documents. These notifications are designed to prevent spying on unsuspecting users, notifying the user that their data is being downloaded.</p>
