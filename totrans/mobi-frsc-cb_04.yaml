- en: Mobile devices running Windows Phone OS and Blackberry OS become objects of
    forensic analysis less and less frequently. The peak of popularity of such devices
    has already passed. Nevertheless, experts should know methods of data extraction
    from these devices. These methods will be described in this chapter.

- en: Devices running Windows Phone OS are Microsoft's attempt to enter the mobile
    devices market with its own OS. Devices running Windows Phone OS appeared on the
    market in 2010\. The majority of these devices were produced by Nokia (which is
    owned by Microsoft). However, there are models that were produced by such companies
    as HTC, LG, Lenovo, and Samsung. In order to avoid confusion, it should be remembered
    that the old versions (7 and 8) of this OS were called Windows Phone. The newest
    operating system of this family is called Windows 10 Mobile.

    the company's own OS, BlackBerry OS, is used on BlackBerry mobile devices. In
    order to extract data from such devices, an expert needs to know a username and
    account password (BlackBerry ID). This information is required for data decryption,
    which is stored in the phone's memory or in its backups.
